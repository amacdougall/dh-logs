[Wed Nov 19 18:59:47 2003] : <B>(1) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>The lunch rush seems to be dying down; office workers are filing back into their buildings, abandoning the park benches that surround Berthold Square's central fountain.</font><br>
[Wed Nov 19 19:00:52 2003] : <B>(1) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>As the square clears somewhat, you see that it is dotted with vendors' carts; most are food vendors, serving the commerce sector everything from shell-roasted crab to spiced nut rolls to full-menu short-order fare.</font><br>
[Wed Nov 19 19:01:31 2003] : <B>(1) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>It's almost impossible to decide what looks best; but one cart stands out from the rest, largely by dint of a hand-lettered wooden sign propped up in front of it: "Not Dead Anymore: 20% discount all day!"</font><br>

[Wed Nov 19 19:02:05 2003] : <B>(1) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>Once this singular sign draws your eyes to the cart, you notice that it is festooned with plaques, medals, and trophies.</font><br>
[Wed Nov 19 19:02:26 2003] : <B>(1) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>A few of the other carts nearby also display such mementoes, but not in such wooly profusion.</font><br>
[Wed Nov 19 19:03:03 2003] : <B>(1) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>Either this food vendor has won everything at least twice, or he makes a habit of buying up old trophies at rummage sales and wallpapering his establishment with them.</font><br>
[Wed Nov 19 19:03:24 2003] : <B>(4) Rien</B>: <font color='#521010'>I'm hoping it's the former rather than the latter</font><br>
[Wed Nov 19 19:03:25 2003] : <B>(1) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>As you approach, you notice that one of the trophies is for a spelling bee, lending a certain credence to the latter theory.</font><br>
[Wed Nov 19 19:04:34 2003] : <B>(1) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>But then another is a first-place medal for the Medice & Flaeli Memorial Cookoff, Gereval's biggest cooking contest. You vaguely remember it from a magazine article.</font><br>

[Wed Nov 19 19:11:26 2003] : <B>(1) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>Carragio gets to work; you've never seen anything quite like it.

[Wed Nov 19 19:12:10 2003] : <B>(1) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>...but at the same time, he's tossing his utensils from hand to hand, performing dangerous swoops, flipping food in trajectories that seem to invite doom before he catches them in frying pans held nearly perpendicular to the ground.</font><br>
[Wed Nov 19 19:12:26 2003] : <B>(1) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>It's almost like watching a warrior perform a weapons kata.</font><br>
