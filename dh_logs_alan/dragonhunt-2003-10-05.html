[Sun Oct 05 23:47:14 2003] : <B>(1) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>"Faith is a not an answer, Initiate," Father Blackhall says. Though he is only a few inches taller than you, his mighty frame seems to loom like a mountain, and he casts you into the shadow of the office's lone lantern.</font><br>
[Sun Oct 05 23:47:27 2003] : <B>(1) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>"Faith is a question."</font><br>
[Sun Oct 05 23:48:19 2003] : <B>(1) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>This isn't part of dogma; the catechism doesn't cover it. Father Blackhall called you into his office after an ill-planned prank left five proctors covered in custard and Ricard denouncing you in ringing tones.</font><br>
[Sun Oct 05 23:48:31 2003] : <B>(1) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>But you expected a dressing-down, not a philosophical discussion.</font><br>
[Sun Oct 05 23:48:57 2003] : <B>(2) Aryk</B>: <font color='#000080'>Aryk thinks for a moment.  "More like a belief, isn't it?"  Aryk hides his smirk as best he can.</font><br>
[Sun Oct 05 23:49:25 2003] : <B>(1) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>Father Blackhall seems to believe that this discussion is of the greatest importance; both your guardian angels are waiting in the hall, out of earshot.</font><br>
[Sun Oct 05 23:50:06 2003] : <B>(1) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>Father Blackhall leans forward, and the lamp shines out from just above his lowered head, reflecting off his bald skull.</font><br>
[Sun Oct 05 23:50:21 2003] : <B>(1) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>"Belief is an interruption of faith. If it is necessary to believe, then faith itself is already lost."</font><br>
[Sun Oct 05 23:50:32 2003] : <B>(1) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>"Faith is water to a fish; belief is water to a man."</font><br>
[Sun Oct 05 23:50:58 2003] : <B>(1) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>"The man feels thirsty; the fish does not know there is a world without it."</font><br>
[Sun Oct 05 23:51:58 2003] : <B>(2) Aryk</B>: <font color='#000080'>Aryk winces from the glare off his head.  "So then... if faith is a question, then... what is... the question?"</font><br>
[Sun Oct 05 23:52:13 2003] : <B>(2) Aryk</B>: <font color='#000080'>"And... what's that got to do with water again?"</font><br>
[Sun Oct 05 23:52:53 2003] : <B>(1) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>"The purest of faith is that which has never been tested, Initiate. And I know that your faith is pure."</font><br>
[Sun Oct 05 23:53:12 2003] : <B>(2) Aryk</B>: <font color='#000080'>Aryk doesn't reply.</font><br>
[Sun Oct 05 23:53:17 2003] : <B>(1) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>"But I know, also, that your schooling nears completion; and your faith cannot remain pure for much longer."</font><br>
[Sun Oct 05 23:53:37 2003] : <B>(1) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>Father Blackhall reaches behind him, and picks up the twisted black staff that is never more than a meter away from his body.</font><br>
[Sun Oct 05 23:53:40 2003] : <B>(2) Aryk</B>: <font color='#000080'>Aryk thinks of his plans to travel to Parnesse.  </font><br>
[Sun Oct 05 23:53:47 2003] : <B>(1) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>"You know what <i>this</i> is."</font><br>
[Sun Oct 05 23:53:50 2003] : <B>(1) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>It is a Sorcery Staff.</font><br>
[Sun Oct 05 23:54:00 2003] : <B>(2) Aryk</B>: <font color='#000080'>"Yes, father."</font><br>
[Sun Oct 05 23:54:28 2003] : <B>(1) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>Writhing within its blackened length is the twisted and utterly evil soul and power of a mighty Sorcerer, evillest of humans...</font><br>
[Sun Oct 05 23:54:58 2003] : <B>(1) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>...four years ago, Father Blackhall wrested the staff from the dying diabolist's grip personally, and in doing so, took up a terrible burden.</font><br>
[Sun Oct 05 23:55:33 2003] : <B>(1) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>You were there; with Keystone Daine and a dozen others, you formed the shield-wall that finally broke through the Sorcerer's line of tortured angels.</font><br>
[Sun Oct 05 23:55:48 2003] : <B>(1) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>A "field trip" gone horribly awry.</font><br>
[Sun Oct 05 23:56:19 2003] : <B>(2) Aryk</B>: <font color='#000080'>Aryk shudders in his chair.</font><br>
[Sun Oct 05 23:56:49 2003] : <B>(1) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>"I do not speak of the Staff, because it cannot be truly understood by anyone but me," Blackhall says. "But when you touch it, you will understand what I mean about purity..."</font><br>
[Sun Oct 05 23:57:01 2003] : <B>(1) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>He holds the staff horizontally, in both hands, and extends it to you.</font><br>
[Sun Oct 05 23:57:16 2003] : <B>(1) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>His grip is white-knuckle tight.</font><br>
[Sun Oct 05 23:57:17 2003] : <B>(2) Aryk</B>: <font color='#000080'>"I don't wanna touch that thing!"</font><br>
[Sun Oct 05 23:57:56 2003] : <B>(1) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>"Nevertheless, you shall."</font><br>
[Sun Oct 05 23:58:58 2003] : <B>(2) Aryk</B>: <font color='#000080'>Reluctantly, Aryk gets up and inches toward the staff.  Slowly, he puts a finger on it, and then another, until he holds it in his right hand.</font><br>
[Sun Oct 05 23:59:16 2003] : <B>(1) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>Nothing happens, at first.</font><br>
[Sun Oct 05 23:59:37 2003] : <B>(2) Aryk</B>: <font color='#000080'>He holds slightly tighter.</font><br>
[Sun Oct 05 23:59:53 2003] : <B>(1) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>But after a few seconds, a deep and pervasive conviction arises in your mind:</font><br>
