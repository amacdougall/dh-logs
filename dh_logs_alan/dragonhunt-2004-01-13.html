[Tue Jan 13 20:44:36 2004] : <B>(1) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>"Good luck finding Demeign. The report says we were a bit ham-handed in there when we went looking for him."</font><br>
[Tue Jan 13 20:44:44 2004] : <B>(1) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>"They sent some rookies who didn't have contacts. Smart, huh?"</font><br>
[Tue Jan 13 20:44:53 2004] : <B>(1) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>"I think the gangs closed ranks there. It could get dangerous."</font><br>
[Tue Jan 13 20:45:15 2004] : <B>(2) Jenny</B>: <font color='#000080'>"Joy. You guys got anybody there *with* contacts?"</font><br>

[Tue Jan 13 20:51:18 2004] : <B>(1) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>"Nobody in the office right now knows much more than that. The Docklands cops are out there walking their beat right now, but going up and quizzing them would blow your goal of not looking like a cop." Hien chuckles.</font><br>
