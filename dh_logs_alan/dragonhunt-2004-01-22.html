[Thu Jan 22 18:44:02 2004] : <B>(1) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>Okay. You don't draw any special attention walking through the marina. It's been a warm day, but it'll still get nippy as the sun goes down, so there are only few people lounging around talking here.</font><br>
[Thu Jan 22 18:44:21 2004] : <B>(1) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>The conversations are the usual; business, relationships, small talk.</font><br>

[Thu Jan 22 20:48:51 2004] : <B>(6) Aryk</B> (whispering): <font color='#000080'>Dude, I have to go pretty soon.  I need to get up in 8 hours.  And I have to feed the cat.</font><br>
[Thu Jan 22 20:48:58 2004] : <B>(3) Rien</B>: <font color='#804000'>When i woke up again I was still over aryk's shoulder, so my instincts told me to play dead</font><br>
[Thu Jan 22 20:50:02 2004] : <B>(1) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>(Okay, we'll actually wind up on a bit of a cliffhanger here once you find Le Duc.)</font><br>
[Thu Jan 22 20:50:16 2004] : <B>(6) Aryk</B> (whispering): <font color='#000080'>Alright</font><br>
[Thu Jan 22 20:50:32 2004] : <B>(1) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>(9 pm seems like it's been our standard stop time, and these seem like good enough sessions.)</font><br>
[Thu Jan 22 20:50:51 2004] : <B>(6) Aryk</B>: <font color='#000080'>(10 pm for me)</font><br>
[Thu Jan 22 20:51:20 2004] : <B>(1) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>Rien, you don't have to ask around much before you're directed to the Floating Lyre, a pub made from a large houseboat.</font><br>
[Thu Jan 22 20:51:22 2004] : <B>(1) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>(Right.)</font><br>
[Thu Jan 22 20:52:04 2004] : <B>(3) Rien</B>: <font color='#804000'>(2pm for me :P)</font><br>
[Thu Jan 22 20:52:19 2004] : <B>(6) Aryk</B>: <font color='#000080'>(wow!)</font><br>
[Thu Jan 22 20:52:40 2004] : <B>(3) Rien</B>: <font color='#804000'>(Mind you...it's also friday for me)</font><br>
[Thu Jan 22 20:52:58 2004] : <B>(1) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>The gentle sway and roll of the boat seems conducive to a more reflective crowd; tonight, they seem to be having a poetry reading of some sort.</font><br>
[Thu Jan 22 20:53:06 2004] : <B>(3) Rien</B>: <font color='#804000'>(Yep)</font><br>
[Thu Jan 22 20:54:12 2004] : <B>(1) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>A raised platform at the far end of the pub has a soundstone pickup; a slender half-elf in yellow robes is reading a wistful and dreamlike poem about the fall of Uverlin.</font><br>
[Thu Jan 22 20:54:17 2004] : <B>(1) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>His elven features are very strong.</font><br>
[Thu Jan 22 20:54:32 2004] : <B>(3) Rien</B>: <font color='#804000'>(He sounds like Dannyl)</font><br>
[Thu Jan 22 20:55:01 2004] : <B>(1) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>"...and raise a goblet of volcanic glass from Uverlin's Maw; and fill it with blood-dark wine from elven veins; and drink to what is lost," he concludes, and leads by example.</font><br>
[Thu Jan 22 20:55:16 2004] : <B>(1) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>The audience claps quietly and drinks the toast with him.</font><br>
[Thu Jan 22 20:55:31 2004] : <B>(6) Aryk</B>: <font color='#000080'>"That must be our guy."</font><br>
[Thu Jan 22 20:55:46 2004] : <B>(2) Jenny</B> (whispering): <font color='#000080'>wow... he and Dorothy Durai should have a party... they'd drive the entire crowd into a mass murder-suicide...</font><br>
[Thu Jan 22 20:56:01 2004] : <B>(1) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>A much older half-elf takes the stage. "Thank you, Master Na&#239;lo, for that beautiful piece."</font><br>
[Thu Jan 22 20:56:19 2004] : <B>(1) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>The younger half-elf bows. "A tribute to your wisdom, my lord d'Uverlin."</font><br>
