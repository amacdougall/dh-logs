[Mon Jul 28 20:49:08 2003] : <B>(2) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>A particularly tall cliff, more like a mountain cut away completely into the ocean, reaches out into the sea. This must be the cape of which the captain spoke.</font><br>

[Mon Jul 28 20:50:34 2003] : <B>(2) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>It's a city built on cliff terraces, sandwiched between two broken mountains.</font><br>

[Mon Jul 28 20:51:04 2003] : <B>(2) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>Entire neighborhoods are separated by hundreds of feet, connected by huge commuter elevators, and long series of switchbacks.</font><br>
[Mon Jul 28 20:51:20 2003] : <B>(1) Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>"My word. How does anyone get anywhere?"</font><br>
[Mon Jul 28 20:51:38 2003] : <B>(2) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>The city's base is near sea level; its highest regions, further back, are about halfway up the two mountains.</font><br>
[Mon Jul 28 20:52:05 2003] : <B>(2) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>The city looks somewhat smaller than Ilium.</font><br>
[Mon Jul 28 20:52:39 2003] : <B>(2) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>"Elevators, my lady. Wooden platforms are moved up and down the cliffs by means of a pulley system, and ample unskilled labor."</font><br>
[Mon Jul 28 20:53:02 2003] : <B>(1) Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>"You mean, human labor? Why don't they use horses or mules?"</font><br>
[Mon Jul 28 20:53:11 2003] : <B>(2) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>"Furthermore," Godfrey continues, "there are extensive caves built into the cliffs, which house entire neighborhoods and commercial districts."</font><br>
[Mon Jul 28 20:53:23 2003] : <B>(2) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>"These caverns communicate by means of spiral staircases."</font><br>
[Mon Jul 28 20:54:06 2003] : <B>(1) Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>"My. Don't people feel a little shut in?"</font><br>
[Mon Jul 28 20:55:07 2003] : <B>(2) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>"It takes all sorts of people to make up a world," the captain says. "Some people are willing to bend their backs for cheaper than the cost of housing a mule; and some people are willing to live in a cave."</font><br>
[Mon Jul 28 20:55:33 2003] : <font color='#008000'>** (1) Renate thinks about that. **</font><br>
[Mon Jul 28 20:55:39 2003] : <B>(2) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>"It's a mite strange until you learn how Eridu works. There are hiring halls that provide the cheap labor for things like the elevators, and the factories."</font><br>
[Mon Jul 28 20:55:51 2003] : <B>(2) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>"And the hiring halls were run by some pretty rich people. And in Eridu, that's power."</font><br>
[Mon Jul 28 20:55:55 2003] : <B>(1) Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>"How much choice do they really have, Captain?" she asks, hoping it is not a stupid question.</font><br>
[Mon Jul 28 20:56:14 2003] : <B>(2) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>"So someone else tried to bring in animals to do the same work, and all of a sudden there were new licenses and taxes for him to pay."</font><br>
[Mon Jul 28 20:56:25 2003] : <B>(1) Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>"Oh."</font><br>
[Mon Jul 28 20:56:53 2003] : <B>(2) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>"You see how it works? Whoever has the money writes the rules... and once you can write the rules, it's easy to make money."</font><br>
[Mon Jul 28 20:57:20 2003] : <B>(1) Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>"I see."</font><br>
[Mon Jul 28 20:57:31 2003] : <B>(1) Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>It doesn't sound like a very pleasant system to Renate.</font><br>
[Mon Jul 28 20:58:18 2003] : <B>(1) Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>But perhaps it has advantages that aren't evident at first view.</font><br>
[Mon Jul 28 20:58:43 2003] : <B>(2) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>A pilot craft comes to meet the ship as it enters the harbor. Captain Highwind invites the pilot aboard, and allows him to take the command.</font><br>

[Mon Jul 28 20:59:35 2003] : <B>(1) Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>"Why don't they just leave, Godfrey?" she whispers. "Go to Ilium, or even Andragar?"</font><br>
[Mon Jul 28 20:59:46 2003] : <B>(1) Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>"It sounds about as bad as slavery."</font><br>
[Mon Jul 28 21:00:24 2003] : <B>(2) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>"There are people for whom options are few; they have little or no education, and little legal standing."</font><br>

[Mon Jul 28 21:00:56 2003] : <B>(2) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>"And in Eridu, there are jobs; whereas in Ilium, there are not."</font><br>
[Mon Jul 28 21:01:20 2003] : <font color='#008000'>** (1) Renate listens carefully. **</font><br>
[Mon Jul 28 21:01:22 2003] : <B>(2) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>"Some go to Ithaca, to live as miners... but mining is work just as difficult, with rewards just as scarce."</font><br>
[Mon Jul 28 21:01:39 2003] : <B>(1) Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>"It's a bleak world, Godfrey. I didn't know."</font><br>
[Mon Jul 28 21:01:54 2003] : <B>(1) Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>She feels ashamed of having been so sorry for herself.</font><br>
[Mon Jul 28 21:02:19 2003] : <B>(2) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>"There is bleakness and opportunity in equal measure; but it is true that these attributes tend to spread themselves among people, not among the moments of any one person's life."</font><br>
[Mon Jul 28 21:02:53 2003] : <B>(2) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>"That his life of hardship is balanced by the luxury of another is surely little consolation for one without opportunity for advancement."</font><br>
[Mon Jul 28 21:03:03 2003] : <B>(1) Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>"I wouldn't think."</font><br>
[Mon Jul 28 21:04:19 2003] : <B>(1) Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>If Renate were at home, Sabine would have recognized the set of her small frame immediately, as rather in need of a hug.</font><br>
[Mon Jul 28 21:04:37 2003] : <B>(1) Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>Renate, however, is scrupulously respectful of Godfrey's personal space.</font><br>
[Mon Jul 28 21:05:14 2003] : <B>(1) Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>So she only stands near the rail, drooping a bit as she watches the city they are approaching.</font><br>
[Mon Jul 28 21:09:41 2003] : <B>(2) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>Eridu is brown, yellow, sedimentary lines tufted with the green of gardens and tree-lined avenues.</font><br>
[Mon Jul 28 21:10:35 2003] : <B>(2) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>As the ship pulls into the docks, you become aware that it's a major trading area, even more than Ilium was; the entire docklands are a massive confusion of buying, selling, loading, unloading, auctioneering, and random yelling.</font><br>
[Mon Jul 28 21:11:22 2003] : <font color='#008000'>** (1) Renate can't find any questions to ask; the noise is a bit much for her. **</font><br>
[Mon Jul 28 21:11:31 2003] : <B>(1) Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>Even after Ilium.</font><br>
[Mon Jul 28 21:12:55 2003] : <B>(2) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>The captain has a lot of things to oversee; he sets a dinner date with you and Godfrey, then he's shipping back out the next morning.</font><br>
[Mon Jul 28 21:13:08 2003] : <font color='#008000'>** (1) Renate knows better than to get in his way. **</font><br>
[Mon Jul 28 21:13:17 2003] : <B>(1) Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>She accepts the dinner date with pleasure, and lets him go.</font><br>
[Mon Jul 28 21:13:31 2003] : <B>(2) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>And this leaves you at liberty in Eridu.</font><br>
[Mon Jul 28 21:13:52 2003] : <B>(1) Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>"Now. We're looking for a sort of temple, isn't that right?"</font><br>
[Mon Jul 28 21:13:57 2003] : <B>(2) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>A raggedly-dressed dwarf is selling city maps to anyone who'll buy; Godfrey picks one up.</font><br>
[Mon Jul 28 21:14:40 2003] : <B>(2) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>A quick bit of research shows that the Grand Temple of Whirlwind Lionheart is in the upper northern part of the city, in its largest level sector, along (quite appropriately) the Avenue of Gold.</font><br>
[Mon Jul 28 21:14:58 2003] : <B>(1) Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>"Shall we go take a look?"</font><br>
[Mon Jul 28 21:15:10 2003] : <B>(1) Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>"Can we drop the luggage somewhere?"</font><br>
[Mon Jul 28 21:17:59 2003] : <B>(2) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>"Let us check in at a hotel of some sort. The nearest one that looks suitable should suffice; Lord Darenton's gift may have to last us some time."</font><br>
[Mon Jul 28 21:18:10 2003] : <B>(1) Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>"All right."</font><br>
[Mon Jul 28 21:18:18 2003] : <font color='#008000'>** (1) Renate shoulders a hefty share of the baggage. **</font><br>
[Mon Jul 28 21:18:52 2003] : <B>(2) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>Porters&#8212;perhaps part of a guild, since they all wear a similar hat&#8212;offer to carry your luggage for you for a fee.</font><br>

[Mon Jul 28 21:19:50 2003] : <B>(2) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>Godfrey heads over to one of the elevators. "Captain Highwind alerted me to this particular stratagem," he mentions.

[Mon Jul 28 21:20:09 2003] : <B>(1) Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>"Got it." She follows him.</font><br>
[Mon Jul 28 21:20:20 2003] : <B>(2) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>Godfrey has to pay two chips to get you both on the elevators; apparently that is a more palatable expenditure.</font><br>
[Mon Jul 28 21:20:48 2003] : <B>(1) Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>"I don't mind doing my own lugging anyway. Or yours, for that matter."</font><br>
[Mon Jul 28 21:20:59 2003] : <B>(2) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>Godfrey has always seemed durable, but a long trip up a cliffside can't be a pleasant prospect for him.</font><br>
