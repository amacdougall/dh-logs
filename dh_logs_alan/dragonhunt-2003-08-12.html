[Tue Aug 12 23:51:55 2003] : <B>(2) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>"I have most fond recollections of the late-night theater revues in Ilium, my lady. As I recall, they are always full of energy, since the audiences largely comprise exuberant youths."</font><br>

[Tue Aug 12 23:52:40 2003] : <B>(1) Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>"And what did I tell you about what to call me?"</font><br>
[Tue Aug 12 23:52:44 2003] : <B>(2) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>"And from what I hear of Gereval's artistic counterculture, I suspect that you will find the political views evinced to be quite the opposite of Andragarian culture as you may have envisioned it."</font><br>

[Tue Aug 12 23:54:34 2003] : <B>(2) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>Will is pinching his temples between thumb and forefinger, a wry smile on his face. He seems to be enjoying the little verbal duel.</font><br>
