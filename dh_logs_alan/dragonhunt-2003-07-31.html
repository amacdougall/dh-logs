[Thu Jul 31 19:25:15 2003] : <B>(1) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>The fluid and musical syllables ring oddly in your ears, and the smell of the faerie incense, itself summoned from the far plane for this ritual, synaesthetically becomes its backbeat and counterpoint.</font><br>
[Thu Jul 31 19:26:25 2003] : <B>(1) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>You stand within an octagram poured from gold-laced sand; symbols entreating wealth, gain, loss, and craving adorn its edges like animals dancing along the course of a zodiac.</font><br>
[Thu Jul 31 19:27:12 2003] : <B>(1) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>As the ritual progresses, the grains of sand slowly shiver one by one, and then, like an atom changing state, snap into the color of gold.</font><br>

[Thu Jul 31 19:28:20 2003] : <B>(1) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>The elder priest has long bushy eyebrows, an elaborately embroidered green robe that is nearly solid gold with decoration, and a long golden staff, which he raps against different signs of the octogram according to the chant.</font><br>
[Thu Jul 31 19:28:51 2003] : <B>(1) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>You don't have to wait long; with no special crescendo or climax to the ceremony itself, the room slowly fills with Mist, until you are no longer able to see.</font><br>
[Thu Jul 31 19:29:20 2003] : <B>(1) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>Godfrey was forbidden to speak for fear of disrupting the ritual, but his eyes wish you good luck as the Mist rises to cover them.</font><br>

[Thu Jul 31 19:29:45 2003] : <font color='#008000'>** (2) Renate musters a faint smile for him. **</font><br>
[Thu Jul 31 19:29:55 2003] : <B>(1) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>And then you feel a faint breeze, just enough to make the mists swirl around you, and start to clear.</font><br>
[Thu Jul 31 19:30:13 2003] : <B>(1) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>You hear the lonely plaint of some far-off lake bird, echoing across water.</font><br>
[Thu Jul 31 19:30:35 2003] : <B>(1) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>You are on the shores of a lake; or at least, you think it is a lake, although you cannot see its surface for the dense mist that hangs over it.</font><br>
[Thu Jul 31 19:30:42 2003] : <B>(1) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>Far out in the middle is an island.</font><br>
[Thu Jul 31 19:30:59 2003] : <B>(1) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>A dark green-gray grass bends slickly beneath your feet.</font><br>

[Thu Jul 31 19:31:26 2003] : <B>(1) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>The grass feels real, springy, wet, alive.</font><br>
[Thu Jul 31 19:31:40 2003] : <B>(2) Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>She hopes it is not a genuine lake; she is not a good swimmer.</font><br>
[Thu Jul 31 19:31:47 2003] : <B>(1) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>Beneath it, the spongy earth feels just like the pond-side grounds of Karlbotel.</font><br>
[Thu Jul 31 19:32:09 2003] : <B>(2) Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>Well. If that is Forfeit Isle, that's where she has to go.</font><br>
[Thu Jul 31 19:32:48 2003] : <B>(2) Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>She stands up straight, squares hips and shoulders over her feet as if she were about to start a tumbling run, and walks toward the island.</font><br>
[Thu Jul 31 19:33:28 2003] : <B>(1) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>There is no water; simply mist, seemingly solid but completely insubstantial to the touch, rising to your knees, your hips, your neck.</font><br>
[Thu Jul 31 19:33:40 2003] : <B>(1) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>The ground rolls downward; but remains flat, grassy, easy to tread.</font><br>
[Thu Jul 31 19:33:57 2003] : <font color='#008000'>** (2) Renate tries to hold her course straight. **</font><br>
[Thu Jul 31 19:34:24 2003] : <B>(1) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>The mist closes over the top of your head; and all sound disappears with the dim light of the shrouded sun.</font><br>

[Thu Jul 31 19:34:46 2003] : <B>(1) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>Before you and behind and above is only gray, barely textured, and the steady tread of your own footsteps.</font><br>
[Thu Jul 31 19:34:48 2003] : <B>(2) Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>It is better to choose not to see than not to be able to.</font><br>
[Thu Jul 31 19:34:59 2003] : <B>(2) Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>Still, she keeps them open.</font><br>
[Thu Jul 31 19:35:01 2003] : <B>(1) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>You've fought blind; you know how to keep your bearings over at least a short distance.</font><br>
[Thu Jul 31 19:35:14 2003] : <B>(1) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>This skill comes into play as you put one foot in front of the other, again and again.</font><br>
[Thu Jul 31 19:35:37 2003] : <B>(2) Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>Fighting blind is as much fighting blindness as fighting one's opponent.</font><br>
[Thu Jul 31 19:35:57 2003] : <B>(1) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>And then, after what seems like at least a half hour, your bootheel clicks lightly on stone.</font><br>
[Thu Jul 31 19:36:26 2003] : <B>(1) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>A gust of wind tears the mists away; a flurry of spring rain comes with the blustering zephyr.</font><br>

[Thu Jul 31 19:36:46 2003] : <B>(1) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>You are standing on a flagstone; on the front steps of a building; in a city.</font><br>
[Thu Jul 31 19:37:05 2003] : <B>(1) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>A city, you immediately sense, greater than Ilium; greater, then, that anything you've seen before.</font><br>
[Thu Jul 31 19:37:42 2003] : <B>(1) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>The mists clear, and you can look more closely; buildings, their wood and stone dark with rain, rise four and five stories high here, and the broad streets are paved in flawless street-weave.</font><br>
[Thu Jul 31 19:37:53 2003] : <B>(1) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>There are no horses here, only rickshaws, pedestrians, such a flood!</font><br>

[Thu Jul 31 19:38:27 2003] : <B>(1) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>And even people riding bicycles&#8212;not the huge-wheels toys of the idle, but low, sleek vehicles designed for speed and convenience.</font><br>
[Thu Jul 31 19:38:54 2003] : <B>(1) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>You step further back into the entryway of the building as the rain picks up.</font><br>
[Thu Jul 31 19:39:03 2003] : <B>(2) Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>Are there signs anywhere? Anything to indicate what city this is?</font><br>
[Thu Jul 31 19:39:16 2003] : <B>(1) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>"Going to be quite a downpour when it <i>really</i> hits," says an elderly custodian who has just come out to sweep the steps.</font><br>

[Thu Jul 31 19:39:36 2003] : <B>(2) Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>"I should have dressed for it."</font><br>
[Thu Jul 31 19:39:40 2003] : <B>(1) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>"It'll be blowing in under this awning. But of course I'd better sweep anyway, or it'll all be mud."</font><br>

[Thu Jul 31 19:40:08 2003] : <B>(1) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>"Well, my nephew sells umbrellas at a stand just down the street. You won't miss him&#8212;his stand's under a great umbrella itself.</font><br>

[Thu Jul 31 19:40:20 2003] : <B>(2) Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>"Sensible. Thanks."</font><br>
[Thu Jul 31 19:40:25 2003] : <B>(2) Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>"Yes, I am."</font><br>
[Thu Jul 31 19:40:28 2003] : <B>(1) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>Your clothing is of a slightly different fashion than that which you see on the pedestrians.</font><br>
[Thu Jul 31 19:40:53 2003] : <B>(2) Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>Hm. Any clues in the clothing to where she might be?</font><br>
[Thu Jul 31 19:40:55 2003] : <B>(1) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>Their clothing is both elegant and practical, almost austere, compared to the more buoyant fashions of Ilium.</font><br>
[Thu Jul 31 19:41:23 2003] : <B>(1) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>You've read fashion magazines that come in with the month's mail&#8212;the new techniques of photography are just beginning to make their mark on the printing world.</font><br>
[Thu Jul 31 19:41:33 2003] : <B>(1) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>These are the fashions of Andragar.</font><br>

[Thu Jul 31 19:41:58 2003] : <B>(2) Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>Well. She needed to come here anyway.</font><br>
[Thu Jul 31 19:42:25 2003] : <B>(1) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>"Perhaps I could give you some directions?" the custodian asks, leaning on his broom.</font><br>

[Thu Jul 31 19:43:27 2003] : <B>(1) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>"Ah, the only soldiers you'll find in this part of the city wear the black and gold. And the lot of them will be at the Bernstein Memorial Arena."</font><br>

[Thu Jul 31 19:43:49 2003] : <B>(2) Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>"No, I didn't know. Are the tryouts public?"</font><br>
[Thu Jul 31 19:44:06 2003] : <B>(2) Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>(black and gold are Heaven's colors, I assume?)</font><br>
[Thu Jul 31 19:44:34 2003] : <B>(1) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>"Certainly. Standing practice. Of course, there are some as don't like to see it. It can get quite fatal."</font><br>
[Thu Jul 31 19:44:41 2003] : <B>(1) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>(Yes, and the colors of Andragar.)</font><br>
[Thu Jul 31 19:44:58 2003] : <B>(2) Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>"So I'm told. Thanks. You've been a great help."</font><br>
[Thu Jul 31 19:45:05 2003] : <B>(1) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>(When there are Andragar regulars, they wear all black; and the Dragoons wear white with black and gold bands.)</font><br>
[Thu Jul 31 19:45:23 2003] : <B>(2) Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>"I assume this crowd is mostly heading in that direction too?"</font><br>

[Thu Jul 31 19:46:28 2003] : <B>(1) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>"Aye, they don't get bigger than they do in Gereval. Rivalon, Ys, Xanadu, they're all close."</font><br>
[Thu Jul 31 19:46:44 2003] : <font color='#008000'>** (2) Renate resolutely heads off. **</font><br>
[Thu Jul 31 19:47:03 2003] : <B>(1) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>The city blocks are long; the caution about alleys was apt, since there are many of them, some almost streets.</font><br>
[Thu Jul 31 19:47:20 2003] : <B>(2) Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>If she has to backtrack once or twice, she'll be all right.</font><br>
[Thu Jul 31 19:47:27 2003] : <B>(1) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>But only the main streets have signs, large blue-painted signs with white lettering, which hang on long poles over each large intersection.</font><br>
[Thu Jul 31 19:47:47 2003] : <B>(1) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>Watch officers in little turrets direct traffic; otherwise, each one would be a tangle of collisions.</font><br>
[Thu Jul 31 19:48:09 2003] : <font color='#008000'>** (2) Renate shakes her head. How can Emil like this place? **</font><br>
[Thu Jul 31 19:48:31 2003] : <B>(1) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>The arena is easy to find; in fact, there is a sign at the intersection saying "Arena," with a helpful arrow.</font><br>
[Thu Jul 31 19:48:34 2003] : <B>(2) Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>Crowded, regimented, anonymous.</font><br>
[Thu Jul 31 19:48:57 2003] : <B>(2) Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>Well, let's go in, then.</font><br>
[Thu Jul 31 19:49:15 2003] : <B>(2) Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>Her being here on tryout day can hardly be coincidence.</font><br>
[Thu Jul 31 19:49:23 2003] : <B>(1) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>There are ticket gates, but they stand open at the moment; the attendants just nod amiably at those passing by.</font><br>
[Thu Jul 31 19:49:32 2003] : <B>(2) Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>If the ninety gold for the statue gains her her brother, it is worth every chip.</font><br>
[Thu Jul 31 19:49:43 2003] : <B>(1) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>The arena itself is long and square, apparently used for some field game as well as fighting.</font><br>
[Thu Jul 31 19:50:13 2003] : <B>(1) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>Burly guards direct the incoming crowd, which is now just a group of stragglers; most of those interested are already in the stands.</font><br>
[Thu Jul 31 19:50:26 2003] : <B>(2) Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>How full are the stands?</font><br>
[Thu Jul 31 19:50:32 2003] : <B>(2) Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>Can she get down front?</font><br>
[Thu Jul 31 19:50:33 2003] : <B>(1) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>There's quite a large crowd, suggesting that this event isn't just a boot camp yelling fest.</font><br>
[Thu Jul 31 19:50:56 2003] : <B>(1) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>There is standing room only down front, but it wouldn't be hard to get to a place near there, where you could still see.</font><br>
[Thu Jul 31 19:51:16 2003] : <B>(2) Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>Fair enough. She doesn't mind standing; she'll go.</font><br>
[Thu Jul 31 19:51:22 2003] : <B>(1) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>On the field itself, only a fairly small ring is laid out, looking lonely amid the abstract markings used for the arena's main game.</font><br>
[Thu Jul 31 19:53:53 2003] : <B>(1) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>Along one side of the ring, behind some sort of glass shield, are five wooden chairs, each occupied by a person in casual dress....</font><br>
[Thu Jul 31 19:54:03 2003] : <B>(1) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>...or what would be casual dress if it were not black and gold.</font><br>
[Thu Jul 31 19:54:14 2003] : <B>(1) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>The combination is not rare, especially in Andragar, but here it cannot be worn lightly.</font><br>
[Thu Jul 31 19:54:22 2003] : <B>(2) Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>She wouldn't think.</font><br>
[Thu Jul 31 19:54:29 2003] : <B>(1) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>And since there are three men and two women, it's clear who these five are.</font><br>
[Thu Jul 31 19:54:30 2003] : <B>(2) Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>Does any of them look like Shaleberg's statue?</font><br>
[Thu Jul 31 19:54:40 2003] : <B>(1) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>You're certain that if you could go down and see them face to face, one of them would.</font><br>
[Thu Jul 31 19:55:01 2003] : <B>(2) Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>Is there a hierarchy to their seating arrangement?</font><br>
[Thu Jul 31 19:55:09 2003] : <B>(2) Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>She wonders which one is Vinn.</font><br>
[Thu Jul 31 19:56:28 2003] : <B>(1) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>D&#237;an Dan Shi, the Mute Lord.</font><br>

[Thu Jul 31 19:57:20 2003] : <B>(2) Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>She turns toward the arena. Staring at Lune Knights can't be healthy.</font><br>
[Thu Jul 31 20:01:15 2003] : <B>(1) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>You're just in time. A man in full Heaven armor stands next to a gong made of brass, with one black stripe around its outside edge.</font><br>
[Thu Jul 31 20:01:25 2003] : <B>(1) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>He strikes the gong, and its reverberations quiet the crowd.</font><br>

[Thu Jul 31 20:02:08 2003] : <B>(1) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>There is no fanfare; a middle-aged man, slightly balding but slim, walks casually out of the contestants' entrance.</font><br>

[Thu Jul 31 20:16:40 2003] : <B>(1) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>He unsheathes the sword, letting the scabbard drop off in the other direction, and makes the symbol of Uriel in the air before assuming a fighting stance.</font><br>

[Thu Jul 31 20:16:56 2003] : <B>(1) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>The significance of the symbol is unclear; but if he has half a brain in his head, it's not meant for Vinn.</font><br>
[Thu Jul 31 20:17:22 2003] : <B>(1) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>Vinn takes the offensive this time, and immediately displays the upper hand.</font><br>
[Thu Jul 31 20:18:06 2003] : <B>(1) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>He disarms the young man with a rapid stroke, then knocks the blade into the air with his other sword, then forces James to scramble away from a series of blows timed, you realize, to give him just that chance.</font><br>
[Thu Jul 31 20:19:07 2003] : <B>(1) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>James recovers his sword, and waits more cautiously; but Vinn then attacks him with a double downward blow, a double upward blow, and an in-sweeping dashing attack that carries him past James to stop with his arms crossed over his chest, swords pointed in opposite directions like a pair of scissors that had cut right through their own axis.</font><br>
[Thu Jul 31 20:19:17 2003] : <font color='#008000'>** (2) Renate would have been tempted to try to kick Vinn's legs out from under him. **</font><br>

[Thu Jul 31 20:28:14 2003] : <B>(1) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>Emil does not use Wrenfall; instead, he uses the simple military style he learned with the Karlbotel militia.</font><br>

[Thu Jul 31 20:29:01 2003] : <B>(1) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>Vinn fights him on even terms; sword clacks on sword, the sound thin and cold in what is now a steady drizzle.</font><br>

[Thu Jul 31 20:30:39 2003] : <B>(1) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>When he does the same series of attacks that killed the previous contestant, Emil is ready for them; he holds his swords upward like a V and knocks them to either side, then swings down quickly to take advantage.</font><br>

[Thu Jul 31 20:31:40 2003] : <B>(1) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>Vinn is too quick for him, and as his swords fly wild he immediately brings them upwards in a double slash at Emil's ribs&#8212;</font><br>

[Thu Jul 31 20:33:39 2003] : <B>(1) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>Vinn's attack is Special; without moving his legs, Vinn cuts forward along the ground to seemingly slash all the way through his opponent.</font><br>
[Thu Jul 31 20:33:54 2003] : <B>(1) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>But Emil catches one of Vinn's feet and uses Vinn's own momentum to bring him down.</font><br>
