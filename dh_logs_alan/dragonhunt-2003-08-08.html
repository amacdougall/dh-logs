[Fri Aug 08 15:08:55 2003] : <B>(2) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>Perspective is strange here, and distance; your eyes are drawn to focus in odd directions, pulled from curiosity to curiosity.</font><br>

[Fri Aug 08 15:11:10 2003] : <B>(1) Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>The pit is all too tempting. She passes it by.</font><br>
[Fri Aug 08 15:11:30 2003] : <B>(2) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>As you enter the marketplace itself, the babble of a thousand imaginary languages fills your ears.

[Fri Aug 08 15:12:27 2003] : <B>(2) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>There are signs, and there are signs on top of signs; written in a confusion of languages, some glowing, some embossed, some actually adorned with living creatures yelling pitches.</font><br>

[Fri Aug 08 15:13:47 2003] : <B>(2) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>Once inside the market, it feels infinite; at each street crossing, there are exits in all eight directions and some straight up (knotted ropes hang from higher halls) and some straight down (a closed car descends an iron track straight down a tunnel.)</font><br>
[Fri Aug 08 15:14:00 2003] : <B>(2) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>There might be a "center," but you're not equipped to find it.</font><br>

[Fri Aug 08 15:15:33 2003] : <B>(2) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>The signs don't just advertise mundane goods; in addition to food, drink, clothing, luxuries, they offer such tantalizing wares as "memories forged," "dreams recovered," "cloth of diamond," "swords of truth."</font><br>
[Fri Aug 08 15:16:02 2003] : <B>(1) Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>No, no, no, and no.</font><br>
[Fri Aug 08 15:16:09 2003] : <B>(1) Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>She stops to ask someone.</font><br>
[Fri Aug 08 15:16:19 2003] : <B>(2) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>As you reach a T-junction, you meet the eye of a merchant... or what must be a merchant, as he sits behind the counter of a stall.</font><br>

[Fri Aug 08 15:17:23 2003] : <B>(1) Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>"I have, yes. Can you tell me where I might find Lord Whirlwind Lionheart?"</font><br>
[Fri Aug 08 15:18:18 2003] : <B>(2) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>"Whirlwind Lionheart keeps his secrets close; it would not do to send just any traveller his way."</font><br>
[Fri Aug 08 15:18:31 2003] : <B>(1) Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>"Well, I hope I am not just any traveller, then."</font><br>
[Fri Aug 08 15:19:11 2003] : <B>(2) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>The merchant holds out his hands; instead of hooves, he has tough articulated fingers.</font><br>
[Fri Aug 08 15:19:14 2003] : <B>(1) Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>She doesn't mean to be sharp; she's exhausted and confused and terribly afraid for Godfrey.</font><br>

[Fri Aug 08 15:19:38 2003] : <B>(1) Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>She takes off a wrist-brace and gives him her hand, palm-up.</font><br>
[Fri Aug 08 15:20:13 2003] : <B>(2) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>The merchant turns his head to focus one eye entirely on your palm; then snuffles gently at it with his nose, warm breath tickling.</font><br>

[Fri Aug 08 15:21:27 2003] : <B>(1) Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>"Is there no other bargain we can come to?"</font><br>
[Fri Aug 08 15:21:59 2003] : <B>(2) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>"Perhaps with another, you might. But I am a servant of the starry heaven, and only the celestial essence is of use to me."</font><br>
[Fri Aug 08 15:22:16 2003] : <B>(1) Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>"Then I am left with little choice but to find another guide."</font><br>
[Fri Aug 08 15:22:20 2003] : <B>(1) Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>She turns away.</font><br>
[Fri Aug 08 15:22:22 2003] : <B>(2) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>The stag tosses his head regretfully. "There are magpies here who might take some interest in your clinking silver."</font><br>

[Fri Aug 08 15:23:48 2003] : <B>(2) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>Down a transparent hall of blue ribbed crystal; through a forest of spreading trees whose fruits are singing birds; under a huge outcropping of roseate marble; you pass through the mysteries of Forfeit Isle as in a trance.</font><br>
[Fri Aug 08 15:24:30 2003] : <B>(2) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>Dozens of merchants recoil as you mention the Lord of Greed; or demand a piece of your soul or your memories or your determination.</font><br>
[Fri Aug 08 15:24:39 2003] : <B>(1) Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>Perhaps taking the stag too literally, Renate has her eyes on the heavens, looking for magpies.</font><br>
[Fri Aug 08 15:24:44 2003] : <B>(2) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>Here, it seems, the only prices are ones too steep to pay.</font><br>
[Fri Aug 08 15:24:48 2003] : <B>(1) Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>She refuses all of these.</font><br>
[Fri Aug 08 15:25:21 2003] : <B>(1) Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>If this is like Eridu, somewhere there will be someone mean and low enough to take the silver she can offer.</font><br>
[Fri Aug 08 15:25:25 2003] : <B>(2) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>But you realize, after a while, that you are being followed; and no sooner do you make that realization than the culprit steps out of the teeming crowd and bows drolly before you.</font><br>
[Fri Aug 08 15:25:57 2003] : <B>(2) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>A little fox, dressed in a waistcoat and top hat, standing on his hind feet, taps his cane gently on the ground.</font><br>

[Fri Aug 08 15:26:07 2003] : <B>(2) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>"So... looking for the master, I see."</font><br>
[Fri Aug 08 15:26:23 2003] : <B>(1) Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>"As it happens, yes. And I should like not to lose much more time."</font><br>
[Fri Aug 08 15:26:43 2003] : <B>(2) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>"Might I suggest that there are better things to buy in Forfeit Isle? For example, every time you've had something on the tip of your tongue and forgotten it... I could sell it all back to you."</font><br>
[Fri Aug 08 15:26:58 2003] : <B>(1) Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>"I only need to see Lord Lionheart."</font><br>
[Fri Aug 08 15:27:10 2003] : <font color='#008000'>** (1) Renate has said that until her tongue hurts at repeating it. **</font><br>
[Fri Aug 08 15:27:12 2003] : <B>(2) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>"Ah well then. A woman who knows just what she wants. Very rare here, very rare."</font><br>
[Fri Aug 08 15:27:39 2003] : <B>(2) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>"I shall shilly-shally no longer; perhaps a small gift might loosen my pointing finger?"</font><br>
[Fri Aug 08 15:28:02 2003] : <B>(2) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>"I gather that you have no urge to pay in the elevated currency we so treasure here."</font><br>
[Fri Aug 08 15:28:07 2003] : <font color='#008000'>** (1) Renate hands him a silver piece, careful not to let him see how much money she is carrying. **</font><br>
[Fri Aug 08 15:28:26 2003] : <font color='#008000'>** (1) Renate shakes her head silently. **</font><br>
[Fri Aug 08 15:28:53 2003] : <B>(2) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>The fox glances casually at the coin, then tosses it behind him, where it is caught by his pet (?), a bullfrog on a leash made of yellow yarn.</font><br>
[Fri Aug 08 15:29:18 2003] : <B>(2) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>"As you grow lower and lower on coin, that coin takes on greater and greater value."</font><br>
[Fri Aug 08 15:30:15 2003] : <B>(1) Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>"I have noticed," she says wryly.</font><br>
[Fri Aug 08 15:30:27 2003] : <B>(2) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>"I'm soft-hearted, what else can I say? The more you struggle, the more I'm inclined to give way."</font><br>
[Fri Aug 08 15:30:46 2003] : <font color='#008000'>** (1) Renate bows to him, not very low. **</font><br>
[Fri Aug 08 15:31:05 2003] : <B>(2) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>"We'll make it easy, and perhaps I can gain from this in the future... because in fact, the master sent me to look for you."</font><br>
[Fri Aug 08 15:31:16 2003] : <B>(2) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>"If you'd like to find Whirlwind Lionheart, just turn around."</font><br>
[Fri Aug 08 15:31:19 2003] : <B>(1) Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>"Did he, now?"</font><br>
[Fri Aug 08 15:31:24 2003] : <B>(1) Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>She does. Quickly.</font><br>
[Fri Aug 08 15:32:02 2003] : <B>(2) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>Behind you is a huge billboard, easily five stories tall and three blocks wide, which says <b>Whirlwind Lionheart, Inc</b> in huge Northrock lettering, lit up in golden fire.</font><br>
[Fri Aug 08 15:32:28 2003] : <B>(2) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>As you crane your head to read the massive letters, fireworks and spinner shoot out from it, going off like spellfire.</font><br>
[Fri Aug 08 15:32:38 2003] : <B>(1) Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>Saints and angels.</font><br>
[Fri Aug 08 15:32:41 2003] : <B>(1) Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>How did she miss this?</font><br>
[Fri Aug 08 15:32:44 2003] : <B>(1) Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>Was it even there?</font><br>
[Fri Aug 08 15:32:53 2003] : <B>(2) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>And directly before you, a human-sized door is built into the face of the billboard, at ground level.</font><br>

[Fri Aug 08 15:33:13 2003] : <B>(2) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>As you approach the door, you see that it has two signs on it.</font><br>
[Fri Aug 08 15:33:24 2003] : <B>(2) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>One, in copper plate, says "Whirlwind Lionheart is IN."</font><br>
[Fri Aug 08 15:33:35 2003] : <B>(2) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>The other, in brass plate, says, "Whirlwind Lionheart is OUT."</font><br>
[Fri Aug 08 15:33:50 2003] : <B>(2) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>Below them, someone has written in crayon "Whirlwind Lionheart is OUT TO LUNCH."</font><br>
[Fri Aug 08 15:34:01 2003] : <B>(1) Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>(*LOL*)</font><br>
[Fri Aug 08 15:34:13 2003] : <B>(1) Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>"We'll see," she says, and turns the doorknob.</font><br>
[Fri Aug 08 15:34:14 2003] : <B>(2) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>(It's an old joke, but I keep re-using it.)</font><br>
[Fri Aug 08 15:35:25 2003] : <B>(2) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>You step through the doorway into a long shop... <i>very</i> long, so long that aisles and aisles of shelves recede into grayness, and the very curvature of the earth comes into play to push the far end of the room over the horizon.</font><br>
[Fri Aug 08 15:35:37 2003] : <B>(1) Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>Oh. Oh, well.</font><br>
[Fri Aug 08 15:35:48 2003] : <B>(1) Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>She starts walking again.</font><br>
[Fri Aug 08 15:36:47 2003] : <B>(2) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>Each shelf holds treasures of simply astonishing value; art so beautiful it's all you can do to walk past it without a second glance, jewelry made of giant gemstones, magical weapons glowing with arcane light.</font><br>
[Fri Aug 08 15:37:18 2003] : <B>(1) Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>None of it matters, save for a loyal friend, and -- secondarily -- an heirloom bow.</font><br>
[Fri Aug 08 15:37:24 2003] : <B>(2) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>If every shelf holds treasures as valuable as those you glimpse as you pass by, then Whirlwind Lionheart's collection could be used to buy the entire world a million times over.</font><br>
[Fri Aug 08 15:37:44 2003] : <B>(1) Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>But not, perhaps, some of the people in it.</font><br>
[Fri Aug 08 15:38:05 2003] : <B>(2) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>But it's only a few steps before you're at the other end of the shop, standing before a long sanded wooden counter, face to face with a kindly old shopkeep.</font><br>
