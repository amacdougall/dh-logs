[Tue Jul 15 19:39:56 2003] : <B>(2) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>The kingdom of Vesper is small; barely even a province.</font><br>
[Tue Jul 15 19:40:08 2003] : <B>(2) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>It looks very like Karlbotel: thatched houses, outlying farms, a ruler's mansion.</font><br>

[Tue Jul 15 19:40:55 2003] : <B>(2) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>On your way to Vesper, you passed through a number of less peaceful kingdoms, but even when you had to ride wide around active battlefields, you saw farmers and townspeople going about their daily business.</font><br>
[Tue Jul 15 19:41:19 2003] : <B>(2) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>Godfrey's planning kept you free of the most lawless areas; and at mercenary checkpoints, your family name was sufficient to ensure you safe passage.</font><br>
[Tue Jul 15 19:41:27 2003] : <font color='#008000'>** (1) Renate has been a remarkably unsatisfying travelling companion. **</font><br>
[Tue Jul 15 19:41:48 2003] : <B>(2) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>Ilium is fully paid with all the mercenary guilds, shielding its citizens from pillage.</font><br>
[Tue Jul 15 19:42:21 2003] : <B>(2) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>Even the common folk seem to feel no fear in the Patchworks, though; only, if anything, a tired resolution.</font><br>
[Tue Jul 15 19:42:47 2003] : <B>(2) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>War has been a fact of life here for so long that even when stray dragon breath sets cornfields alight, the people simply gather together, put out the fire, and keep on living.</font><br>
[Tue Jul 15 19:43:10 2003] : <B>(2) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>In some kingdoms, however, peace rules for more than a few weeks at a time&#8212;Vesper is one of them.</font><br>
[Tue Jul 15 19:43:17 2003] : <font color='#008000'>** (1) Renate could probably learn something from that, if it were pointed out to her. **</font><br>
[Tue Jul 15 19:44:19 2003] : <B>(2) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>Godfrey has suggested that you keep your eyes open and your ears attentive; but seems to believe, as he always does, that personal experience is the best teacher.</font><br>
[Tue Jul 15 19:44:26 2003] : <B>(2) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>The capital city, as Godfrey has explained, is named Larkspur, and it's really not much more than a town.</font><br>
[Tue Jul 15 19:44:54 2003] : <B>(2) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>It's larger than the county seat of Karlbotel, however&#8212;since it's on the intersection of trade routes, there are more inns, packed with more travellers and merchants.</font><br>
[Tue Jul 15 19:45:39 2003] : <B>(2) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>In fact, there appears to be a bit of a holiday in progress; as you near the town's edge, and the dirt road turns to cobbles, you see banners and vendors' carts lining the street.</font><br>

[Tue Jul 15 19:48:08 2003] : <B>(2) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>"Ah, quite right," he says, seeing something of interest.</font><br>
[Tue Jul 15 19:48:29 2003] : <B>(1) Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>"Oh, good," says Renate, not sure what's right about it.</font><br>
[Tue Jul 15 19:48:34 2003] : <B>(2) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>"The Deadly Fighting has reached to Vesper. Unsurprising, as Hyuri is a master of human-form swordsmanship."</font><br>

[Tue Jul 15 19:48:52 2003] : <B>(1) Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>"Really? If you were a dragon, why would you bother?"</font><br>
[Tue Jul 15 19:49:55 2003] : <B>(2) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>It advertises a "Grande Battel off Tremendous Proportiones!" between "the Titan of Tongfers, Katsuro Yabuki" and "Fearsome Ruler of the Four Seasons, Hyuri of Larkspur!!!"</font><br>
[Tue Jul 15 19:50:22 2003] : <B>(2) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>Godfrey explains, "It is simply a hobby, much like building a ship in a bottle."</font><br>
[Tue Jul 15 19:50:39 2003] : <font color='#008000'>** (1) Renate checks the poster for a date. **</font><br>
[Tue Jul 15 19:50:40 2003] : <B>(2) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>"One could build a model ship far more easily without the glassy impediment, but the challenge then is not so great."</font><br>

[Tue Jul 15 19:50:56 2003] : <B>(1) Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>"Weird hobby."</font><br>
[Tue Jul 15 19:51:01 2003] : <B>(2) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>(Right back, water's boiling.)</font><br>
[Tue Jul 15 19:51:19 2003] : <B>(2) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>"Very many dragons study mortal swordsmanship, usually so that they can instruct their own armies."</font><br>

[Tue Jul 15 19:51:59 2003] : <B>(1) Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>"You'd think they could hire the best."</font><br>
[Tue Jul 15 19:54:15 2003] : <B>(2) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>"Most dragons prefer to govern claws-on, as it were."</font><br>
[Tue Jul 15 19:54:30 2003] : <B>(2) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>Godfrey often makes jokes like that, but never by word or expression admits that they're meant to be funny.</font><br>
[Tue Jul 15 19:54:37 2003] : <B>(1) Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>"Oh. How about Hyuri?"</font><br>
[Tue Jul 15 19:54:56 2003] : <font color='#008000'>** (1) Renate is too glum to pay much attention to jokes at present. **</font><br>
[Tue Jul 15 19:55:26 2003] : <B>(2) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>"He's sharply xenophobic. He hates to deal with anyone but his closest advisors. Fighting is his only commerce with the outside world."</font><br>
[Tue Jul 15 19:55:50 2003] : <B>(1) Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>"Oh. Um. So how do we find out where our things are?"</font><br>
[Tue Jul 15 19:56:01 2003] : <B>(2) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>"In fact, we're blessed that a fight is due. I suspect that he would be more difficult to contact without the duel to lure him outside his manor."</font><br>

[Tue Jul 15 19:57:18 2003] : <font color='#008000'>** (1) Renate doesn't really care. **</font><br>
[Tue Jul 15 19:57:51 2003] : <B>(2) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>"Then, we should each seek information in our own way; were you to muster a more personable front, you might easily find loose tongues amongst the young nobles who are here for the fight."</font><br>

[Tue Jul 15 19:58:36 2003] : <B>(2) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>A stableboy rushes out to take your horses; Godfrey flips him a copper, which the boy accepts with amazement.</font><br>

[Tue Jul 15 19:59:04 2003] : <B>(1) Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>"I see that."</font><br>
[Tue Jul 15 19:59:15 2003] : <B>(2) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>"What might cost a copper in Karlbotel town should cost no more than five chips here."</font><br>

[Tue Jul 15 19:59:51 2003] : <B>(1) Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>"Seems to me it ought to be all the same."</font><br>
[Tue Jul 15 20:04:37 2003] : <B>(2) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>"In a world of absolute justice, no doubt it would," Godfrey says, using a conversational gambit as old as your first "but why?"</font><br>
[Tue Jul 15 20:05:17 2003] : <B>(2) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>The Water Lily's common room is fairly crowded; there are a lot of people in foreign-looking clothes, seemingly from all nations.</font><br>
[Tue Jul 15 20:05:21 2003] : <B>(1) Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>"None of that around," Renate says sadly.</font><br>
[Tue Jul 15 20:05:47 2003] : <B>(2) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>The inn's proprietress, a big motherly woman with tall hair and an operatic voice, hollers, "Helloooo, loves, step on in and welcome to the Water Lily!"</font><br>
[Tue Jul 15 20:05:59 2003] : <B>(1) Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>"Thank you, ma'am."</font><br>
[Tue Jul 15 20:06:17 2003] : <B>(2) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>Even your traveling clothes betray an aristocratic cut, so several people look at you curiously, and talk to each other quietly.</font><br>

[Tue Jul 15 20:06:58 2003] : <B>(2) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>The woman steps out from behind the bar and curtsies ponderously. "Why certainly, young mistress! We'll prepare our best room, we will, only five copper a night and a free mint on your pillow!"</font><br>
[Tue Jul 15 20:07:00 2003] : <font color='#008000'>** (1) Renate keeps an eye out for trouble. **</font><br>
[Tue Jul 15 20:07:15 2003] : <B>(2) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>Godfrey nods to your very faintly in assent.</font><br>
[Tue Jul 15 20:07:26 2003] : <B>(1) Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>"We won't trouble you for your best, ma'am. But thank you, and we accept."</font><br>
[Tue Jul 15 20:07:31 2003] : <B>(2) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>"The crowding suggests that prices will be high," he murmurs.</font><br>
[Tue Jul 15 20:07:51 2003] : <B>(2) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>"My name's Elistrata," she says, "and if you need anything at all, I'm the one you ask for!"</font><br>
[Tue Jul 15 20:07:54 2003] : <B>(1) Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>"We're lucky we're getting anything," she whispers back.</font><br>
[Tue Jul 15 20:08:05 2003] : <B>(2) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>"Let me serve you up a bowl of chowder, you must be hungry from the road!"</font><br>
[Tue Jul 15 20:08:15 2003] : <B>(2) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>"And perhaps a glass of wine or a mug of ale to wash away the dust?"</font><br>
[Tue Jul 15 20:08:17 2003] : <B>(1) Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>"Could we wash up first, ma'am?"</font><br>
[Tue Jul 15 20:08:29 2003] : <B>(2) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>"But of course, dear! Let me show you your accomodations!"</font><br>
[Tue Jul 15 20:08:41 2003] : <B>(2) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>She bustles upstairs, snapping for a busboy to carry your luggage.</font><br>
[Tue Jul 15 20:08:51 2003] : <font color='#008000'>** (1) Renate is reminded of one of her teachers by Elistrata. **</font><br>
[Tue Jul 15 20:09:04 2003] : <font color='#008000'>** (1) Renate follows. **</font><br>
[Tue Jul 15 20:09:16 2003] : <B>(2) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>Apparently the busboy's heard from the stableboy, because he hastens to pick everything up into a staggering load.</font><br>
[Tue Jul 15 20:09:58 2003] : <B>(2) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>The rooms are simple but satisfactory. There's a wash-basin, soft beds, clothing racks, some overstuffed furniture.</font><br>
[Tue Jul 15 20:10:08 2003] : <B>(2) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>You're left wondering where the bathroom is, though.</font><br>
[Tue Jul 15 20:10:23 2003] : <font color='#008000'>** (1) Renate looks around vaguely. **</font><br>
[Tue Jul 15 20:10:35 2003] : <B>(1) Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>Doubtless Godfrey will figure it out.</font><br>
[Tue Jul 15 20:10:51 2003] : <B>(2) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>Godfrey lifts the covers of one bed to reveal a covered basin. "No finer accomodations in the Patchworks, I shouldn't wonder," he says abstractedly.</font><br>
[Tue Jul 15 20:11:16 2003] : <B>(1) Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>"Oh. Oh, well."</font><br>
[Tue Jul 15 20:11:16 2003] : <B>(2) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>"Not anywhere," Elistrata says, busily fluffing pillows and checking that the pitcher by the wash basin is full.</font><br>
[Tue Jul 15 20:11:34 2003] : <B>(2) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>"When you're ready for bed, just tell me and I'll have a pot of coals brought up to warm the covers!"</font><br>

[Tue Jul 15 20:12:15 2003] : <B>(2) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>"Ah, you'd be from the north, then? Certainly a mild spring here by comparison!"</font><br>
[Tue Jul 15 20:12:41 2003] : <B>(1) Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>"I've come a long way, ma'am," Renate says, not caring to disclose her origins.</font><br>
[Tue Jul 15 20:12:42 2003] : <B>(2) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>Over the days of your journey, the last snows have melted, and it is indeed not very cold.</font><br>
[Tue Jul 15 20:13:26 2003] : <B>(2) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>Godfrey tips the busboy a handful of chips, and he and Elistrata bow their way out.</font><br>

[Tue Jul 15 20:14:50 2003] : <B>(1) Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>"If I get into the luggage for some clothes I'll mess everything up. Would you mind finding me something I can wear tonight?"</font><br>
[Tue Jul 15 20:15:20 2003] : <B>(2) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>"Of course," he says, and begins the magical process of removing your clothes from their arcane folds.</font><br>
[Tue Jul 15 20:15:57 2003] : <B>(2) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>You've heard that magic can be contained even in the pattern of a woven vine; you've heard tales that the samurai lord deLeon makes spells from knotted silk ribbon.</font><br>
[Tue Jul 15 20:16:07 2003] : <B>(2) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>You wouldn't be surprised if Godfrey does the same when folding clothes.</font><br>
