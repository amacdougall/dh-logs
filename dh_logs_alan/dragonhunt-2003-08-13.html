[Wed Aug 13 00:06:27 2003] : <B>(1) Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>"All right, then. This is the last sight of you I get for a while, I guess, so I'd better make the most of it."</font><br>
[Wed Aug 13 00:06:53 2003] : <B>(1) Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>"Sorry I'm such a downer, though. It really *has* been a terrible trip."</font><br>
