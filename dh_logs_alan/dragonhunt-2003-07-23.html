[Wed Jul 23 21:10:19 2003] : <B>(2) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>It doesn't take long to realize that the music is actually working a subtle magic on you, much like Mistress Durai's must.</font><br>
[Wed Jul 23 21:10:44 2003] : <B>(2) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>But this music is soothing and enlivening, bringing a sense of well-being. Quite a different phenomenon.</font><br>

[Wed Jul 23 21:19:11 2003] : <B>(2) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>Sylvie smiles, and though the expression is cold, it is the cold of a perfect snowfield in moonlight.</font><br>
