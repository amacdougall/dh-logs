[Wed Jul 16 19:42:58 2003] : <B>(1) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>"Yes, right. Well... after working his mischief in the Summer style, he'll switch to Fall, whose moves are powerful attacks meant to damage the opponent as much as possible."</font><br>

[Wed Jul 16 19:44:50 2003] : <B>(1) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>"That's how I lost. I saw him switch out of Fall, and I thought I was out of the woods, but when I did my strongest move, he punished me."</font><br>

[Wed Jul 16 21:21:27 2003] : <B>(3) Emilia Eaglebourne</B>: <font color='#000080'>Clearly banter is part of the meal, and Emilia is willing to forget her troubles for a bit.</font><br>

[Wed Jul 16 21:32:08 2003] : <B>(1) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>It's not quite as hot as he warned; just a pleasant sting atop a complex and stirring flavor.</font><br>

[Wed Jul 16 21:42:35 2003] : <B>(1) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>Arronax chows down on his food with gusto and no little lip-smacking. Despite his title, he doesn't appear to have had a completely gentlemanly upbringing.</font><br>
[Wed Jul 16 21:42:43 2003] : <B>(1) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>Or at least, he acts the gentleman only in certain aspects.</font><br>
