[Tue Dec 16 20:37:03 2003] : <B>(5) The Voice</B>: <font color='#000080'>Skvarce, Sk'snThe only K'siri Arc Knight in history. The "serpent angel" of South Lan'yarian myth, Sk'sn only came to Andragar at the age of 46, relentlessly tracking one of his oldest enemies. Although completely lost in Northrock culture, he managed to learn the language and conventions well enough to complete his taskbut not well enough to explain that the man he'd killed was a fugitive murderer. The Erethan police intended to detain him until a K'siri interpreter could be found, but Sk'sn broke out of prison and fled across the countryside. The matter was referred to the capital, and Lachlan Vinn sent the 3rd Platoon after the renegade K'siri. After a long chase, they managed to trap him against Andragar's southern shore, about fifteen miles east of Southpoint. Although they took him back to Gereval in chains, those chains were quickly removed once they learned his true identity. In compensation for his hardship, Lachlan Vinn offered him the position of Arc Knight, which he accepted. The wandering lifestyle of an Arc Knight has been quite comfortable for Sk'sn Skvarce, and his typical heroism has done much to improve the general view of the K'siri in Northrock.</font><br>

[Tue Dec 16 20:39:37 2003] : <B>(1) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>The fight is pretty much over once he and the Cloudgatherers show up... the ghosts and werewolves clear out the rest of the zombies, and Old Wolf and Barracuda Jones prevent Agrippa from escaping.</font><br>
[Tue Dec 16 20:39:51 2003] : <B>(1) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>Once he's caught in Jone's net and looking down one of Old Wolf's arrows, he surrenders.</font><br>
[Tue Dec 16 20:40:29 2003] : <B>(1) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>Keph LoCaine, like the bastard he is, goes invisible, and Sabra goes kiting after him by sound.</font><br>
[Tue Dec 16 20:40:50 2003] : <B>(1) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>If Dorothea were here, we'd play it out; but as is, I'm going to do a mental coin toss and say that he gets away.</font><br>
[Tue Dec 16 20:41:15 2003] : <B>(1) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>The last thing she hears of him is "Note to self: Kill everyone in Heaven."</font><br>
[Tue Dec 16 20:41:38 2003] : <B>(9) Rien</B>: <font color='#804000'>(I despise people who say 'note to self')</font><br>
[Tue Dec 16 20:41:41 2003] : <B>(1) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>Sabra shares this tidbit as a laugh line, but Skvarce isn't amused. "I shall passs word of this new threatener to my comradesss...."</font><br>
[Tue Dec 16 20:42:20 2003] : <B>(1) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>"Even I musst respect his powerss, and many of my friendsss might be overwhelmed by him if taken alone."</font><br>
[Tue Dec 16 20:42:39 2003] : <B>(3) Aryk</B>: <font color='#000080'>"Sabra, it's useless.  Let the asshole go."  Aryk walks up to Skvarce.  "Umm.. sorry about that freak show comment, Mr. Arc Knight sir."</font><br>
[Tue Dec 16 20:42:44 2003] : <B>(1) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>He moves and speaks with a hypnotic lazy rhythm; but you've seen how he can explode into speed like a cottonmouth.</font><br>
[Tue Dec 16 20:43:08 2003] : <B>(1) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>"Nay, Sssquire, I have a... ssense of humor, we shall say."</font><br>
[Tue Dec 16 20:43:25 2003] : <B>(1) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>"Thosse who find me amusing are most preferred to those who find me fearssome."</font><br>
[Tue Dec 16 20:44:00 2003] : <B>(1) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>His tongue flicks out, tasting the air, and a nictitating membrane comes up over his eyes in what might be a K'siri smile.</font><br>
[Tue Dec 16 20:44:23 2003] : <B>(3) Aryk</B>: <font color='#000080'>"Well, I wasn't... er... speaking of you specifically.... you know, with all the ghosts and were.. WHOA!"  </font><br>
[Tue Dec 16 20:44:28 2003] : <B>(1) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>"I admire your bravenesss in sstanding against the Necromancer guild secretary...."</font><br>
[Tue Dec 16 20:45:02 2003] : <B>(3) Aryk</B>: <font color='#000080'>"Well, most would say it's stupidity, but anyway, Sabra told me too."</font><br>
[Tue Dec 16 20:45:03 2003] : <B>(1) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>Near the entrance, Agrippa (now in manacles) is having a shouting match with another man in nearly-identical black robes.</font><br>
[Tue Dec 16 20:45:17 2003] : <B>(1) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>This other man is quite human, though, and shows all the signs; he's fat, old, bearded.</font><br>
[Tue Dec 16 20:45:23 2003] : <B>(1) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>Presumably the Dark Professor.</font><br>
[Tue Dec 16 20:45:31 2003] : <B>(3) Aryk</B>: <font color='#000080'>Aryk listens in.</font><br>
[Tue Dec 16 20:46:10 2003] : <B>(1) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>"Rail all you want, Agrippa, you won't convince Noble Mercury that you were enforcing a 'protected guild action' against me. Your zombies destroyed private property and endangered civilians."</font><br>
[Tue Dec 16 20:46:33 2003] : <B>(1) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>"For which the Guild shall pay an indemnity! But <i>you</i> shall be found guilty of conspiring against dragon Edict!"</font><br>
[Tue Dec 16 20:46:54 2003] : <B>(3) Aryk</B>: <font color='#000080'>"Ha-ha!"</font><br>
[Tue Dec 16 20:47:04 2003] : <B>(1) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>"Your penalty shall be death&#8212;and no eternal life shall come after it, you who scorn the true path"</font><br>
[Tue Dec 16 20:47:36 2003] : <B>(1) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>"Your 'true path' is idiocy, Agrippa. But why rehash that old argument? We've both published a dozen articles in guild journals from here to Karth."</font><br>
[Tue Dec 16 20:48:10 2003] : <B>(1) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>"The Church will back me, and Uriel willing, we'll purge you and your Bone Phoenix madmen from our Guild!"</font><br>
[Tue Dec 16 20:48:52 2003] : <B>(1) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>Sabra whispers in your ear, "He's actually talking about seceding from dragon rulership of the guild. Professor Aurashin wants the protection of the Church for his intellectual freedom."</font><br>
[Tue Dec 16 20:49:05 2003] : <B>(1) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>"It's a complex political issue. Old Wolf filled me in a little."</font><br>
[Tue Dec 16 20:50:07 2003] : <B>(1) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>Old Wolf finishs gagging Agrippa, and walks over to you. "Sir Lazarus, Agent Congreve, Sir Jitsuryoku, Brother Deacon..."</font><br>
[Tue Dec 16 20:50:24 2003] : <B>(1) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>"Let me introduce Maltavan San-Kane Aurashin, whose werewolves fought so bravely today."</font><br>
[Tue Dec 16 20:50:28 2003] : <B>(3) Aryk</B>: <font color='#000080'>Aryk stands at attention.</font><br>
[Tue Dec 16 20:50:46 2003] : <B>(1) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>"A pleasure," the professor says, bowing. "And to you, Arc Knight, greetings as well."</font><br>
[Tue Dec 16 20:50:57 2003] : <B>(3) Aryk</B>: <font color='#000080'>"Um... a pleasure, my Dark Professor Aurashin sir."</font><br>
[Tue Dec 16 20:51:16 2003] : <B>(1) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>The police have finally arrived, and they're carting away zombie parts (for crimelab analysis) and Agrippa himself.</font><br>
[Tue Dec 16 20:51:37 2003] : <B>(1) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>"I witnessed some of your struggle with Agrippa, Lazarus. A brave battle."</font><br>
[Tue Dec 16 20:52:12 2003] : <B>(3) Aryk</B>: <font color='#000080'>"Not really, I'd have gotten toasted.  But uh, that's never stopped me before."</font><br>
[Tue Dec 16 20:52:16 2003] : <B>(1) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>"I'll be testifying against my guild-brother in court, I fear... I tested a few of his zombie corpses, and find that they are too recent to have come from legal sources."</font><br>
[Tue Dec 16 20:52:55 2003] : <B>(3) Aryk</B>: <font color='#000080'>"You mean, there's like... legal places to raise the dead?"</font><br>
[Tue Dec 16 20:52:56 2003] : <B>(1) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>"If he raised zombies from protected graveyards, he could be sentenced to death... and not the death he so fervently craves."</font><br>
[Tue Dec 16 20:53:28 2003] : <B>(1) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>"Oh, heavens yes! The remains of battles more than a hundred years past, among other things. Quite acceptable under law."</font><br>
[Tue Dec 16 20:53:59 2003] : <B>(1) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>"Of course, I do not condone the practice. This is yet another element of our little schism."</font><br>
[Tue Dec 16 20:54:46 2003] : <B>(1) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>"I choose to use my study of the ... macabre... to benefit those who need it. Werewolves, ghosts, vampires, intelligent zombies and ghouls... they have all learned to come to me, or else I go to them."</font><br>

[Tue Dec 16 20:55:08 2003] : <B>(1) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>"Yes, it honestly appears that he was... an unholy pact with Agrippa, no doubt."</font><br>
[Tue Dec 16 20:55:31 2003] : <B>(3) Aryk</B>: <font color='#000080'>"That's just wierd."</font><br>
[Tue Dec 16 20:55:37 2003] : <B>(1) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>Old Wolf says, "I recognize him. I've fought him once before. He's wanted for a dozen murders. He'll hang for certain once they resurrect him and try him."</font><br>
[Tue Dec 16 20:56:03 2003] : <B>(3) Aryk</B>: <font color='#000080'>Aryk ponders the irony.</font><br>
