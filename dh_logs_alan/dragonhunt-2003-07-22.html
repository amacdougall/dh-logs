[Tue Jul 22 22:21:10 2003] : <B>(2) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>The dwarf exits the square to the north, and stops a block later in front of a four-story building built, like the guardhouse in Angelwatch, after the model of a fortress.</font><br>
[Tue Jul 22 22:21:31 2003] : <B>(1) Emilia</B>: <font color='#000080'>"Here we are, I think. Will you come with me, or wait here, Godfrey?"</font><br>
[Tue Jul 22 22:21:35 2003] : <B>(2) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>The walls actually lean outwards a little, as though the architect had been told to make the most looming, imposing testament to the power of law.</font><br>

[Tue Jul 22 22:22:39 2003] : <B>(2) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>Three sets of double doors lead into a large lobby area. There are three lines, each leading to a different open spot at the counter.</font><br>
[Tue Jul 22 22:23:15 2003] : <B>(2) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>One of the open stations has a sign saying "fines and tickets," but the other two seem general-purpose.</font><br>
[Tue Jul 22 22:23:37 2003] : <B>(1) Emilia</B>: <font color='#000080'>One of those seems appropriate. The shorter line, preferably.</font><br>
[Tue Jul 22 22:23:43 2003] : <B>(2) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>Godfrey points out a lockbox with a thin slot on top, and a sign saying "tips&#8212;anonymity guaranteed."</font><br>

[Tue Jul 22 22:25:14 2003] : <B>(1) Emilia</B>: <font color='#000080'>"I have concerns surrounding the upcoming Dorothy Durai concert."</font><br>

[Tue Jul 22 22:26:45 2003] : <B>(2) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>"So, what, she's a murderer?"</font><br>
[Tue Jul 22 22:27:02 2003] : <B>(1) Emilia</B>: <font color='#000080'>"No. But the kind of music she plays seems to incite crimes of jealousy."</font><br>
[Tue Jul 22 22:27:24 2003] : <B>(2) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>"So, wait, she plays some music, people get sad, they kill each other."</font><br>
[Tue Jul 22 22:27:28 2003] : <B>(1) Emilia</B>: <font color='#000080'>"I am only saying it cannot hurt to be careful."</font><br>

[Tue Jul 22 22:33:05 2003] : <B>(2) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>"My friend lives in the Salla District, just north of Kamry Park. It's not very far."</font><br>

[Tue Jul 22 22:33:41 2003] : <B>(2) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>Another fifteen minutes' rickshaw ride takes you to the address Godfrey specifies.</font><br>
[Tue Jul 22 22:34:03 2003] : <font color='#008000'>** (1) Emilia puts her mannerly face on. **</font><br>
[Tue Jul 22 22:34:18 2003] : <B>(1) Emilia</B>: <font color='#000080'>Despite an uncomfortable awareness that she has not changed out of her travelling garb.</font><br>
[Tue Jul 22 22:34:29 2003] : <B>(2) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>The area is very pleasant indeed; the streets are paved in overlapping bricks with a herring-bone pattern, and every house is two stories, with a beautiful lawn.</font><br>
[Tue Jul 22 22:34:50 2003] : <B>(2) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>Godfrey tells the dwarf to return in two hours.</font><br>
[Tue Jul 22 22:34:59 2003] : <B>(2) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>(Or to send someone else, at least.)</font><br>
[Tue Jul 22 22:35:33 2003] : <B>(2) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>"Baron Darenton is a pleasant old fellow. He will not comment in the slightest on any informality we might commit."</font><br>
[Tue Jul 22 22:35:57 2003] : <B>(2) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>"Even his title is simply a relic of earlier days. His family holds wealth, but no political power."</font><br>
[Tue Jul 22 22:36:01 2003] : <B>(1) Emilia</B>: <font color='#000080'>"Well, I shall endeavor not to commit any," Emilia says in a fair imitation of her manservant.</font><br>
[Tue Jul 22 22:36:21 2003] : <B>(2) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>"He is now a patron of the arts, and is lord only over that domain." As Godfrey speaks, you walk up a gentle rise to the door.</font><br>
[Tue Jul 22 22:37:06 2003] : <B>(2) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>Godfrey pulls down on a bellpull. This action winds a clockwork somewhere out of sight, and as the clockwork spins and the bellpull slowly retracts to its original position, chimes play a merry tune.</font><br>
[Tue Jul 22 22:37:30 2003] : <B>(1) Emilia</B>: <font color='#000080'>How utterly useless, Emilia cannot help thinking.</font><br>
[Tue Jul 22 22:38:01 2003] : <B>(2) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>A few moments later, a formally-dressed doorman opens the wooden door. His face is as expressionless as Godfrey's; it is possible that were they to touch, they would both explode.</font><br>
[Tue Jul 22 22:38:11 2003] : <B>(1) Emilia</B>: <font color='#000080'>(ha!)</font><br>
[Tue Jul 22 22:38:12 2003] : <B>(2) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>He holds out a silver tray. "Sir?"</font><br>
[Tue Jul 22 22:38:25 2003] : <B>(2) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>Godfrey places a calling card on the tray, face down. "Sir."</font><br>
[Tue Jul 22 22:38:44 2003] : <B>(2) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>The doorman backs into the house. "Please, come into the foyer."</font><br>
[Tue Jul 22 22:39:05 2003] : <B>(2) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>As you step over the threshold, you see the doorman retreating down a hall.</font><br>
[Tue Jul 22 22:39:34 2003] : <B>(1) Emilia</B>: <font color='#000080'>"If that said 'Eaglebourne' anywhere on it, I am going to roast you over a slow fire, Godfrey. Just so you know," Emilia murmurs.</font><br>
[Tue Jul 22 22:39:40 2003] : <B>(2) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>The foyer is in two parts; the entrance is floored in marble, and contains a hatrack, umbrella rack, and boot caddy.</font><br>
[Tue Jul 22 22:39:50 2003] : <B>(2) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>"It is my own calling card from my earlier days, my lady."</font><br>

[Tue Jul 22 22:40:02 2003] : <B>(2) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>There is a step up, and the floor is carpeted from then on.</font><br>
[Tue Jul 22 22:40:11 2003] : <B>(2) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>Godfrey removes his boots, then steps up onto the carpeted area.</font><br>
[Tue Jul 22 22:40:23 2003] : <font color='#008000'>** (1) Emilia follows suit. **</font><br>
[Tue Jul 22 22:40:41 2003] : <B>(2) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>The carpet is deep and luxurious, and stretches from wall to wall, cut to fit the shape of the floor.</font><br>
[Tue Jul 22 22:40:51 2003] : <B>(2) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>You've only seen thin rectangular carpets before this.</font><br>
[Tue Jul 22 22:41:17 2003] : <B>(2) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>Every fixture and fitting of the house is of the highest quality you've ever seen; although smaller, this place makes the manor house of Karlbotel look rustic.</font><br>
[Tue Jul 22 22:41:23 2003] : <B>(1) Emilia</B>: <font color='#000080'>"Goodness. I'll sink in and never come out."</font><br>
[Tue Jul 22 22:41:42 2003] : <B>(1) Emilia</B>: <font color='#000080'>"Worse than quicksand."</font><br>
[Tue Jul 22 22:41:44 2003] : <B>(2) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>Beautiful paintings and sculptures adorn the rooms, although this at least is not surprising, given the buildup.</font><br>
[Tue Jul 22 22:42:02 2003] : <B>(1) Emilia</B>: <font color='#000080'>(sure, Godfrey said this guy was an arts patron.)</font><br>
[Tue Jul 22 22:42:17 2003] : <B>(2) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>The doorman returns. "The Baron will see you, and furthermore wishes me to extend his highest esteem in advance of your meeting."</font><br>

[Tue Jul 22 22:42:47 2003] : <font color='#008000'>** (1) Emilia dutifully follows him. **</font><br>
[Tue Jul 22 22:42:50 2003] : <B>(2) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>The doorman leads you down a hall to a light-filled sitting room. Two men rise as you enter.</font><br>
[Tue Jul 22 22:43:19 2003] : <B>(2) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>One is elderly, at least to your youthful eyes, and is dressed in a formal suit with what looks like a silk nightrobe tossed over it.</font><br>
[Tue Jul 22 22:43:44 2003] : <B>(2) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>The other is younger but still mature, of fine feature, with platinum blonde hair that pours down his back.</font><br>
[Tue Jul 22 22:44:11 2003] : <B>(2) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>"Godfrey," they both cry at about the same time. Godfrey embraces both men heartily, then turns to you.</font><br>
[Tue Jul 22 22:44:13 2003] : <font color='#008000'>** (1) Emilia enters and curtsies properly to both men. **</font><br>
[Tue Jul 22 22:44:38 2003] : <B>(2) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>"Lady Renate, may I introduce Baron Kligh Darenton and Jashain Juste?"</font><br>

[Tue Jul 22 22:45:46 2003] : <B>(2) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>"And you must address me as Jashain, as well," says the younger man, bowing with a flourish.</font><br>

[Tue Jul 22 22:46:09 2003] : <B>(1) Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>"Certainly, under the same condition."</font><br>
[Tue Jul 22 22:46:11 2003] : <B>(2) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>"May I bring you refreshment?" asks the doorman.</font><br>
[Tue Jul 22 22:46:59 2003] : <B>(1) Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>"That would be welcome."</font><br>
[Tue Jul 22 22:46:59 2003] : <B>(2) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>"Have you any Sequoia Hills?" asks Godfrey. "It's been so long that I would very nearly kill for a glass. Or at the very least, speak crossly."</font><br>
[Tue Jul 22 22:47:16 2003] : <B>(2) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>Kligh laughs. "I can barely imagine you doing even that, Godfrey!"</font><br>
[Tue Jul 22 22:47:33 2003] : <B>(1) Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>"Out of the question, I assure you," Renate grins.</font><br>
[Tue Jul 22 22:47:36 2003] : <B>(2) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>"We have a fresh bottle, Master Cuyler," says the doorman.</font><br>

[Tue Jul 22 22:51:13 2003] : <B>(2) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>Godfrey nods. "We swung wide around the worst of it. Our journey was without incident," he adds blandly.</font><br>

[Tue Jul 22 22:51:24 2003] : <B>(2) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>(And comparatively speaking, it was.)</font><br>

[Tue Jul 22 22:51:59 2003] : <B>(2) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>Jashain leans in as well, signalling his interest.</font><br>
[Tue Jul 22 22:52:38 2003] : <B>(2) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>Godfrey clears his throat. "Well, our first order of business is to find a young lady named Dorothy Durai. She carries an item which was stolen from my lady's family years ago."</font><br>

[Tue Jul 22 22:55:12 2003] : <B>(2) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>"So how can I help you?" asks Kligh. "Aside from replenishing your travelling funds, of course. I know you like to travel light on gold, so that trip through the Patchworks might have emptied your purse."</font><br>
[Tue Jul 22 22:55:12 2003] : <B>(1) Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>The gentlemen see a faint disquiet pass over her face.</font><br>
[Tue Jul 22 22:55:57 2003] : <B>(2) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>"Well," Godfrey says, "I accept that offer with great appreciation. And in fact, your donation will not simply contribute to our life of dissolution," he adds drily.</font><br>

[Tue Jul 22 23:05:01 2003] : <B>(2) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>One is a dark ensemble complete with broad shoulderplates and a flowing cloak; almost vampiric, with metal accents and high boots.</font><br>
[Tue Jul 22 23:05:41 2003] : <B>(1) Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>"Not bad. Lose the shoulders and the metal, try some embroidery in a subtle shade -- I like it."</font><br>
[Tue Jul 22 23:05:48 2003] : <B>(2) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>One is a white suit, almost clerical, with straight lines and a high collar, and a silvery breastplate in several pieces to flex around the outfit.</font><br>
[Tue Jul 22 23:06:14 2003] : <B>(2) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>Its outer coat hangs straight and dignified, but allows freedom of motion and hidden weapons.</font><br>

[Tue Jul 22 23:07:17 2003] : <B>(2) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>"That one is more of a ring costume. Not necessarily suited for general wear," Jashain laughs.</font><br>

[Tue Jul 22 23:10:42 2003] : <B>(1) Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>"And isn't that a bit much for a concert?"</font><br>
[Tue Jul 22 23:10:56 2003] : <B>(2) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>The final sketch is a classic duelist's garb, with tight black trousers, an embroidered three-quarter coat with gold piping, a broad-brimmed black hat with a golden feather, and a light gilt breastplate.</font><br>
[Tue Jul 22 23:11:10 2003] : <B>(2) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>The epaulettes, although they dangle braid, are actually cunningly design armor plates.</font><br>

[Tue Jul 22 23:12:31 2003] : <B>(2) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>"Well, in the original design the golden breastplate was meant to preserve the black and gold color scheme. You know, to highly Ariane's citizenship."</font><br>
