[Fri Oct  7 19:36:16 2005] : <B>(3) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>Perhaps it's a minor example of suffering for the sake of beauty, but red spots on her cheeks, ears, and nose did give her a scrubbed and elfin look.</font><br>

[Fri Oct  7 19:38:49 2005] : <B>(3) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>Mia takes the clothes up to the store clerk. The total is only a couple of silver for the clothing, plus two more silver for the leather coat.</font><br>

[Fri Oct  7 22:56:36 2005] : <B>(3) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>I told him "dude, you just stood there taunting him after the third party called the start of the duel. You KNEW he was doing something. I even acted out the motions."</font><br>
[Fri Oct  7 22:56:46 2005] : <B>(3) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>He said, "Yeah. I sort of deserved that death."</font><br>
[Fri Oct  7 22:57:24 2005] : <B>(3) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>Well, in the previous campaign, deLeon and the samurai only came into play twice. Once, they were hired by the Sages' Republic for a battle.</font><br>
[Fri Oct  7 22:57:33 2005] : <B>(3) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>Once, they were hired by Dark Eternal.</font><br>
[Fri Oct  7 22:57:41 2005] : <B>(2) Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>Ah. Yeah. That would do it.</font><br>
[Fri Oct  7 22:57:51 2005] : <B>(3) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>The heroes, as in this campaign, had the option of hiring him themselves, and didn't.</font><br>
[Fri Oct  7 22:57:59 2005] : <B>(2) Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>Could they have afforded him?</font><br>
[Fri Oct  7 22:58:17 2005] : <B>(2) Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>He doesn't come cheap.</font><br>
[Fri Oct  7 22:58:21 2005] : <B>(3) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>Yes, because if you recall, Kodaku chose to take control of the Patchwork Kingdoms with the help of Genjiro Hideki.</font><br>
[Fri Oct  7 22:58:29 2005] : <B>(2) Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>Except with cat-girls.</font><br>
[Fri Oct  7 22:58:38 2005] : <B>(2) Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>Heh. Hold that thought. *grin*</font><br>
[Fri Oct  7 22:58:49 2005] : <B>(2) Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>I have plans in the direction of the Patchworks. I just haven't articulated them yet.</font><br>
[Fri Oct  7 22:58:55 2005] : <B>(3) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>I'm sure Flehr Trabohn would have been able to squeeze some money out of all those kingdoms by liquidating treasuries of greedy kings and so forth.</font><br>
[Fri Oct  7 22:59:05 2005] : <B>(3) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>Flehr being the Godfrey-equivalent.</font><br>
[Fri Oct  7 22:59:16 2005] : <B>(2) Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>Yep. I have some Godfrey fluff in the works.</font><br>
[Fri Oct  7 22:59:30 2005] : <B>(3) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>Definitely a mind for how much wealth it is appropriate to have, and how much would be more useful in a practical application.</font><br>
[Fri Oct  7 22:59:30 2005] : <B>(2) Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>Because I just had to imitate that one P.G. Wodehouse story told from Jeeves's point of view.</font><br>
[Fri Oct  7 22:59:37 2005] : <B>(3) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>i.e. hiring muscle as needed.</font><br>
[Fri Oct  7 22:59:40 2005] : <B>(2) Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>yep</font><br>
[Fri Oct  7 22:59:57 2005] : <B>(3) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>Well-founded in Wodehouse, if you ever read "Jeeves Makes an Omelet."</font><br>
[Fri Oct  7 23:00:11 2005] : <B>(3) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>It involves him knocking Bertie senseless with his cane.</font><br>
[Fri Oct  7 23:00:23 2005] : <B>(2) Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>yep, I believe that's the one</font><br>
[Fri Oct  7 23:00:27 2005] : <B>(3) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>I can't remember why, but it was to get Bertie out of some scrape or other.</font><br>
[Fri Oct  7 23:00:32 2005] : <B>(2) Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>yep</font><br>
[Fri Oct  7 23:00:36 2005] : <B>(3) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>That and the time he fights off an enraged goose with an umbrella.</font><br>
[Fri Oct  7 23:00:44 2005] : <B>(2) Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>well, yes, but Bertie narrates that one</font><br>
[Fri Oct  7 23:01:15 2005] : <B>(3) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>Oh, I was referring back to Godfrey's understanding of the necessity of hired goons.</font><br>
[Fri Oct  7 23:01:20 2005] : <B>(2) Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>ah, gotcha</font><br>
[Fri Oct  7 23:02:17 2005] : <B>(2) Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>what I'm discovering in the course of writing is that Godfrey, while very Jeeveslike, is better-motivated and less shallow than Jeeves.</font><br>
[Fri Oct  7 23:02:36 2005] : <B>(2) Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>"better-motivated" in the sense of "wtf is Jeeves doing nursemaiding Bertie Wooster anyway?"</font><br>
[Fri Oct  7 23:03:07 2005] : <B>(2) Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>Godfrey at least has a goal in mind, for which sake he endures Renate.</font><br>
[Fri Oct  7 23:03:37 2005] : <B>(3) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>Endures? Better to say cultivates.</font><br>
[Fri Oct  7 23:03:53 2005] : <B>(2) Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>Well, yes. I dipped into Renate's point of view there. :)</font><br>
[Fri Oct  7 23:04:29 2005] : <B>(2) Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>I'll have to try to finish that up. It spills a lot of useful dirt about Renate's future plans.</font><br>
[Fri Oct  7 23:04:40 2005] : <B>(2) Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>Including what she has in mind for the Patchworks.</font><br>
[Fri Oct  7 23:05:46 2005] : <B>(2) Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>And it'll drop a hint about something Mia might tackle, down the road a stretch.</font><br>
[Fri Oct  7 23:06:16 2005] : <B>(3) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>Philosophical question of the day: Can God microwave a burrito until it's so hot he himself cannot eat it?</font><br>
[Fri Oct  7 23:06:34 2005] : <B>(2) Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>Just a variation on the usual rock.</font><br>
[Fri Oct  7 23:07:00 2005] : <B>(2) Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>Omnipotence is a chimera.</font><br>
[Fri Oct  7 23:07:09 2005] : <B>(2) Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>Which is, perhaps, our only hope against Dark Eternal.</font><br>
[Fri Oct  7 23:08:29 2005] : <B>(1) Rien</B>: <font color='#004040'>why would god want to Microwave it?  he could just put in in a fusion chamber or something</font><br>
[Fri Oct  7 23:08:49 2005] : <B>(3) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>I think Adrian has a more relevant and nuanced approach to the question.</font><br>
[Fri Oct  7 23:09:16 2005] : <B>(1) Rien</B>: <font color='#004040'>I do?</font><br>
[Fri Oct  7 23:09:22 2005] : <B>(2) Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>apparently so</font><br>
[Fri Oct  7 23:09:28 2005] : <B>(1) Rien</B>: <font color='#004040'>I thought I was making a rather patheitc attempt at starting a joke, but okay</font><br>
[Fri Oct  7 23:09:55 2005] : <B>(1) Rien</B>: <font color='#004040'>I can handle being relevant and nuanced for once in my life</font><br>
[Fri Oct  7 23:10:28 2005] : <B>(2) Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>I believe what Alan may be saying is "don't meet DE head on; head him off, or give him something he wants more than he wants the Silver Coast."</font><br>
[Fri Oct  7 23:10:29 2005] : <B>(3) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>Well, it's the joke aspect I was drawing attention to.</font><br>
[Fri Oct  7 23:10:35 2005] : <B>(2) Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>heh</font><br>
[Fri Oct  7 23:10:39 2005] : <B>(2) Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>sorry</font><br>
[Fri Oct  7 23:11:01 2005] : <B>(3) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>You know, any number of approaches to Dark Eternal would be valid and possibly effective.</font><br>
[Fri Oct  7 23:11:23 2005] : <B>(2) Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>today's joke for me was watching the back driveway flood at work... somebody for who-knows-what reason decided to float a toy boat in it</font><br>
[Fri Oct  7 23:11:26 2005] : <B>(1) Rien</B>: <font color='#004040'>so, basically... Dark Eternal's in the background, causing shit, as always, because that's what he does, trying to stir people up against him, heating things... but then he suddenly finds that those he's been turning against each other unite against him, and become a force that even his scaly white ass can't deal with.</font><br>
[Fri Oct  7 23:11:39 2005] : <B>(2) Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>Nah. I got something better than that.</font><br>
[Fri Oct  7 23:11:41 2005] : <B>(3) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>Cooperation with Soleil. Opposition to Soleil. Rapprochement between Rien and him. Cooperation with Dark Eternal as he presents further challenges to Rien.</font><br>
[Fri Oct  7 23:12:14 2005] : <B>(2) Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>Well, we'll have to take it one challenge at a time.</font><br>
[Fri Oct  7 23:12:38 2005] : <B>(2) Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>But Renate does have ideas, which she will communicate to Godfrey if I ever finish that fluff.</font><br>
[Fri Oct  7 23:13:05 2005] : <B>(1) Rien</B>: <font color='#004040'>and then there was that idea that you hatched at me recently, D</font><br>
[Fri Oct  7 23:13:13 2005] : <B>(2) Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>oh, *that* idea</font><br>
[Fri Oct  7 23:13:19 2005] : <B>(2) Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>don't you go communicating that one to Alan</font><br>
[Fri Oct  7 23:13:23 2005] : <B>(2) Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>it's *really* mean</font><br>
[Fri Oct  7 23:14:24 2005] : <B>(2) Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>it's not just twisting the knife</font><br>
[Fri Oct  7 23:14:36 2005] : <B>(3) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>Fine by me... most characters can be confounded by the right circumstances.</font><br>
[Fri Oct  7 23:14:38 2005] : <B>(2) Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>it's putting the knife on a goddamn eggbeater before you stick it in</font><br>
[Fri Oct  7 23:14:57 2005] : <B>(3) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>Dark Eternal can't, because as I've said, the only way to GM superintelligence is to secretly retcon things.</font><br>
[Fri Oct  7 23:15:03 2005] : <B>(3) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>It's very cheap, but necessary.</font><br>
[Fri Oct  7 23:15:14 2005] : <B>(2) Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>so that we always have a Big Bad?</font><br>
[Fri Oct  7 23:15:37 2005] : <B>(1) Rien</B>: <font color='#004040'>gotta have something ot move towards</font><br>
[Fri Oct  7 23:15:40 2005] : <B>(3) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>Well, because Dark Eternal's set up as non-outwittable. Or very nearly so.</font><br>
[Fri Oct  7 23:16:01 2005] : <B>(1) Rien</B>: <font color='#004040'>Hmmm... we never did the recent dinner-and-dancing scene, did we?</font><br>
[Fri Oct  7 23:16:01 2005] : <B>(2) Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>Heh. That validates Renate's approach, actually.</font><br>
[Fri Oct  7 23:16:05 2005] : <B>(2) Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>no, we didn't</font><br>
[Fri Oct  7 23:16:13 2005] : <B>(2) Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>if you want to fluff it sometime, Adrian, I'm up for that</font><br>
[Fri Oct  7 23:16:14 2005] : <B>(3) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>A sufficiently distributed and clever attempt on (insert objective) would work.</font><br>
[Fri Oct  7 23:16:21 2005] : <B>(1) Rien</B>: <font color='#004040'>as for the old dancing one... did we do that in a session or in fluff?</font><br>
[Fri Oct  7 23:16:26 2005] : <B>(2) Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>a session</font><br>
[Fri Oct  7 23:16:47 2005] : <B>(1) Rien</B>: <font color='#004040'>aaah... that would explain why I can't find it in my email</font><br>
[Fri Oct  7 23:16:56 2005] : <B>(2) Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>right, I still need to email you logs</font><br>
