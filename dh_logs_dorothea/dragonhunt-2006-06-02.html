[Fri Jun  2 19:06:41 2006] : <B>(3) Rien</B>: <font color='#004000'>S'okay.  I think we can handle that.</font><br>
[Fri Jun  2 19:06:57 2006] : <B>(1) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>What's the plan for today? Loose ends in Ilium and its surroundings, or over to Valin?</font><br>

[Fri Jun  2 19:07:22 2006] : <B>(2) Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>And then I guess we go where Kurtzveil's taking us.</font><br>
[Fri Jun  2 19:08:14 2006] : <B>(1) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>Without Aryk to provide commentary?</font><br>
[Fri Jun  2 19:08:40 2006] : <B>(1) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>I don't know that he's essential to the events, mind you.</font><br>
[Fri Jun  2 19:09:03 2006] : <B>(1) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>We can definitely continue the main storyline with his temporary absence.</font><br>
[Fri Jun  2 19:09:05 2006] : <B>(2) Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>Renate's going back to tell Aryk they're going to see Soleil. We are definitely all going to the meeting together.</font><br>

[Fri Jun  2 19:10:19 2006] : <B>(2) Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>Not to my knowledge, but maybe you know better than I do. Try calling him?</font><br>
[Fri Jun  2 19:10:23 2006] : <B>(1) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>My wedding invitation says Friday, June 9th for the wedding, so I won't be attending the Dragonhunt either.</font><br>

[Fri Jun  2 19:10:29 2006] : <B>(1) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>Yeah, I'll ring him up.</font><br>
[Fri Jun  2 19:11:22 2006] : <B>(1) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>Okay, he'll be here shortly, he says.</font><br>
[Fri Jun  2 19:11:45 2006] : <B>(1) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>So Rien and/or Renate can go talk to Colette now.</font><br>
[Fri Jun  2 19:11:47 2006] : <B>(3) Rien</B>: <font color='#004000'>Yea, verily.</font><br>
[Fri Jun  2 19:12:37 2006] : <B>(3) Rien</B>: <font color='#004000'>Rien would prefer if Renate came with him, although would also completely understand if she didn't want to.  He'd leave her with Aryk, because he's lsightly worried if he leaves her alone she'll come down with a bad case of Vanishing Without A Trace</font><br>
[Fri Jun  2 19:12:38 2006] : <B>(2) Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>Rien's up, then.</font><br>
[Fri Jun  2 19:13:04 2006] : <B>(2) Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>She isn't keen on seeing Colette. Too much fuss.</font><br>
[Fri Jun  2 19:13:54 2006] : <B>(1) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>Quite so. All right...</font><br>

[Fri Jun  2 19:14:35 2006] : <B>(1) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>The address Wren gave is a nondescript building on the Avenue of Querents, one of those featureless grayish boxes that may at one point in architectural history have been considered "modern."</font><br>
[Fri Jun  2 19:15:12 2006] : <B>(1) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>They appeal to businesses with boring work; and to businesses who benefit from a boring facade.</font><br>
[Fri Jun  2 19:16:06 2006] : <B>(1) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>This one barely even has a company nameplate near the door; there is only a small brass placard labeled "Conrad, Ltd."</font><br>
[Fri Jun  2 19:17:40 2006] : <font color='#008000'>** (3) Rien looks up at the facade, trying to picture bright Collette working in a place like this, and shrugs, knocking on the door." **</font><br>
[Fri Jun  2 19:18:09 2006] : <B>(1) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>The door is windowless and closed; a bit of painted-over brasswork shows where a bellpull was removed at one point.</font><br>
[Fri Jun  2 19:19:14 2006] : <B>(1) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>There is no response to Rien's first or second knocks; but just as he begins to think there will not be an answer, the door opens slightly and a wizened old man peers out suspiciously.</font><br>
[Fri Jun  2 19:19:39 2006] : <font color='#008000'>** (3) Rien peers back in amiably **</font><br>
[Fri Jun  2 19:20:15 2006] : <B>(1) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>He appears ready to drive away salesmen or evangelists, but judges Rien's appearance worthy of marginally more polite conversation. "Yes?"</font><br>

[Fri Jun  2 19:22:15 2006] : <B>(1) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>(No problem!)</font><br>
[Fri Jun  2 19:22:49 2006] : <B>(1) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>The man frowns, and his bushy eyebrows and bald pate make him look almost like some incredulous owl. "Oh really?"</font><br>
[Fri Jun  2 19:23:14 2006] : <B>(1) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>"What gives you the idea there is anyone by that name here?"</font><br>
[Fri Jun  2 19:23:47 2006] : <B>(3) Rien</B>: <font color='#004000'>"Because I was given her address by Wren."</font><br>
[Fri Jun  2 19:24:11 2006] : <B>(1) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>(The owl in question is an internet meme: <a href="http://www.orlyowl.com/">I could not resist.</a>)</font><br>
[Fri Jun  2 19:25:15 2006] : <B>(1) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>"Wren, eh... fair enough. Fair enough. Come in, before anyone sees you," he says, eyeing a completely empty street.</font><br>
[Fri Jun  2 19:26:09 2006] : <B>(3) Rien</B>: <font color='#004000'>"Certainly.  I will do this as soon as you actually open the door wide enough."</font><br>
[Fri Jun  2 19:26:11 2006] : <B>(1) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>The inside of the building is just as boring as its outside; beige walls, uneven gray carpet, battered desks.</font><br>
[Fri Jun  2 19:26:36 2006] : <B>(1) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>"Yes, yes... yes," he says, jerking on the door to unstick it. "We don't come in this way much."</font><br>
[Fri Jun  2 19:27:41 2006] : <B>(1) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>"Don't be expecting anything too fancy... we just have a minor laboratory, nothing serious. The majority of the work here is research."</font><br>
[Fri Jun  2 19:27:59 2006] : <B>(1) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>"Have you heard of Ghidrall's Compensation?"</font><br>
[Fri Jun  2 19:28:20 2006] : <B>(1) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>(Rien has not; but then, there are thousands if not millions of spells and items with obscure names like that.)</font><br>
[Fri Jun  2 19:28:55 2006] : <B>(3) Rien</B>: <font color='#004000'>"I believe so.  Under about five different names.  One of the problems with magical research is coming up with something truly unique."</font><br>
[Fri Jun  2 19:29:21 2006] : <B>(1) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>The old man leads Rien to a stairwell, and where the stairwell ends in a dingy basement, he rounds the banister again and walks into what should be an angular little cubbyhole. Instead, he disappears from view.</font><br>
[Fri Jun  2 19:30:10 2006] : <B>(1) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>Attempting to follow him, Rien is confronted with solid stone and plaster.</font><br>
[Fri Jun  2 19:30:22 2006] : <B>(1) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>"Come on, just disbelieve it," the old man snaps from somewhere beyond the wall.</font><br>
[Fri Jun  2 19:31:05 2006] : <font color='#008000'>** (3) Rien shrugs, closes his eyes and steps through.  He's seen stranger things in his life. **</font><br>
[Fri Jun  2 19:31:52 2006] : <B>(1) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>It's a very well-crafted illusion; even Rien bumps his head a few times before mustering the willpower to believe that he is, in fact, facing blank air.</font><br>
[Fri Jun  2 19:32:55 2006] : <B>(1) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>"Good, good," the man says as Rien steps through. "Not long now. This is the workplace." He leads Rien down a long sloping hall which ends at a large ironbound wooden door more appropriate to a dungeon than a laboratory.</font><br>
[Fri Jun  2 19:34:13 2006] : <B>(1) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>He pushes on it and it opens with a dramatic creak. The laboratory itself is just as dramatic and picturesque as the door; long tables are cluttered with disorganized stacks of notes and diagrams and books, and complex alchemical and arcane apparatus are mounted on pedestals.</font><br>
[Fri Jun  2 19:34:14 2006] : <B>(3) Rien</B>: <font color='#004000'>(Do the outsides of the walls happened to be butressed?)</font><br>
[Fri Jun  2 19:34:43 2006] : <B>(1) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>(You're underground at this point; the building on the surface seems to have been simply a front.)</font><br>
[Fri Jun  2 19:35:33 2006] : <B>(3) Rien</B>: <font color='#004000'>(Rule one of scientific research into unknown realms: Be prepared for things to go boom.)</font><br>
[Fri Jun  2 19:37:18 2006] : <B>(1) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>Colette Dupre is sitting at a workbench in a far corner of the room, hunched over something clamped in a structure of delicate gimballed armatures; it looks like a piece of jewelry. Strong light bathes her workspace and sends rainbow glints around the room.</font><br>
[Fri Jun  2 19:38:20 2006] : <B>(1) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>She looks up, calmly. Her hair is pulled back with a simple ribbon, instead of her usual arrangement of butterfly-wing hairpins.</font><br>
[Fri Jun  2 19:38:49 2006] : <B>(1) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>"Master Rien," she says without preamble, "come take a look at this."</font><br>
[Fri Jun  2 19:41:28 2006] : <B>(1) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>(Or not!)</font><br>
[Fri Jun  2 19:41:45 2006] : <B>(2) Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>(Adrian's been laggy. Maybe he's fallen off the 'net.)</font><br>
[Fri Jun  2 19:41:51 2006] : <B>(1) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>(I'm going to bet parents.)</font><br>
[Fri Jun  2 19:42:02 2006] : <B>(1) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>Log off for a few. How you been?</font><br>
[Fri Jun  2 19:42:50 2006] : <B>(3) Rien</B>: <font color='#004000'>Betting parents would be a good bet.  It almost always is.</font><br>
[Fri Jun  2 19:43:20 2006] : <B>(1) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>Well, I took the opportunity to microwave some coffee, so gimme 60 seconds.</font><br>

[Fri Jun  2 19:45:56 2006] : <B>(4) Aryk</B>: <font color='#000080'>Good man.  Getting down to the wire with this wedding-business, though.  A week from today!</font><br>
[Fri Jun  2 19:46:05 2006] : <B>(3) Rien</B>: <font color='#004000'>So I heard.</font><br>
[Fri Jun  2 19:46:41 2006] : <B>(2) Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>I admit that one of the things keeping my marriage together during its bad patch last year was the horrible thought of maybe having to throw another goddamn wedding.</font><br>
[Fri Jun  2 19:46:42 2006] : <B>(4) Aryk</B>: <font color='#000080'>I'm really psyched.  In fact, I wish this week would just hurry up and get over with so we can get to the actual ceremony.</font><br>
[Fri Jun  2 19:47:04 2006] : <B>(4) Aryk</B>: <font color='#000080'>Heh heh, that does make sense.</font><br>
[Fri Jun  2 19:47:17 2006] : <B>(1) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>Once you've gone to all that trouble, it would be a shame to start over.</font><br>
[Fri Jun  2 19:47:24 2006] : <B>(2) Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>exactly</font><br>
[Fri Jun  2 19:47:47 2006] : <B>(4) Aryk</B>: <font color='#000080'>I agree.  And I'm sure Jenny could concure wholeheartedly, since she's tackling a large majority of this business herself.</font><br>

[Fri Jun  2 21:38:12 2006] : <B>(7) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>Colette staggers out of the portal and blinks a few times, regaining her bearings. "That's something."</font><br>

[Fri Jun  2 21:40:16 2006] : <B>(7) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>Kurtzveil appears last, and the gate collapses behind him. "This is as close I could come without causing problems. We will walk the rest of the way."</font><br>

[Fri Jun  2 21:40:53 2006] : <B>(7) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>"You'll find out that a lot of what we do is really low-tech," Colette says, stepping out along the path and beckoning for you to follow.</font><br>
[Fri Jun  2 21:41:19 2006] : <B>(8) Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>"That must annoy you considerably."</font><br>
[Fri Jun  2 21:41:22 2006] : <B>(7) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>"Big flagrant displays of magic get a bit too visible. So far this place has been kept secret with nothing but passive defenses."</font><br>
[Fri Jun  2 21:41:30 2006] : <B>(7) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>"Passive but formidable," Kurtzveil amends.</font><br>
[Fri Jun  2 21:43:07 2006] : <B>(7) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>Colette says, "Sometimes the least advanced technology takes the most thought. Did you know that the dark elves erected the Archon Temple before they even had the wheel?"</font><br>
[Fri Jun  2 21:44:26 2006] : <B>(7) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>"They could do some of it with telekinesis," she explains, "but most of it was just this really weird collection of levers and ramps and shims."</font><br>
[Fri Jun  2 21:44:49 2006] : <B>(8) Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>"Technology feeds on itself," Renate says. "My politics teacher told me once to go out in the yard and make a tool, with nothing but my bare hands. You'd be surprised how hard it was."</font><br>
[Fri Jun  2 21:45:43 2006] : <B>(9) Aryk</B>: <font color='#000080'>Aryk takes in his surroundings.  "...Is this Lanyaria?  It must be.  Those mountains over there look just like the ones from that painting on the wall in El Cerdo Grande Restaurante in Illium."</font><br>
[Fri Jun  2 21:46:36 2006] : <B>(7) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>"Yes..." the mountain air is thin and cool; Colette's breath crystallizes as she walks. But it is not the biting and bitter cold the season demands.</font><br>
[Fri Jun  2 21:46:46 2006] : <B>(8) Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>"I finally came up with a rather sad excuse for a fishing pole, but it took me most of the day. I think it was an excuse to get me out of my mama's hair, truthfully."</font><br>
[Fri Jun  2 21:47:15 2006] : <B>(7) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>"This part of the mountains is not where it seems to be," Kurtzveil explains. "Powerful spirits of the earth play deep games with geography to shield Soleil."</font><br>
[Fri Jun  2 21:48:09 2006] : <B>(7) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>Colette says, "Everything we do is an extension of what came before us, of course. But that means tragedies of the past can lead to worse in the future, too."</font><br>
[Fri Jun  2 21:49:06 2006] : <B>(7) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>"And sometimes... there just isn't a good choice. You know as well as I do that Soleil won't be a flawless angel with a plan as pure as algebra."</font><br>
[Fri Jun  2 21:49:19 2006] : <B>(9) Aryk</B>: <font color='#000080'>Aryk doesn't quite comprehend, so he decides to comment, "You never need an excuse to go fishing.  ...Right bro?"</font><br>
[Fri Jun  2 21:49:22 2006] : <B>(8) Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>"Colette, dear heart," Renate chides. "The propaganda does not help your cause. Let it be, until everyone can speak freely, hm?"</font><br>
[Fri Jun  2 21:49:46 2006] : <B>(7) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>Colette turns forward again as she enters the narrow pass. "I don't get to talk to many people about things."</font><br>

[Fri Jun  2 21:51:11 2006] : <B>(7) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>The pass is in shadow; and a dry breeze blows through it, still cool, but even less than before.</font><br>
[Fri Jun  2 21:52:02 2006] : <B>(7) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>And on the other side is a green valley, rising up between two mountain ridges, with a white mansion like a crown near its top.</font><br>
[Fri Jun  2 21:52:25 2006] : <font color='#008000'>** (9) Aryk slows to take it in. **</font><br>
[Fri Jun  2 21:53:01 2006] : <B>(7) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>The valley has some farm plots, long since gone to seed; some buildings, perhaps workshops or servant quarters, long since abandoned and broken down; and, up near the mansion, a squash court, well-maintained.</font><br>
[Fri Jun  2 21:53:02 2006] : <B>(3) Rien</B>: <font color='#004000'>"Well, I'm not in the least surprised."</font><br>
[Fri Jun  2 21:53:24 2006] : <B>(7) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>The surrounding mountains are different here than they were below the pass.</font><br>
[Fri Jun  2 21:54:47 2006] : <B>(7) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>"Not too much farther. This climb is short if you're welcome. Infinite if you're not."</font><br>
[Fri Jun  2 21:55:14 2006] : <B>(9) Aryk</B>: <font color='#000080'>"Sounds handy," murmurs Aryk.</font><br>
[Fri Jun  2 21:55:35 2006] : <B>(7) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>As you walk, the hills, grass, and trees warp around you, as if viewed through a distorting lens; but very slowly, so that you can detect the difference only in retrospect.</font><br>
[Fri Jun  2 21:55:36 2006] : <B>(8) Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>"Whirlwind Lionheart has a trick like that," Renate observes.</font><br>
[Fri Jun  2 21:56:00 2006] : <B>(7) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>You're simply covering more ground than you should.</font><br>
[Fri Jun  2 21:56:45 2006] : <B>(7) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>Rien can detect that this place is close to Chaos; the 'earth spirits' are likely one of the old powers.</font><br>
[Fri Jun  2 21:57:24 2006] : <B>(7) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>Colette takes a moment to check a pocketwatch; what she sees reassures her, because she doesn't check it again.</font><br>
[Fri Jun  2 21:57:31 2006] : <B>(7) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>"We have time."</font><br>
[Fri Jun  2 21:58:42 2006] : <B>(7) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>Ander Kurtzveil stops as you come close to the manor; mountains east of the valley cast its lower parts into shadow, but the manor house and its lawn is brightly illuminated; the white paint is peeling, but the wood underneath is bleached white by sun and wind as well.</font><br>
[Fri Jun  2 21:59:09 2006] : <B>(7) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>It glows like white sheets on a laundry line.</font><br>
[Fri Jun  2 21:59:33 2006] : <B>(7) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>"I will wait out here," Ander says. "I do not know everything, and should not."</font><br>
[Fri Jun  2 22:00:11 2006] : <B>(7) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>Colette opens the ornate front door of the manor with a hefty skeleton key.</font><br>
[Fri Jun  2 22:00:17 2006] : <B>(8) Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>"We will return for you. Shall we leave you a cloak, Grandmaster?"</font><br>
[Fri Jun  2 22:00:40 2006] : <B>(7) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>"It is a stereotype of 'power,' but I do not much feel the cold."</font><br>
[Fri Jun  2 22:00:52 2006] : <B>(9) Aryk</B>: <font color='#000080'>Aryk, now walking more toward the rear of the group, turns to Ander.  "Thanks, Mr. Kurtzveil.  In my eyes, you've almost nearly redeemed yourself."</font><br>
[Fri Jun  2 22:01:34 2006] : <B>(7) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>"I'll get to paradise yet," he says with a lightly sarcastic note of hope.</font><br>
[Fri Jun  2 22:01:46 2006] : <font color='#008000'>** (9) Aryk nods to him with a faint smile, and proceeds. **</font><br>
[Fri Jun  2 22:02:57 2006] : <font color='#008000'>** (3) Rien escorts Renate inside, and whispers to Aryk, "redeemed himself?  What did he do that requires redemption?" **</font><br>
[Fri Jun  2 22:03:37 2006] : <B>(9) Aryk</B>: <font color='#000080'>Aryk mutters to Rien.  "He lead you around like a stray dog.  Guy with that much ability should have been more willing to openly help you, bro."</font><br>
[Fri Jun  2 22:03:54 2006] : <B>(7) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>The interior of the manor is a worn-down and dusty barrens, with occasional piece of white-sheeted furniture. But since you leave no footprints in the dust, it seems clear that this, too, is protective illusion.</font><br>
[Fri Jun  2 22:04:02 2006] : <B>(9) Aryk</B>: <font color='#000080'>"If his heart's in the right place, that is."</font><br>
[Fri Jun  2 22:04:50 2006] : <B>(9) Aryk</B>: <font color='#000080'>"Doesn't matter," says Aryk, tracing his finger along a dusty end table and leaving no trail.  "Let's get on with it."</font><br>
[Fri Jun  2 22:05:15 2006] : <B>(7) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>"The traditional 'audience hall' is the ballroom," Colette says, leading you up a sweeping staircase.</font><br>
[Fri Jun  2 22:06:28 2006] : <font color='#008000'>** (8) Renate straightens her back and remembers her most elegant grace, proud of the paladin and the prince to either side of her. **</font><br>
[Fri Jun  2 22:06:32 2006] : <B>(7) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>The manor is silent; no, the silence is an illusion as well, and Rien (who is versed in such matters) and Renate (who has learned to trust her other senses and instincts) can detect the manor's true sound: a deep periodic humming from somewhere... outside it. Further up the mountain.</font><br>
[Fri Jun  2 22:07:13 2006] : <B>(3) Rien</B>: <font color='#004000'>"Almost like an outside transmission of white-noise to mask other sounds..." Rien murmurs to himself.</font><br>
[Fri Jun  2 22:07:54 2006] : <B>(9) Aryk</B>: <font color='#000080'>"The silence is an illusion, too, eh?  Peachy," mutters Aryk in return.</font><br>
[Fri Jun  2 22:07:59 2006] : <B>(7) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>Rien has heard this noise before, in fact... it was the sound that came from within the castle of Tarlochen, before its power core was wrenched away.</font><br>
[Fri Jun  2 22:09:09 2006] : <B>(7) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>A regal half-elf stands guard before richly-inlaid double doors. Explodist tattoos cover both his hands.</font><br>
[Fri Jun  2 22:10:04 2006] : <B>(7) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>"Under the Seven Precepts," Colette says to him, "and with the trust of the Appointed, I bring pilgrims into the presence of the Rising Sun."</font><br>
[Fri Jun  2 22:10:22 2006] : <font color='#008000'>** (9) Aryk steps up to Renate's side, and regards the half-elf. **</font><br>
[Fri Jun  2 22:10:29 2006] : <B>(7) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>The half-elf nods with crystalline poise. "May you find light." He steps aside, and Colette pushes the doors open.</font><br>
