[Fri Jun 10 17:52:26 2005] : <B>Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>So she was. Actually, her story, if she's not leaving anything out, is very transparent. Allow me to paraphrase:</font><br>
[Fri Jun 10 17:52:56 2005] : <B>Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>She dated a guy all through high school. He was in love with her. She didn't quite return the feeling, not enough. He wanted to get married right after graduation. She declined. She thought it was patched.</font><br>
[Fri Jun 10 17:53:06 2005] : <B>Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>SHE WAS RIGHT.</font><br>
[Fri Jun 10 17:53:07 2005] : <B>Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>At the graduation party, he took actions that publicly insulted her.</font><br>
[Fri Jun 10 17:53:20 2005] : <B>Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>She was mortified.</font><br>
[Fri Jun 10 17:53:20 2005] : <B>Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>*eyeroll*</font><br>
[Fri Jun 10 17:53:29 2005] : <B>Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>Glad she didn't marry the chump. Sheesh.</font><br>
[Fri Jun 10 17:53:53 2005] : <B>Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>And yet instead of saying "he was a dick," she's saying "wow, I guess I really *am* as full of bullshit as he said!"</font><br>
[Fri Jun 10 17:53:57 2005] : <B>Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>I have to ask, though -- are you robbing the cradle again, dude?</font><br>
[Fri Jun 10 17:54:35 2005] : <B>Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>She's 21 and embarking-on-career.</font><br>
[Fri Jun 10 17:54:37 2005] : <B>Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>Good enough?</font><br>
[Fri Jun 10 17:54:46 2005] : <B>Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>Post-college, at least by a hair.</font><br>
[Fri Jun 10 17:54:50 2005] : <B>Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>Yeah, that's okay.</font><br>
[Fri Jun 10 17:55:09 2005] : <B>Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>I'm surprised the mortification lasted through college, though.</font><br>
[Fri Jun 10 17:55:20 2005] : <B>Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>Usually college is where women figure out how much they don't actually suck.</font><br>
[Fri Jun 10 17:55:44 2005] : <B>Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>I get the unspoken impression that she went through a phase involving some string-free physical relationships.</font><br>
[Fri Jun 10 17:55:51 2005] : <B>Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>Oh, okay.</font><br>
[Fri Jun 10 17:55:59 2005] : <B>Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>That sometimes doesn't do much for the self-worth.</font><br>

[Fri Jun 10 17:56:43 2005] : <B>Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>I let her know, also in non-specific terms, that I didn't disapprove of her actions. Everyone's entitled to a certain amount of that.</font><br>
[Fri Jun 10 17:56:59 2005] : <B>Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>Every now and then someone doesn't get past it.</font><br>
[Fri Jun 10 17:57:14 2005] : <B>Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>Yeah.</font><br>
[Fri Jun 10 17:57:40 2005] : <B>Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>Some guys can be assholes about that in a girl. I don't see the big deal, myself, assuming a modicum of care with regard to health.</font><br>
[Fri Jun 10 17:58:04 2005] : <B>Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>Anyway, I'm not putting all my chickens in one basket, but on the other hand, I can pretty much guarantee that if she bites the bullet and meets me, all will be well.</font><br>
[Fri Jun 10 17:58:34 2005] : <B>Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>I agree. :)</font><br>
[Fri Jun 10 17:58:35 2005] : <B>Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>And what were the chances of meeting someone in a nation-wide MMO, who is in every way romantic-lead material, within an hour's drive? That's fate yelling.</font><br>

[Fri Jun 10 18:00:13 2005] : <B>Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>but I think Alan's going for coffee</font><br>
[Fri Jun 10 18:00:32 2005] : <B>Aryk</B>: <font color='#000080'>NP, I'm scarfing on pizza at the moment anyway.</font><br>
[Fri Jun 10 18:00:50 2005] : <B>Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>Yes, I was in the kitchen pouring a cup. Mmm.</font><br>

[Fri Jun 10 18:01:33 2005] : <B>Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>Any luck looking up the management of those festivals, Matt? I admit I just send you a sort of general set of information.</font><br>
[Fri Jun 10 18:01:41 2005] : <B>Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>A little devoted Googling would turn up a ton more.</font><br>
[Fri Jun 10 18:02:14 2005] : <B>Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>I'm certain each festival has its own committee or even corporation that governs street vendors.</font><br>
[Fri Jun 10 18:02:40 2005] : <B>Aryk</B>: <font color='#000080'>I haven't tried yet.  I finally got my first real paycheck today.  Tomorrow morning I'm going supply shopping.  Afterwards I'll try to get a hold of them.  I want to see what supplies I'll have available before I call anyone, so I'll know what to tell them I'll be available to do, you know?  </font><br>
[Fri Jun 10 18:02:52 2005] : <B>Aryk</B>: <font color='#000080'>But good lookin' out on the info.  I really appreciate it.</font><br>
[Fri Jun 10 18:03:00 2005] : <B>Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>They'll all almost certainly be charging you for the right to set up a booth, too.</font><br>
[Fri Jun 10 18:03:10 2005] : <B>Aryk</B>: <font color='#000080'>Yeah, I'm sure they will.</font><br>
[Fri Jun 10 18:03:24 2005] : <B>Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>But with a good crowd on a good day, you can make it back in a blink.</font><br>
[Fri Jun 10 18:03:33 2005] : <B>Aryk</B>: <font color='#000080'>I'm not working with much (the check was pretty crappy), but I'm sure I could work something out.</font><br>
[Fri Jun 10 18:03:41 2005] : <B>Aryk</B>: <font color='#000080'>Oh, definitely.</font><br>
[Fri Jun 10 18:04:12 2005] : <B>Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>Well, most of these are community affairs; you may be able to work something out if you're cash-poor up front.</font><br>
[Fri Jun 10 18:04:35 2005] : <B>Aryk</B>: <font color='#000080'>That's a good point.</font><br>

[Fri Jun 10 18:13:34 2005] : <B>Rien</B>: <font color='#004040'>"Yes, thankyou Colette.  I know now why you were in the Dragon War Artifact Museum that day.  Were you really targetting that nameless minion of Ankoku, or me?"</font><br>
[Fri Jun 10 18:14:51 2005] : <B>Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>Raven and Colette exchange glances. "Both," Colette says. "I knew who you were. I didn't know you'd sworn off ties."</font><br>

[Fri Jun 10 18:20:08 2005] : <B>Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>"If this turns out to be the real item, Andragar is prevented from working evil."</font><br>
[Fri Jun 10 18:20:12 2005] : <B>Rien</B>: <font color='#004040'>"You take this back to the tour with you?  That's as well as simply handing it to Darm, you do know that."</font><br>
[Fri Jun 10 18:20:31 2005] : <B>Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>"I didn't say where we'd take it," Raven points out.</font><br>
[Fri Jun 10 18:21:04 2005] : <B>Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>"You implied, though," Colette says.</font><br>

[Fri Jun 10 18:22:13 2005] : <B>Rien</B>: <font color='#004040'>"Your purpose is to keep this from Darm, and thusly Andragar, correct?"</font><br>
[Fri Jun 10 18:22:21 2005] : <B>Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>"Entirely," Raven declares.</font><br>
[Fri Jun 10 18:22:50 2005] : <B>Rien</B>: <font color='#004040'>"Raven, don't make such sweeping, grand statements; they don't help your credibility."</font><br>
[Fri Jun 10 18:23:13 2005] : <B>Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>"Well, and to study it," Colette says. "Is that the part you want to know?"</font><br>
[Fri Jun 10 18:23:17 2005] : <B>Rien</B>: <font color='#004040'>"Now... are you all sure that Darm doesn't know who you are and who you work for?"</font><br>

[Fri Jun 10 20:14:18 2005] : <B>Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>As the demon absorbs the last of the exploding ring and keeps coming, Darm gets a counterspell off, shattering the mirror into mist, and Colette falls backward; the demon pounces at the same time as Darm spins to block another two blows, countering, weaving as Raven Fades in and out of visibility.</font><br>
[Fri Jun 10 20:15:26 2005] : <B>Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>Rien's Spellblade winks out; transcendently calm now, he extends his arms to either side, and gravel turns to crystal beneath his feet.</font><br>
[Fri Jun 10 20:16:34 2005] : <B>Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>"You battle those who came in peace," Rien says, the perfect resonant tones of the old trance-form.</font><br>
[Fri Jun 10 20:18:19 2005] : <B>Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>Between the whirling dust of atoms and molecules that makes up reality, the Astral Plane sparkles; its endless fractal probabilities govern atomic decay, coin flips, human hearts, and how fairy tales end.</font><br>
[Fri Jun 10 20:20:04 2005] : <B>Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>Its raw substance shifts like kicked sand beneath Rien's hand, and an intricate explosion of light, like a thousand interlocking flowers, spirals in on Darm Sobreda&ntilde;s chest, compressing to a pinpoint and punching through his armor like a sword made out of the sun.</font><br>
[Fri Jun 10 20:21:27 2005] : <B>Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>His last expression is amazement, as he staggers backward, his arcblade wisping away like smoke; his demon dies as well, turning to an inert hunk of mundane ice, slowly melting on the quarry floor.</font><br>
[Fri Jun 10 20:23:14 2005] : <B>Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>Rien has grabbed hold of true magic: the unconscious manipulation of the purest stuff of the Astral Plane, the effortless command of the laws of quanta.

[Fri Jun 10 20:25:01 2005] : <B>Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>In that version, he joins Darm, takes Colette and Raven prisoner, stands before Dark Eternal as his son; and in reward, learns who he truly is.</font><br>

[Fri Jun 10 20:26:39 2005] : <B>Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>Reality twists and bucks like a Moebius strip as Rien sorts its threads, seeking out a perfect configuration: Darm dead with a hole in his chest, balance of nature restored with Raven's mortal soul, Colette unburned and reassured...</font><br>
[Fri Jun 10 20:27:23 2005] : <B>Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>Time runs backwards: the duels; the standoff; the conversation with Raven and Colette; all the way back to the mad rush through the country, seeking the quarry and the stone before anyone else can reach it.</font><br>
[Fri Jun 10 20:28:17 2005] : <B>Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>Rien sorts through threads of possibility, picking them out, braiding them together; what if he had never had to use the Limit Break at all?

[Fri Jun 10 20:29:19 2005] : <B>Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>And then, by rewriting fate to avoid the Limit Break, he could avoid its risks! A work of genius; an advance through the quarry, stealth broken only by Aryk's stubbed toe and accompanying quip, Renate's jab to his ribs, Rien's meditative silence, ah, life as it should be.</font><br>
[Fri Jun 10 20:30:44 2005] : <B>Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>A brilliant flash of light from Colette's lamps, for them to see <i>three</i> heroes instead of one; a hasty agreement that Renate, having proven herself no friend of Dark Eternal, should hold the stone; and in this Grand Dream, Renate's insight into their bargaining positions leads to an easier resolution.</font><br>
[Fri Jun 10 20:31:49 2005] : <B>Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>The lights are dimmed, in time for Darm's dramatic entrance... but now he is outnumbered, and though perhaps in a less impressive dream he might have backed down, in this one he attacks heedlessly, and is killed at a stroke by Rien's flashing blade.</font><br>
[Fri Jun 10 20:33:00 2005] : <B>Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>Ah, <i>now</i> reality begins to look like it should! Heaven defeated, potential allies preserved, good friends at his side; Rien stirs the whirlwind of electron paths and recurring legend one last time, sealing it in its current form, and releases his newfound power, not without a tinge of regret.</font><br>
[Fri Jun 10 20:33:27 2005] : <B>Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>And collapses into a coma, at the very brink of complete and irreversible death.</font><br>

[Fri Jun 10 20:36:27 2005] : <B>Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>(Neither you nor the character had any way of knowing it would cause you to lose control of your actions; now you both do, of course. And note that the effect will get worse before it gets better.)</font><br>
[Fri Jun 10 20:37:12 2005] : <B>Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>(Currently? Darm is dead; Colette and Raven offered the stone into Renate's safekeeping, without making Rien give up that information about the 'blazing sword'; and Renate is blind.)</font><br>

[Fri Jun 10 21:10:32 2005] : <B>Aryk</B>: <font color='#000080'>"Yeah, of course."  He picks up Rien.  "Rennie... take a hold of my shoulder."  He doesn't know precisely what's wrong with his sister, but he recognizes at least that she needs guidance.</font><br>
[Fri Jun 10 21:11:20 2005] : <B>Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>"Thank you; I will." She makes her way toward him, slowly, hands spread before her.</font><br>
[Fri Jun 10 21:11:46 2005] : <font color='#008000'>** Aryk guides her hand to his shoulder.  He's beginning to realize what's happened to her... **</font><br>
[Fri Jun 10 21:11:59 2005] : <B>Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>"Right; let's go, then."</font><br>
[Fri Jun 10 21:12:00 2005] : <B>Aryk</B>: <font color='#000080'>"It's your eyes, isn't it?"</font><br>
[Fri Jun 10 21:12:22 2005] : <B>Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>"Yes. Let's go. Rien needs help."</font><br>
[Fri Jun 10 21:12:32 2005] : <font color='#008000'>** Aryk nods and leads the way. **</font><br>
[Fri Jun 10 21:14:20 2005] : <B>Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>Log is off... this is the end of the chapter. There are two more shows.</font><br>
[Fri Jun 10 21:14:25 2005] : <B>Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>One in Ilium, one in Ys/Xanadu.</font><br>
[Fri Jun 10 21:14:46 2005] : <B>Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>But nothing exceptional happens at them; Darm is gone, security is fine; nobody gets assassinated or murdered.</font><br>
[Fri Jun 10 21:15:13 2005] : <B>Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>And after that... the world is your oyster. Rien recovers; Renate learns to cope; and your next steps are up to you.</font><br>
[Fri Jun 10 21:15:29 2005] : <B>Aryk</B>: <font color='#000080'>But... what about Aryk's rap concert?!</font><br>
[Fri Jun 10 21:15:37 2005] : <B>Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>Okay, that's exceptional.</font><br>
[Fri Jun 10 21:15:39 2005] : <B>Aryk</B>: <font color='#000080'>Dude, I've got material!</font><br>
[Fri Jun 10 21:15:41 2005] : <B>Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>Ah, yes. That deserves to get played out.</font><br>
[Fri Jun 10 21:15:46 2005] : <B>Aryk</B>: <font color='#000080'>Oh, okay.  Hah hah</font><br>
[Fri Jun 10 21:15:57 2005] : <B>Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>And Renate was hoping to get Talos to recreate the stunt from Eridu.</font><br>
[Fri Jun 10 21:16:17 2005] : <B>Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>With any luck, it catches on, and all the cool kids from Ys and Xanadu do it too. :)</font><br>
[Fri Jun 10 21:16:26 2005] : <B>Aryk</B>: <font color='#000080'>Can we go as far as to say that the people of Ilium are like "Hey, that Aryk paladin guy, he's rapper, did you know that?"</font><br>
[Fri Jun 10 21:16:36 2005] : <B>Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>naw, I wanna hear the show!</font><br>
[Fri Jun 10 21:16:38 2005] : <B>Aryk</B>: <font color='#000080'>Heh heh</font><br>
[Fri Jun 10 21:17:36 2005] : <B>Rien</B>: <font color='#004040'>indeed</font><br>
[Fri Jun 10 21:17:37 2005] : <B>Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>Well, we can play it out, but I'm a bit cramped for time, too. Let's use up the next session in intermediate/epilogue stuff, wrapping up loose ends such as that.</font><br>
[Fri Jun 10 21:17:46 2005] : <B>Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>There's a ton of stuff to deal with.</font><br>
[Fri Jun 10 21:18:04 2005] : <B>Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>Fine by me, and yes, there is.</font><br>
[Fri Jun 10 21:18:09 2005] : <B>Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>Rennie wants to see her lawyers. :)</font><br>
[Fri Jun 10 21:18:14 2005] : <B>Rien</B>: <font color='#004040'>and Sashi's gotta come into the equations before or at the start of the next chapter, according to the timeline you gave me about her a while back Alan</font><br>
[Fri Jun 10 21:18:35 2005] : <B>Aryk</B>: <font color='#000080'>So much to do...</font><br>
[Fri Jun 10 21:18:53 2005] : <B>Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>And of course Renate gets to explain to Coris why his good buddy Darm is BHR. That'll be fun.</font><br>
[Fri Jun 10 21:19:27 2005] : <B>Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>Well, I left that open.</font><br>
[Fri Jun 10 21:19:36 2005] : <B>Aryk</B>: <font color='#000080'>Well, all Aryk's plans for this chapter only include making a name for himself in the "rap game."  After that, everything he's concerned with can be dealt with in the proceeding chapters.</font><br>
[Fri Jun 10 21:19:43 2005] : <B>Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>I had "shot through the chest with a beam of light."</font><br>
[Fri Jun 10 21:19:43 2005] : <B>Aryk</B>: <font color='#000080'>What's BHR?</font><br>
[Fri Jun 10 21:19:50 2005] : <B>Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>Beyond hope of resurrection.</font><br>
[Fri Jun 10 21:20:04 2005] : <B>Aryk</B>: <font color='#000080'>Oh, ha ha LOL</font><br>
[Fri Jun 10 21:20:04 2005] : <B>Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>Shipping him would be a whole different game.</font><br>
[Fri Jun 10 21:20:16 2005] : <B>Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>Ah, I see. Okay. Still, we get to explain.</font><br>
[Fri Jun 10 21:20:30 2005] : <B>Aryk</B>: <font color='#000080'>Nah, just leave the fucker in the cave.  :-)</font><br>
[Fri Jun 10 21:20:39 2005] : <B>Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>I mean, if you want him shipped, I could work with that. It would make things a lot worse for you, though.</font><br>
[Fri Jun 10 21:20:52 2005] : <B>Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>No, I'm cool with just plain dead.</font><br>
[Fri Jun 10 21:21:03 2005] : <B>Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>It's the honorable thing, I think.</font><br>
[Fri Jun 10 21:21:16 2005] : <B>Aryk</B>: <font color='#000080'>That would be JPD, then.</font><br>
[Fri Jun 10 21:21:23 2005] : <B>Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>yep</font><br>
[Fri Jun 10 21:21:42 2005] : <B>Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>Sorry you didn't get to bust the stone, Aryk, but that was too good a chance to pass up.</font><br>
[Fri Jun 10 21:21:51 2005] : <B>Rien</B>: <font color='#004040'>huh?</font><br>
[Fri Jun 10 21:22:00 2005] : <B>Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>JPD -- just plain dead. :)</font><br>
[Fri Jun 10 21:23:06 2005] : <B>Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>I actually had the brainstorm about the sacrifice mid-session, as Adrian can attest.</font><br>
[Fri Jun 10 21:23:08 2005] : <B>Aryk</B>: <font color='#000080'>I understand.  Aryk might not, but I do.</font><br>
[Fri Jun 10 21:23:25 2005] : <B>Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>Well, Aryk can take it up with her if he wants to. She'll cop to personal profit on that one.</font><br>
[Fri Jun 10 21:24:38 2005] : <B>Rien</B>: <font color='#004040'>yes, she did</font><br>
[Fri Jun 10 21:24:49 2005] : <B>Rien</B>: <font color='#004040'>but Rien couldn't get away with it to give it to her</font><br>
[Fri Jun 10 21:25:02 2005] : <B>Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>don't feel bad, Adrian</font><br>
[Fri Jun 10 21:25:04 2005] : <B>Rien</B>: <font color='#004040'>but tell me though...</font><br>
[Fri Jun 10 21:25:05 2005] : <B>Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>it was a pretty nasty situation</font><br>
[Fri Jun 10 21:25:14 2005] : <B>Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>you dealt with it well</font><br>
[Fri Jun 10 21:25:18 2005] : <B>Aryk</B>: <font color='#000080'>Nah, he's only pissed he made a deal with a demon for no good reason.</font><br>
[Fri Jun 10 21:25:44 2005] : <B>Aryk</B>: <font color='#000080'>yeah, I'd have done the same thing, Adrian.</font><br>
[Fri Jun 10 21:25:49 2005] : <B>Rien</B>: <font color='#004040'>Darm was quite surprised when Rien killed him... was that because he was just supremely confident that Rien couldn't hurt him, or becuase Rien went well beyond the powers that anyone knew he had?</font><br>
[Fri Jun 10 21:26:12 2005] : <B>Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>Interesting question. We don't know what exactly Heaven knows about Rien's past.</font><br>
[Fri Jun 10 21:27:10 2005] : <B>Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>Maybe it's just plain surprising to get a beam of light through the chest capable of killing you.</font><br>
[Fri Jun 10 21:28:05 2005] : <B>Rien</B>: <font color='#004040'>perhaps</font><br>
[Fri Jun 10 21:28:43 2005] : <B>Aryk</B>: <font color='#000080'>OMG Alan's dead again!</font><br>
[Fri Jun 10 21:28:58 2005] : <B>Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>Oh no!</font><br>
[Fri Jun 10 21:29:00 2005] : <B>Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>No, I'm just not answering the question.</font><br>
[Fri Jun 10 21:29:05 2005] : <B>Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>Heh.</font><br>
[Fri Jun 10 21:29:23 2005] : <B>Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>He sure was surprised, though!</font><br>
[Fri Jun 10 21:29:34 2005] : <B>Aryk</B>: <font color='#000080'>LOL</font><br>
[Fri Jun 10 21:29:49 2005] : <B>Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>yep, definitely a shocker</font><br>
[Fri Jun 10 21:30:31 2005] : <B>Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>Okay, all y'all except Alan: do we tell Cobalt Aerie the whole truth?</font><br>
[Fri Jun 10 21:30:59 2005] : <B>Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>(And what I want to know is, WTF was up Noble Mercury's ass that he didn't figure out he had a stone under his nose?)</font><br>
[Fri Jun 10 21:31:11 2005] : <B>Aryk</B>: <font color='#000080'>BTW Alan how was Mosaics this week?  Sorry I stil couldn't make it.  I should be able to make it this Wednesday though.</font><br>
[Fri Jun 10 21:31:14 2005] : <B>Aryk</B>: <font color='#000080'>Dorothea:  Naw.  </font><br>
[Fri Jun 10 21:31:15 2005] : <B>Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>(Snout. Nose. Whatever.)</font><br>
[Fri Jun 10 21:31:20 2005] : <B>Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>Why not, Matt?</font><br>
[Fri Jun 10 21:31:54 2005] : <B>Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>The stone was just recently unearthed; some people came to examine it, realized what it was, paid off the quarry owners, and sold the information.)</font><br>
[Fri Jun 10 21:32:02 2005] : <B>Aryk</B>: <font color='#000080'>I imagine the stones are pretty undetectable.  Like Alan said, they are hardly even magical unless subjected to some big magic machine thing.</font><br>
[Fri Jun 10 21:32:04 2005] : <B>Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>Heads are going to roll.</font><br>
[Fri Jun 10 21:32:05 2005] : <B>Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>(Ah. But not to NM.)</font><br>
[Fri Jun 10 21:32:30 2005] : <B>Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>And the Mosaic was sweet. I got a pianist to play along with my rapping. It was very ... classical.</font><br>
[Fri Jun 10 21:32:41 2005] : <B>Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>Cool.</font><br>
[Fri Jun 10 21:32:52 2005] : <B>Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>And included the line "While my skills accelerate to hit Warp Nine / yours are looking old like Ernest Borgnine"</font><br>
[Fri Jun 10 21:33:08 2005] : <B>Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>"Drink some Metamucil and watch some Matlock, cause I got your game chained with a padlock"</font><br>
[Fri Jun 10 21:33:11 2005] : <B>Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>Dude, I realize it's the genre and all, but you are WAY too hung up on rapping your own rap skills. :)</font><br>
[Fri Jun 10 21:33:14 2005] : <B>Aryk</B>: <font color='#000080'>D:  Why would we want to tell the public our buddy offed a Heaven Knight?  I mean, sure, we're glad it happened, but do we really want to give Andragar the heads up that "Yeah, it was us.  What are you going to do about it?"</font><br>
[Fri Jun 10 21:33:24 2005] : <B>Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>I rather think we do, actually.</font><br>
[Fri Jun 10 21:33:35 2005] : <B>Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>It's time we got in on some of the bigger discussions and events, and how better to do it?</font><br>
[Fri Jun 10 21:33:38 2005] : <B>Aryk</B>: <font color='#000080'>At least at this point they can stil pin it on Soleil, not us.</font><br>
[Fri Jun 10 21:33:46 2005] : <B>Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>Is that what we want, though?</font><br>
[Fri Jun 10 21:33:59 2005] : <B>Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>90% of rap is about the rapper's own skill. The actual content isn't usually the point.</font><br>
[Fri Jun 10 21:34:09 2005] : <B>Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>Hmph.</font><br>
[Fri Jun 10 21:34:12 2005] : <B>Aryk</B>: <font color='#000080'>Alan:  That is AWESOME.</font><br>
[Fri Jun 10 21:34:47 2005] : <B>Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>I'm actually coming full circle on the Nobles. I think we need them in our corner, and vice versa.</font><br>
[Fri Jun 10 21:35:06 2005] : <B>Aryk</B>: <font color='#000080'>I guess you're right about that, D.  Well, if she wants to run to the papers to give them the scoop, Aryk won't stop her.</font><br>
[Fri Jun 10 21:35:08 2005] : <B>Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>And it's not like they're going to be exactly fond of Darm.</font><br>
[Fri Jun 10 21:35:18 2005] : <B>Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>She is SO not telling the papers about this!</font><br>
[Fri Jun 10 21:35:28 2005] : <B>Aryk</B>: <font color='#000080'>It's what he wants, but Aryk's not going to go out of his way to invite trouble. At least, till the album comes out.</font><br>
[Fri Jun 10 21:35:28 2005] : <B>Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>But she'll tell Cobalt Aerie, sure.</font><br>
[Fri Jun 10 21:35:51 2005] : <B>Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>The papers can attribute her blindness to the Jenner attack.</font><br>
[Fri Jun 10 21:35:53 2005] : <B>Rien</B>: <font color='#004040'>especially since telling the whole truth (once she hears it from Rien) will place him as a Big Fat Obvious Threat</font><br>
[Fri Jun 10 21:35:57 2005] : <B>Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>Same night. Who's to know?</font><br>
[Fri Jun 10 21:36:04 2005] : <B>Aryk</B>: <font color='#000080'>Right.</font><br>
[Fri Jun 10 21:36:06 2005] : <B>Rien</B>: <font color='#004040'>or an asset that people are gonna want to possess like crazy</font><br>
[Fri Jun 10 21:36:11 2005] : <B>Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>Oh, come on, like Noble Mercury didn't already know that.</font><br>
[Fri Jun 10 21:36:18 2005] : <B>Rien</B>: <font color='#004040'>cuz, like, he's a guy who can very literally affect time and reality</font><br>
[Fri Jun 10 21:36:21 2005] : <B>Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>Why do you think he cosseted Rien for three years?</font><br>
[Fri Jun 10 21:36:22 2005] : <B>Rien</B>: <font color='#004040'>not about this he didn't</font><br>
[Fri Jun 10 21:36:47 2005] : <B>Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>Whether he can do it at will, or in any controllable fashion -- especially controllable by a third party -- is up in the air.</font><br>
[Fri Jun 10 21:37:04 2005] : <B>Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>Erm, I don't think we're going to be trying THAT little stunt again any time soon.</font><br>
[Fri Jun 10 21:37:13 2005] : <B>Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>I didn't quite realize what it would do, or I wouldn't have pushed it.</font><br>
[Fri Jun 10 21:37:33 2005] : <B>Aryk</B>: <font color='#000080'>Yeah, me either.</font><br>
[Fri Jun 10 21:37:38 2005] : <B>Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>Which was the point.</font><br>
[Fri Jun 10 21:37:58 2005] : <B>Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>The idea behind Rien's "power limiter" is that Dark Eternal put it there for damned good reasons.</font><br>
[Fri Jun 10 21:38:07 2005] : <B>Aryk</B>: <font color='#000080'>But D's got a point, though.  NM knows somewhat of what Rien's capable of.  He wouldn't have had his peeps string us along, otherwise.</font><br>
[Fri Jun 10 21:38:10 2005] : <B>Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>If Renate hadn't been blinded, she'd have taken Darm out anyway, by the way.</font><br>
[Fri Jun 10 21:38:31 2005] : <B>Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>Birthday present from Trancey ought to have been enough for that.</font><br>
[Fri Jun 10 21:39:32 2005] : <B>Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>So, any objections to telling Noble Mercury the truth, the whole truth, and, um, very little but the truth?</font><br>
[Fri Jun 10 21:40:19 2005] : <B>Aryk</B>: <font color='#000080'>... I plead the 5th.</font><br>
[Fri Jun 10 21:40:34 2005] : <B>Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>Heh.</font><br>
[Fri Jun 10 21:40:42 2005] : <B>Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>Well, Rennie's gonna do it unless you stop her.</font><br>
[Fri Jun 10 21:41:08 2005] : <B>Rien</B>: <font color='#004040'>well she should wait until after Rien wakes up, then</font><br>
[Fri Jun 10 21:41:16 2005] : <B>Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>of course</font><br>
[Fri Jun 10 21:41:19 2005] : <B>Rien</B>: <font color='#004040'>becuase there's a whole big swag o' truth she doesn't know yet</font><br>
[Fri Jun 10 21:41:22 2005] : <B>Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>everything takes a back seat to that</font><br>
[Fri Jun 10 21:41:26 2005] : <B>Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>oh, *that*</font><br>
[Fri Jun 10 21:41:31 2005] : <B>Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>um, that they don't need to know. :)</font><br>
[Fri Jun 10 21:41:42 2005] : <B>Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>We'll stick to the one timeline, methinks.</font><br>
[Fri Jun 10 21:41:48 2005] : <B>Rien</B>: <font color='#004040'>heh</font><br>
[Fri Jun 10 21:42:19 2005] : <B>Aryk</B>: <font color='#000080'>It would only confuse Aryk, anyway.</font><br>
[Fri Jun 10 21:42:27 2005] : <B>Aryk</B>: <font color='#000080'>"Dude, whatever.  I was there the whole time."</font><br>
