[Fri Feb 26 18:32:36 2010] : <b>(4226) Alan</b>: <font color='#000080'>Alessandro is fairly forthcoming: he says that they were built a few hundred years after the conclusion of the Dragon War, by a group of dragons who had been on a technological fast track since the very start.</font><br />
[Fri Feb 26 18:33:09 2010] : <b>(4226) Alan</b>: <font color='#000080'>The Council knew that if they were going to keep most of the world under control, technologically, they'd need a shadow group with advanced technology, as a safeguard.</font><br />
[Fri Feb 26 18:34:18 2010] : <b>(4226) Alan</b>: <font color='#000080'>So during and after the war, dragons and some human assistants were quickly bootstrapping from indigenous metalworking techniques up to the kind of advanced chemistry and metallurgy (and magic) you need to get building materials into space.</font><br />
[Fri Feb 26 18:34:30 2010] : <b>(4226) Alan</b>: <font color='#000080'>Putting humans in space was not a priority at first, so vehicles were not required!</font><br />
[Fri Feb 26 18:35:15 2010] : <b>(4226) Alan</b>: <font color='#000080'>Dragons don't breathe, and usually aren't adversely affected by vacuum, so they can just fly around up there as long as they can generate thrust.</font><br />
[Fri Feb 26 18:36:06 2010] : <b>(4226) Alan</b>: <font color='#000080'>Once dragons got some metalcrafting operations going up in space, using materials from earth, they set to work designing machines to mine metal from asteroids and the moon, which obviously have much less stringest escape requirements than the earth.</font><br />
[Fri Feb 26 18:36:27 2010] : <b>(4226) Alan</b>: <font color='#000080'>Getting to space was the hard part; once there, they were able to start fortifying it.</font><br />
[Fri Feb 26 18:36:57 2010] : <b>(4224) Renate</b>: <font color='#000080'>"Are the names of the dragons and mortals who participated in the building recorded?"</font><br />
[Fri Feb 26 18:37:18 2010] : <b>(4226) Alan</b>: <font color='#000080'>Accomodating humans, and staffing the outposts with handpicked humans, was the next step. Every mortal who had helped the dragons with their technology was marked for exile from the get-go -- they knew this from the start.</font><br />
[Fri Feb 26 18:38:26 2010] : <b>(4226) Alan</b>: <font color='#000080'>They formed the original few thousand of Rubylith's subjects. Rubylith was given operational control of the orbital strongpoints and a few other facilities, subject to regular audit by the Council (you can guess how that turned out -- a bureaucratic cold war that persists to this day).</font><br />
[Fri Feb 26 18:39:06 2010] : <b>(4226) Alan</b>: <font color='#000080'>The names of those mortals are recorded in the annals of the Empire of the Planets, since they're the founding fathers. The names of the dragons, on the other hand, are kept mum.</font><br />

[Fri Feb 26 18:41:09 2010] : <b>(4226) Alan</b>: <font color='#000080'>Alessandro ventures this information cheerfully. Probably only Rien knows who the Iron Claw is -- she's a dragon who rules a powerful nation on the continent across the sea to the east, beyond the Eastlands.</font><br />
