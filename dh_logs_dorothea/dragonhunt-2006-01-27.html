Remember the vaporators you see outside Rivalon, when you're on the train?  The big machines that keep crops constantly irrigated?  How much you want to bet humans use those because dragons gave them the idea?  And how much do you want to bet that, had dragons never been around, humans would have vaporators in the pockets! Wait... that doesn't sound right.  Do you hear what I mean!  Humans have things like that because dragons say, 'here, use this!  It's great!'   They give them vaporators to control them.  To make them think they are helping, when they're only holding back!"  </font><br>
