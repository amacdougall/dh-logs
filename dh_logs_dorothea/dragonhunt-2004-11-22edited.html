And sometimes, in their endless struggles for power and domination, it becomes necessary for a <strong>dragon</strong> to die by <strong>human</strong> hands. On those times, the call goes out for a

[Mon Nov 22 20:51:26 2004] : <B>Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>Okay, log is on. You just got done talking to Abram Mayonet, who is searching for his cousin; and before that, Captain Nagle (Ilium Irregulars, retired) suggested you drop by a certain herbwife's cottage during the duels.</font><br>
[Mon Nov 22 20:51:55 2004] : <B>Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>Why wait? As soon as she can, Renate ducks out of the milling crowd and asks a local for directions to Goody Whemper's.</font><br>
[Mon Nov 22 20:52:17 2004] : <B>Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>If she can find Aaron by himself, so much the better -- she shouldn't yell at him in front of his ex-crewmates.</font><br>
[Mon Nov 22 20:52:39 2004] : <B>Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>However much he deserves to be yelled at.</font><br>
[Mon Nov 22 20:52:57 2004] : <B>Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>The cottage is at the end of a narrow but weedless stone path, in a corner of the village where it abuts a copse.</font><br>
[Mon Nov 22 20:53:12 2004] : <B>Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>A fair enough place to slip into town from the less-watched woods.</font><br>
[Mon Nov 22 20:53:32 2004] : <B>Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>Any horses tethered nearby? Aaron's is a foul-tempered old sorrel.</font><br>
[Mon Nov 22 20:53:36 2004] : <B>Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>A bellpull hangs by the door.</font><br>
[Mon Nov 22 20:53:58 2004] : <B>Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>Renate knows that horse; it's bitten her often and often.</font><br>
[Mon Nov 22 20:54:02 2004] : <B>Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>No horses at all; only a placid old goat chewing on some grass.</font><br>
[Mon Nov 22 20:54:39 2004] : <B>Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>Well, then. No help for it. Renate takes a careful look around (take 10 on a Spot check), and if nothing obvious intrudes on her notice, walks calmly up and pulls on the bell.</font><br>
[Mon Nov 22 20:55:30 2004] : <B>Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>A cursory look-and-listen brings sounds of light cooking; someone's home, that's all you can tell.</font><br>
[Mon Nov 22 20:55:43 2004] : <B>Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>Fine. The bell sounds inside.</font><br>
[Mon Nov 22 20:56:45 2004] : <B>Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>After a moment, the door opens, and an upright old lady greets you diffidently. "Hello, mistress."</font><br>
[Mon Nov 22 20:56:55 2004] : <B>Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>"Good morning."</font><br>
[Mon Nov 22 20:57:29 2004] : <B>Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>She wears widow's black; her wispy white hair is pulled back in a bun.</font><br>
[Mon Nov 22 20:57:50 2004] : <B>Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>"I'm Goodwife Whemper. Is there something I can do for you?"</font><br>
[Mon Nov 22 20:58:16 2004] : <B>Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>Her tone is guarded; a town like Glenworth isn't used to strangers any more than Karlbotel is.</font><br>
[Mon Nov 22 20:58:26 2004] : <B>Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>"I am sent by Captain Nagle to ask after a guest of yours. May I come in, please?"</font><br>
[Mon Nov 22 20:58:34 2004] : <B>Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>And the wandering sluggers come for the tournament have likely put the townsfolk on edge.</font><br>
[Mon Nov 22 20:58:46 2004] : <B>Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>(boy, if I were townsfolk I'd be on edge!)</font><br>
[Mon Nov 22 20:59:32 2004] : <B>Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>"Well, if the Captain vouches for you, I suppose so..." she gestures you inside. The place is spare; just a main room which combines kitchen, living room, and dining area, and a door that presumably leads to a bedchamber.</font><br>
[Mon Nov 22 20:59:50 2004] : <B>Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>"Thank you, Mistress. I am in your debt."</font><br>
[Mon Nov 22 21:00:00 2004] : <B>Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>A pleasant-smelling herbal concoction simmers on the pot-bellied stove.</font><br>
[Mon Nov 22 21:00:46 2004] : <B>Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>(Not that the mental image is important, but we're talking about the ones with the range on top, not the Franklin type with the stovepipe on top.)</font><br>
[Mon Nov 22 21:00:50 2004] : <B>Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>(heh)</font><br>
[Mon Nov 22 21:01:00 2004] : <B>Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>"May I ask if your guest is in at present?"</font><br>
[Mon Nov 22 21:02:07 2004] : <B>Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>"No, he is not. His lordship already went to the grounds to take a look at his competition."</font><br>
[Mon Nov 22 21:02:31 2004] : <B>Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>Renate blinks. "I'm sorry, <i>his Lordship</i>? Perhaps we do not speak of the same person."</font><br>
[Mon Nov 22 21:02:56 2004] : <B>Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>"I only speak of Sir Lundig. I thought you knew him."</font><br>
[Mon Nov 22 21:03:14 2004] : <B>Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>In fact, you do&#8212;he's the closest thing Karlbotel has to a champion chevalier.</font><br>
[Mon Nov 22 21:03:27 2004] : <B>Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>Which is to say, not very close at all, but at least he has a warhorse and a lance.</font><br>
[Mon Nov 22 21:03:32 2004] : <B>Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>Renate sighs. "You have no other guest but he?"</font><br>
[Mon Nov 22 21:04:02 2004] : <B>Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>He drills the militia in riding and conversely in anti-cavalry tactics.</font><br>
[Mon Nov 22 21:05:00 2004] : <B>Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>"Well, he has a squire, of course, who sleeps in the woodshed."</font><br>
[Mon Nov 22 21:05:03 2004] : <B>Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>"It is a man older than he I seek, not so tall but stronger-built, greying rather."</font><br>
[Mon Nov 22 21:05:32 2004] : <B>Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>Damn it. She had described Aaron to Captain Nagle. He couldn't have misunderstood her. What <i>is</i> this madness, and where is Aaron?</font><br>
[Mon Nov 22 21:05:38 2004] : <B>Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>You've met Sir Lundig's squire before; a good-natured man who is barely intelligent enough for the tasks of carrying and maintaining his master's equipment.</font><br>
[Mon Nov 22 21:06:00 2004] : <B>Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>"Ah, then it's Sir Lundig's squire you're after, no doubt about it."</font><br>
[Mon Nov 22 21:06:10 2004] : <B>Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>"Aha. Where might I find him?"</font><br>
[Mon Nov 22 21:06:35 2004] : <B>Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>"Oh, I'm certain he'd be with Sir Lundig, or else running his errands."</font><br>
[Mon Nov 22 21:06:43 2004] : <B>Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>"I haven't seen him today."</font><br>
[Mon Nov 22 21:07:05 2004] : <B>Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>"I rather think not," Renate muses. "Would it be an imposition, Mistress Whemper, if I had a look in your woodshed?"</font><br>
[Mon Nov 22 21:07:49 2004] : <B>Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>"Why, no, go right ahead. But I must say I don't think he'd be so lazy as to lie about sleeping at this late hour."</font><br>
[Mon Nov 22 21:08:26 2004] : <B>Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>"Thank you, ma'am. I won't trouble you further." Renate performs a country curtsey and leaves the way she came, circling around the back to look for the woodshed.</font><br>
[Mon Nov 22 21:08:42 2004] : <B>Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>Aaron can't be moseying around seeing sights; too much chance of running into the Rolling Jinx.</font><br>
[Mon Nov 22 21:09:22 2004] : <B>Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>After a brief adventure in which the goat takes an interest in eating your bootlace, you take a look in the woodshed, and although you don't find Aaron, you do find his travelling bag.</font><br>
[Mon Nov 22 21:09:35 2004] : <B>Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>His weapons aren't among the belongings he left behind, though.</font><br>
[Mon Nov 22 21:09:46 2004] : <B>Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>Figures. She rifles it; anything of interest?</font><br>
[Mon Nov 22 21:10:10 2004] : <B>Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>Just clothing and assorted travelling supplies. Anything useful in a fight is absent.</font><br>
[Mon Nov 22 21:10:17 2004] : <B>Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>Pen and paper?</font><br>
[Mon Nov 22 21:10:43 2004] : <B>Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>Of course; his journal is there, too, but it's ironbound and padlocked.</font><br>
[Mon Nov 22 21:11:15 2004] : <B>Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>He has said that he considers many of its contents dangeorus.</font><br>
[Mon Nov 22 21:11:47 2004] : <B>Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>She doesn't need the journal. She tears a piece in two, writes something on one half which she folds and puts into her own pocket. On the other half, she writes in a large bold hand, "GO HOME! RAVA" and leaves it in his bag.</font><br>
[Mon Nov 22 21:12:26 2004] : <B>Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>"Fine," she snarls at nothing in particular. "We settle this my way. It ends, here and now."</font><br>
[Mon Nov 22 21:12:53 2004] : <B>Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>And she leaves the woodshed and makes haste back to the fighting-ground, where she looks for the herald in charge of the individual challenges.</font><br>
[Mon Nov 22 21:13:15 2004] : <B>Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>(Though if Lundig or Aaron meets her eye, that'll do too!)</font><br>
[Mon Nov 22 21:13:44 2004] : <B>Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>You happen to spot Sir Lundig nearby; he's waving his archaic two-handed sword around in manly circles.</font><br>
[Mon Nov 22 21:14:05 2004] : <B>Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>She approaches and waits for him to deign to notice her.</font><br>
[Mon Nov 22 21:14:17 2004] : <B>Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>He's a military history buff among other things; you know, from him, that the sword was designed to fight against mounted or unmounted men.</font><br>
[Mon Nov 22 21:14:32 2004] : <B>Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>He hasn't seen her in a while; she hopes the time lapse is enough to augment her thin disguise.</font><br>
[Mon Nov 22 21:14:47 2004] : <B>Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>If he is stupid enough to call out her <i>name</i>, she is done for.</font><br>
[Mon Nov 22 21:15:33 2004] : <B>Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>The moment he sees you, he does a double take, then goes back to his exercises for a moment before walking around the back of a stable that borders the field.</font><br>
[Mon Nov 22 21:15:44 2004] : <B>Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>She follows at a discreet distance.</font><br>
[Mon Nov 22 21:16:44 2004] : <B>Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>He casts a few glances over his shoulder, seemingly unsure whether to try to shake you; finally, he stops behind a convenient wall of barrels and looks at you quizzically.</font><br>
[Mon Nov 22 21:17:19 2004] : <B>Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>"How long have you had your squire, Sir Lundig?" she asks without preamble. "I am of a mind to hire him away from you."</font><br>
[Mon Nov 22 21:17:37 2004] : <B>Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>"Of course, he is something of a disloyal fellow, so I presume I may have him cheaply."</font><br>
[Mon Nov 22 21:17:59 2004] : <B>Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>"You'd be welcome to him, but he should be well on his way home by now."</font><br>
[Mon Nov 22 21:18:25 2004] : <B>Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>"Oh, indeed?"</font><br>
[Mon Nov 22 21:19:08 2004] : <B>Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>"He came with us to examine the foe and suggest strategies. This is well achieved, and now, to my knowledge, he has gone."</font><br>
[Mon Nov 22 21:19:47 2004] : <B>Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>"We're meeting at a certain place during the duels to study the notes he left behind there."</font><br>
[Mon Nov 22 21:20:25 2004] : <B>Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>"Why do you question his loyalty? His actions seem consistent with the position of drillmaster and mentor."</font><br>
[Mon Nov 22 21:20:54 2004] : <B>Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>"He hasn't gone," Renate declares with absolute certainty. "He should have, but he hasn't. Put the word out. Anyone who sees him needs to collar him and bring him to me."</font><br>
[Mon Nov 22 21:21:11 2004] : <B>Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>"Loyalty? Is it loyalty to lie to one's liege about a journey into enemy lands?"</font><br>
[Mon Nov 22 21:21:12 2004] : <B>Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>"What? What possible motive could he have to stay? Surely he realizes the dangers!"</font><br>
[Mon Nov 22 21:21:50 2004] : <B>Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>"...lie? There is clearly much I am not privy to, and if you will pardon me, I do not wish to be."</font><br>
[Mon Nov 22 21:22:28 2004] : <B>Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>She nods. "Fair enough. You were used, Sir Lundig; you had best watch yourself with that old badger in future. Good day to you, sir, and I thank you for your honesty."</font><br>
[Mon Nov 22 21:23:00 2004] : <B>Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>"Should I remain in this tourney? Will my arms still serve Karlbotel if I do?"</font><br>
[Mon Nov 22 21:23:13 2004] : <B>Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>Sir Lundig has always been a person who prefers to keep the world clear-cut.</font><br>
[Mon Nov 22 21:23:49 2004] : <B>Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>She turns back and smiles, relenting. "Of course. Though if I am granted good fortune, you will not take up arms this day at all. Pray excuse me; I am in haste."</font><br>
[Mon Nov 22 21:24:15 2004] : <B>Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>"I would fain teach these Glenworth curs the might of Karlbotel blades... ah, sorry. Good fortune to you."</font><br>
[Mon Nov 22 21:25:09 2004] : <B>Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>Renate turns toward the fighting-grounds again, her purpose redoubled. <i>Lady Lyria</i>, she prays under her breath, <i>if ever you loved peace, be my friend today, and watch over me.</i></font><br>
[Mon Nov 22 21:26:07 2004] : <B>Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>When she finds someone with the harried air of a functionary, she stops him smoothly with a hand on his elbow. "Is it too late to issue a challenge?" she asks, her Lan'yarian accent back in place.</font><br>
[Mon Nov 22 21:27:13 2004] : <B>Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>"Issue a challenge? Why, certainly you may issue one, but the opponent may discreetly decline."</font><br>
[Mon Nov 22 21:28:07 2004] : <B>Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>"The best way to issue a challenge is to find the opposite party and do so personally and in public. This paperwork is simply a formality."</font><br>
[Mon Nov 22 21:28:38 2004] : <B>Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>"I shall do so, then; may I have the appropriate papers?"</font><br>
[Mon Nov 22 21:28:54 2004] : <B>Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>(Heh. I thought she'd have to send him a note. Cool. This is better.)</font><br>
[Mon Nov 22 21:29:26 2004] : <B>Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>"Ah, hold on, let me get them..." he hurries over to an open-air desk and grabs one up. "Here, a registration paper for a formal duel to the death. I'll sign this ahead of time; the signatures of the combatants make it personal."</font><br>
[Mon Nov 22 21:30:07 2004] : <B>Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>When he hands you the form, for a moment the headline seems to read, <i>Don't Love Peace, Necessarily, Just You.</i></font><br>
[Mon Nov 22 21:30:27 2004] : <B>Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>After a quick blink, it says, <i>Proclamation of Challenge</i>.</font><br>
[Mon Nov 22 21:31:00 2004] : <B>Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>Renate shakes her head and accepts the paper, reading it over quickly to be assured that her challenge cannot be fobbed off on a proxy.</font><br>
[Mon Nov 22 21:32:00 2004] : <B>Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>The contract isn't that complex; it has the obvious spirit-over-letter bias of frontier law.</font><br>
[Mon Nov 22 21:32:24 2004] : <B>Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>Oh, that's fine. That's the only detail that's important to her just at present.</font><br>
[Mon Nov 22 21:32:52 2004] : <B>Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>No reasonable reading could interpret it as anything but "these two people, specifically, will fight to the death using hand-to-hand weapons or their bare hands."</font><br>
[Mon Nov 22 21:33:09 2004] : <B>Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>Excellent. She strides off purposefully toward...</font><br>
[Mon Nov 22 21:33:15 2004] : <B>Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>Anything that strikes at greater than longsword range is out of bounds; other than that, it sounds like anything goes.</font><br>
[Mon Nov 22 21:33:16 2004] : <B>Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>(you do know where I'm going with this by now, right?)</font><br>
[Mon Nov 22 21:33:27 2004] : <B>Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>Oh, I'm guessing.</font><br>
[Mon Nov 22 21:33:52 2004] : <B>Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>... the grounds of Glenworth Manor.</font><br>
[Mon Nov 22 21:34:03 2004] : <B>Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>"Ending the feud" would mean killing Stephen of Glenworth right off the bat.</font><br>
[Mon Nov 22 21:34:06 2004] : <B>Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>Ah, there you go.</font><br>
[Mon Nov 22 21:34:43 2004] : <B>Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>(Heh. You <i>don't</i> know where I'm going with this.)</font><br>
[Mon Nov 22 21:34:47 2004] : <B>Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>(Cool.)</font><br>
[Mon Nov 22 21:34:51 2004] : <B>Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>Then I'll find out.</font><br>
[Mon Nov 22 21:34:55 2004] : <B>Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>(I don't often sneak one past you...)</font><br>
[Mon Nov 22 21:35:01 2004] : <B>Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>So where's our target?</font><br>
[Mon Nov 22 21:35:23 2004] : <B>Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>Well, just challenging and killing the guy doesn't sound like Renate's style at all, so I didn't think that was necessarily it. But I confess I can't guess what she's up to.</font><br>
[Mon Nov 22 21:35:35 2004] : <B>Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>(Excellent! Bring him on, then.)</font><br>
[Mon Nov 22 21:36:05 2004] : <B>Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>Guards cross pikes before you. "State your name and business."</font><br>
[Mon Nov 22 21:36:35 2004] : <B>Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>"Lady Renate von Adler of Karlbotel," she proclaims proudly, "here with a challenge for Stephen of Glenworth."</font><br>
[Mon Nov 22 21:37:02 2004] : <B>Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>One guard looks at the other one. "Were you expecting that, Brun?"</font><br>
[Mon Nov 22 21:37:07 2004] : <B>Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>"No. No, I honestly was not."</font><br>

[Mon Nov 22 21:37:57 2004] : <B>Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>"I will wait," she says obligingly.</font><br>
[Mon Nov 22 21:38:00 2004] : <B>Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>Brun shrugs. "Right. If she tries to steal the silverware, I'll collar her in a flash."</font><br>

[Mon Nov 22 21:38:56 2004] : <B>Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>"Sorry," she murmurs, momentarily coldly amused.</font><br>
[Mon Nov 22 21:39:39 2004] : <B>Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>He comes back out in a moment with someone considerably more official-looking; a dignified old man with the fringed robes of the Silver Coast diplomatic corps.</font><br>
[Mon Nov 22 21:40:36 2004] : <B>Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>This must be Gadon Chambourne, Glenworth's "prime minister," to the extent that such a small area needs one.</font><br>
[Mon Nov 22 21:40:45 2004] : <font color='#008000'>** Renate bows with all appropriate courtesy. **</font><br>
[Mon Nov 22 21:41:00 2004] : <B>Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>Your father has often spoken of his alternately as the only honorable man in a den of thieves, and the only competent thief in a den of fools.</font><br>
[Mon Nov 22 21:41:23 2004] : <B>Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>To the extent that Glenworth is any conventional threat, it's because of Chambourne.</font><br>
[Mon Nov 22 21:41:49 2004] : <B>Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>"Oh my stars. It really is. My lady, what under the sun are you doing here? You must leave at once!"</font><br>
[Mon Nov 22 21:42:01 2004] : <B>Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>He seems aghast to see you.</font><br>
[Mon Nov 22 21:42:02 2004] : <B>Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>"I must do nothing of the kind, Master Chambourne."</font><br>
[Mon Nov 22 21:42:19 2004] : <B>Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>"I am here, as has no doubt been told you, with a challenge for the Baron."</font><br>
[Mon Nov 22 21:42:19 2004] : <B>Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>"Then clearly I value your life more than you value it yourself!"</font><br>
[Mon Nov 22 21:42:29 2004] : <B>Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>"As may be."</font><br>
[Mon Nov 22 21:43:23 2004] : <B>Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>Chambourne claps his hand to his forehead. "I hoped it was a... I don't know what I hoped. Are you really here to just fight him and have done with it?"</font><br>
[Mon Nov 22 21:43:33 2004] : <B>Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>"Because I don't know that I can allow that. He is my... responsibility."</font><br>
[Mon Nov 22 21:44:55 2004] : <B>Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>"I am here to have done with it, yes." She takes off her sunglasses and looks the old man in the eye; her face is sad, rather than angry, and determined. "You need to trust me, Master Chambourne. I am my father's daughter, but I am also Ilium's guardian. You need to trust me; I swear to you, you will not regret it."</font><br>
[Mon Nov 22 21:46:05 2004] : <B>Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>Chambourne shakes his head as if to clear it. "Our motives are unlikely to be the same. I am sworn to do what is best for Stephen; and <i>not</i> in some sense of tragic resolution."</font><br>
[Mon Nov 22 21:46:29 2004] : <B>Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>"Then it is best to leave him to his madness?"</font><br>
[Mon Nov 22 21:46:51 2004] : <B>Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>"It is best to struggle, day by day, to teach him."</font><br>
[Mon Nov 22 21:47:04 2004] : <B>Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>"Let me help, then. Please."</font><br>
[Mon Nov 22 21:47:33 2004] : <B>Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>"Help? Then you propose something more constructive than bloodshed? A funny way to do it."</font><br>

[Mon Nov 22 21:48:38 2004] : <B>Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>"There is more to this than I can tell you. I see no other way forward. Come, it is hope I offer you; will you not take it? Am I so unworthy of a good man's trust?"</font><br>
[Mon Nov 22 21:52:32 2004] : <B>Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>The prime minister looks to the heavens for inspiration. Finally: "I have heard much news of you. You are generous to a fault; but you can kill those you consider evil or irredeemable without hesitation."</font><br>
[Mon Nov 22 21:52:50 2004] : <B>Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>"But I cannot imagine you capable of premeditated murder."</font><br>
[Mon Nov 22 21:53:07 2004] : <B>Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>"Bold though Stephen is, you must realize that a fair duel would be such a murder."</font><br>
[Mon Nov 22 21:53:18 2004] : <B>Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>"I realize."</font><br>
[Mon Nov 22 21:53:29 2004] : <B>Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>"With that understanding... I shall deliver your challenge. I am certain he will accept."</font><br>
[Mon Nov 22 21:54:04 2004] : <B>Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>"I expect he will. Thank you, Master Chambourne. I am honoured to have met you." She hands over the challenge without delay.</font><br>
[Mon Nov 22 21:55:04 2004] : <B>Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>"Are you aware that Aaron Wrenfall is in the town? Our esteemed guests reported this to me, with the suggestion that if he were to depart immediately, much awkwardness could be avoided."</font><br>
[Mon Nov 22 21:55:42 2004] : <B>Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>"I am aware. I agree with the suggestion; I am simply not at all sanguine that it can be carried out."</font><br>
[Mon Nov 22 21:56:09 2004] : <B>Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>"If the Baron will meet me first of all, perhaps the awkwardness will have no opportunity to occur."</font><br>
[Mon Nov 22 21:56:16 2004] : <B>Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>"Then he is beyond your control. It relieves me to know that you know some of my pain."</font><br>
[Mon Nov 22 21:57:06 2004] : <B>Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>She takes his shoulders in her strong young hands. "Don't worry. This is for the best. For the Baron, for his people -- for mine, for <i>ours</i>."</font><br>
[Mon Nov 22 21:58:06 2004] : <B>Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>"Ours? A delightful coda to a thrilling conversation," Chambourne says, milking the maximum ironic misinterpretation out of your statement.</font><br>
[Mon Nov 22 21:58:27 2004] : <B>Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>"I shall arrange matters. By all means, take your ease in the town."</font><br>
[Mon Nov 22 21:58:52 2004] : <B>Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>"Thank you, sir; I shall. Good day, then."</font><br>
[Mon Nov 22 22:00:15 2004] : <B>Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>Relieved, serene, she glides away. Her course is set; nothing can move it. Now she only has to wait. She starts adjusting the buckles of her arms and armor as she goes.</font><br>
[Mon Nov 22 22:01:36 2004] : <B>Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>Are you dropping the disguise?</font><br>
[Mon Nov 22 22:01:43 2004] : <B>Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>Nobody here would necessarily recognize you anyway.</font><br>
[Mon Nov 22 22:02:22 2004] : <B>Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>Eh, no, leave it on. No point in getting accosted before the official scrum.</font><br>
[Mon Nov 22 22:02:29 2004] : <B>Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>Word will pass anyway; those guards seemed gossipy.</font><br>
[Mon Nov 22 22:02:56 2004] : <B>Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>Within a half-hour, the town is abuzz with the news that the heir to Karlbotel will be facing off with the ruler of Glenworth on the field of honor.</font><br>
[Mon Nov 22 22:03:09 2004] : <B>Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>(brb, phone from girl)</font><br>
[Mon Nov 22 22:03:24 2004] : <B>Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>Renate rolls her eyes. She is <i>not</i> the heir; Baron Rainer has not named his heir.</font><br>
[Mon Nov 22 22:03:43 2004] : <B>Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>This is not, however, the time to discuss the fine points of Karlbotel succession. Especially not with the Rolling Jinx in town.</font><br>
[Mon Nov 22 22:07:38 2004] : <B>Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>Renate finds an out-of-the-way place to wait, this not being a good time to run into Coris or Lundig either.</font><br>
[Mon Nov 22 22:13:07 2004] : <B>Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>(Okay, back. Sorry about that.)</font><br>
[Mon Nov 22 22:13:10 2004] : <B>Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>(She had a bad day.)</font><br>
[Mon Nov 22 22:13:24 2004] : <B>Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>(I'm sorry. Hope tomorrow is better.)</font><br>
[Mon Nov 22 22:14:11 2004] : <B>Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>So, the new tournament schedule is "duel of the century" followed by "feasting and rejoicing and/or moping around confused."</font><br>
[Mon Nov 22 22:14:14 2004] : <B>Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>Depending on who wins.</font><br>
[Mon Nov 22 22:14:25 2004] : <B>Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>(Something like that.)</font><br>
[Mon Nov 22 22:14:41 2004] : <B>Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>(You still seem to have no notion where I'm going, which is curious indeed, as I thought I was being incredibly obvious about it.)</font><br>
[Mon Nov 22 22:15:04 2004] : <B>Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>(I'm probably just off my game.)</font><br>
[Mon Nov 22 22:15:37 2004] : <B>Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>(The only hunches I have are very wild.)</font><br>
[Mon Nov 22 22:15:46 2004] : <B>Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>(Like, if she asks him to marry her, or something.)</font><br>
[Mon Nov 22 22:16:09 2004] : <B>Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>(Well, if she thought it would work...)</font><br>
[Mon Nov 22 22:16:24 2004] : <B>Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>(Probably wouldn't go over too well with him.)</font><br>
[Mon Nov 22 22:16:49 2004] : <B>Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>(Anyway, I'll just find out the hard way.)</font><br>
[Mon Nov 22 22:16:51 2004] : <B>Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>(See, that's the problem.)</font><br>
[Mon Nov 22 22:17:19 2004] : <B>Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>(Ah, was I supposed to be planning for Renate's mysterious action by this point?)</font><br>
[Mon Nov 22 22:17:51 2004] : <B>Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>(Nah. I surprised you; I'm happy; we'll run with it, see where it goes.)</font><br>
[Mon Nov 22 22:18:12 2004] : <B>Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>(I don't know where it's going. It could go somewhere very ugly. I wasn't kidding when I said this was a Hail Mary pass.)</font><br>
[Mon Nov 22 22:18:36 2004] : <B>Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>(Or, shall we say, Hail Lyria.)</font><br>
[Mon Nov 22 22:19:02 2004] : <B>Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>The original plan was that the tourney would start with jesters and mock duels between midgets and so forth, to get the audience cheering, but the stands are packed already: a spectacle like this doesn't happen every day.</font><br>
[Mon Nov 22 22:19:48 2004] : <B>Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>You have to duck around a few times to avoid Coris and his people, who are hunting through the crowds feverishly.</font><br>
[Mon Nov 22 22:20:22 2004] : <B>Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>Once she gets into the lists, they won't be able to get to her.</font><br>
[Mon Nov 22 22:20:53 2004] : <B>Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>(One nice thing about this move&#8212;it blows Aaron's plan entirely out of the water.)</font><br>
[Mon Nov 22 22:20:54 2004] : <B>Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>Coris, she thinks, might know what she has in mind.</font><br>
[Mon Nov 22 22:20:59 2004] : <B>Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>(THAT WAS THE IDEA.)</font><br>
[Mon Nov 22 22:21:10 2004] : <B>Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>(Well, yes.)</font><br>
[Mon Nov 22 22:21:49 2004] : <B>Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>She checks her sword-belt and lasso-clip again. They are as she wants them.</font><br>
[Mon Nov 22 22:22:08 2004] : <B>Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>A herald marches a noble white charger into the center of the field, and reads off a flowering load of rubbish, clearly written hastily and in a deep shade of purple, about the clash of nations and the rule of the strongest.</font><br>
[Mon Nov 22 22:22:46 2004] : <B>Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'><i>Hmph. We'll see about that.</i></font><br>
[Mon Nov 22 22:23:04 2004] : <B>Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>"And taking the field, to await his noble adversary, is his lordship, Baron Stephen Glenworth!"</font><br>
[Mon Nov 22 22:23:25 2004] : <B>Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>She unknots the kerchief from her hair and lets it fall. She takes off her sunglasses and stows them in her belt-pouch.</font><br>
[Mon Nov 22 22:24:16 2004] : <B>Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>Whatever his emotional issues, Stephen of Glenworth is physically impressive, with clean, aristocratic features, long flowing hair, and broad shoulders.</font><br>
[Mon Nov 22 22:24:52 2004] : <B>Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>He strides into the field dressed in battered but well-maintained plate; either someone convinced him not to wear ceremonial armor, or he has at least a little real experience.</font><br>
[Mon Nov 22 22:24:54 2004] : <B>Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>Renate feels a little frisson. <i>A pity he must be mad,</i> she thinks. <i>He would stand up well with Sabine.</i></font><br>
[Mon Nov 22 22:25:36 2004] : <B>Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>A mace, a longsword, two daggers, and twin mastercraft potion gauntlets form his gear.</font><br>
[Mon Nov 22 22:25:55 2004] : <B>Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>Loaded for bear, though it is only a wren that opposes him.</font><br>
[Mon Nov 22 22:26:11 2004] : <B>Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>(He would have a helmet, but the rules of D&D and assorted source material militate against one. :)</font><br>
[Mon Nov 22 22:26:13 2004] : <B>Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>Such fear. So unnecessary. Why did it have to come to this?</font><br>
[Mon Nov 22 22:27:16 2004] : <B>Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>She scans the crowd, looking for Coris and his people. She hopes they are not there; better they should not see this.</font><br>
[Mon Nov 22 22:27:44 2004] : <B>Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>Chambourne, too; she would smile at him again, if she knew where he was.</font><br>

[Mon Nov 22 22:28:39 2004] : <B>Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>Poya Kern is evident as much by her angry glare as by her epaulette of rank.</font><br>
[Mon Nov 22 22:29:07 2004] : <B>Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>Poya Kern can eat her own sword; if this goes as Renate wishes, it is all the sustenance Glenworth will give her, now or ever.</font><br>
[Mon Nov 22 22:29:52 2004] : <B>Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>Renate stops, a little over a swords-length away, and bows. "My lord of Glenworth."</font><br>
[Mon Nov 22 22:29:57 2004] : <B>Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>Stephen of Glenworth tightens his shield strap, unhooks the mace from his belt, and stands ready. "I do not know why you have come here, woman, but I will not stand by cowardly in the face of your insolence."</font><br>
[Mon Nov 22 22:30:33 2004] : <B>Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>"No more you should, my lord," she says. She moves her hand, and her sword in its scabbard drops to the ground behind her.</font><br>
[Mon Nov 22 22:31:17 2004] : <B>Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>Her other hand sends her lasso slithering from its clip to splash into the muddied earth.</font><br>

[Mon Nov 22 22:32:02 2004] : <B>Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>"Then it is you who are the coward," Stephen says, almost barking a laugh.</font><br>
[Mon Nov 22 22:32:17 2004] : <B>Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>He doesn't seem inclined to strike you down in cold blood, at least.</font><br>
[Mon Nov 22 22:33:32 2004] : <B>Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>"Wrong was done you," she says. "I acknowledge it, and I tender my regret that it should have been so. My challenge to you, my lord, is to accept redress at last, for your own sake and the sake of your people."</font><br>

[Mon Nov 22 22:37:07 2004] : <B>Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>The audience cheers enthusiastically in response; whether cheering their ruler or just cheering for bloodshed isn't clear. There are many out-of-towners.</font><br>
[Mon Nov 22 22:37:55 2004] : <B>Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>Renate stands grave and still, her eyes on his, waiting for him to decide her life.</font><br>

[Mon Nov 22 22:38:27 2004] : <B>Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>With each sentence, the audience cheers louder. Either they already agree with him, or he knows how to play them.</font><br>
[Mon Nov 22 22:39:41 2004] : <B>Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>"We are at war with them; our hunters shoot at each other in the disputed forests. Their diplomats lobby for sanctions against us; our raiders returns sanctions in kind, if not in quality."</font><br>

[Mon Nov 22 22:42:27 2004] : <B>Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>The crowd seems to like the idea of wandering into Karlbotel and looting a nonresisting populace; or at least, they're jeering you pretty roundly.</font><br>
[Mon Nov 22 22:43:46 2004] : <B>Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>Renate waits for the din to die back a bit before she answers. "My nation is Ilium, though I do not rule there," she says. "And if you would finally be welcomed there, I will do my utmost to see you joined to it."</font><br>
[Mon Nov 22 22:44:33 2004] : <B>Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>Stephen laughs again. "Then know this, and shudder: there is another nation we could be welcomed in."</font><br>
[Mon Nov 22 22:44:45 2004] : <B>Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>"Against which the prosperity of Ilium is nothing!"</font><br>

[Mon Nov 22 22:45:08 2004] : <B>Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>Poya absently pats him on the shoulder.</font><br>
[Mon Nov 22 22:45:53 2004] : <B>Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>"I know. Do you think me blind, Stephen of Glenworth? Ask yourself, though, ask yourself this: what will happen to you at their hands when we no longer remain?"</font><br>
[Mon Nov 22 22:47:29 2004] : <B>Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>"I long for revenge for my people; I long for the prosperity of my people. Both will occur! What do I care what happens to me then?"</font><br>
[Mon Nov 22 22:48:45 2004] : <B>Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>"Your people do not want revenge, or I should never have made it to these lists unharmed. And prosperity they have, and could have more, if you would let them. No, my lord, this is between you and me, and I should like it settled."</font><br>
[Mon Nov 22 22:49:42 2004] : <B>Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>"Then take up that sword, and have at you! Or be shipped home in chains!"</font><br>
[Mon Nov 22 22:50:14 2004] : <B>Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>"I will not add to the wrong that was done you; that was never my intent. Kill me, and take back your due."</font><br>
[Mon Nov 22 22:51:24 2004] : <B>Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>"So be it; let this humiliation stand as notice of your family's worthlessness!"</font><br>
[Mon Nov 22 22:51:35 2004] : <B>Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>"Guards! Bind her and send her home!"</font><br>
[Mon Nov 22 22:51:44 2004] : <B>Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>Poya Kern stands forward. "Lord Stephen."</font><br>
[Mon Nov 22 22:51:56 2004] : <B>Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>"As a personal favor, do allow her to leave under her own power."</font><br>
[Mon Nov 22 22:52:54 2004] : <B>Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>"Very well then," Stephen says, relenting.</font><br>
[Mon Nov 22 22:53:08 2004] : <B>Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>"Begone; or stand there like an axed mule. I care not."</font><br>
[Mon Nov 22 22:53:16 2004] : <B>Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>Stephen stalks away, red-faced.</font><br>
[Mon Nov 22 22:53:23 2004] : <B>Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>(brb, girl's here).</font><br>

[Mon Nov 22 22:54:35 2004] : <B>Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>She is indeed Coris's sister; the resemblance is as remarkable as that between Renate herself and Emil.</font><br>
[Mon Nov 22 22:58:26 2004] : <B>Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>Was it Poya's two decades as a Heaven agent that gave her an aura of fire? Or was controlled anger always her demeanor?</font><br>
