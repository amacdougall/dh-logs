[Sat Dec 27 00:06:14 2008] : <b>(20297) Aryk</b>: <font color='#710000'>Yeah, not too hot on the "roe" personally.</font><br />

[Sat Dec 27 00:11:26 2008] : <b>(20296) Alan</b>: <font color='#000080'>I love how the tactical map, even as it looks like a hand-drawn WW2-era map with little zone labels and things, actually IS the main map, with a different renderer.</font><br />
[Sat Dec 27 00:11:48 2008] : <b>(20296) Alan</b>: <font color='#000080'>It's a beautiful effect. It's like you're going "into" the world of the map every time you look down at the battle.</font><br />
[Sat Dec 27 00:12:00 2008] : <b>(20297) Aryk</b>: <font color='#710000'>Yeah, that game looks like a lot of fun.  I put more time into Front Mission on the PS1 than any other game, and I get the same vibe from this game that I got from that.</font><br />
[Sat Dec 27 00:12:12 2008] : <b>(20294) Rien</b>: <font color='#003300'>I've been playing the hell out of the new Prince of Persia, Crysis, Farcry 2 and Assassin's Creed, which I borrowed from a friend.</font><br />

[Sat Dec 27 00:15:39 2008] : <b>(20297) Aryk</b>: <font color='#710000'>Yeah but in Assassin's Creed you can spook a horse and send it off into a crowd.</font><br />
[Sat Dec 27 00:15:46 2008] : <b>(20296) Alan</b>: <font color='#000080'>Trust me. It's a rental.</font><br />

I only know that he broke into my house, woke me from a good sleep, and demanded I come with him to serve him at good pay, or come with him for no pay and leave my head behind on the nightstand."</font><br />

[Sat Dec 27 03:28:04 2008] : <b>(20296) Alan</b>: <font color='#000080'>You did say "what do you know of the Seven Immortal Sages", though.</font><br />
[Sat Dec 27 03:28:10 2008] : <b>(20296) Alan</b>: <font color='#000080'>And he said "them all."</font><br />
[Sat Dec 27 03:28:12 2008] : <b>(20298) Renate</b>: <font color='#000080'>a perhaps more interesting question is "why is the time to kill them all not now?"</font><br />
[Sat Dec 27 03:28:17 2008] : <b>(20297) Aryk</b>: <font color='#710000'>Next time bring Aryk with you.  </font><br />
[Sat Dec 27 03:28:50 2008] : <b>(20296) Alan</b>: <font color='#000080'>Ander, in the Zion game, had already disposed of them at this point; but then, he also had a love affair with Cecilia Faris, so things were definitely a lot different.</font><br />
[Sat Dec 27 03:29:29 2008] : <b>(20294) Rien</b>: <font color='#003300'>I think it would have been interesting to see him have a lover affair with the Noble Son/Daughter character</font><br />
[Sat Dec 27 03:29:44 2008] : <b>(20294) Rien</b>: <font color='#003300'>Also, how close is the Ander we know and distrust in this game to the Ander from the Zion game?</font><br />
[Sat Dec 27 03:29:54 2008] : <b>(20296) Alan</b>: <font color='#000080'>Hah, Ander Kurtzveil and hulking tanklike hobgoblin!</font><br />
[Sat Dec 27 03:30:05 2008] : <b>(20298) Renate</b>: <font color='#000080'>the slash practically writes itself!</font><br />
[Sat Dec 27 03:30:39 2008] : <b>(20296) Alan</b>: <font color='#000080'>Quite close. Justin's Ander was removed enough from humanity that he a) went for Cecilia Faris <i>because</i> of her depression and alienation -- he sensed a kindred spirit.</font><br />
[Sat Dec 27 03:31:10 2008] : <b>(20296) Alan</b>: <font color='#000080'>And b) he joined Dark Eternal despite considering him "sick, and never going to get better."</font><br />
[Sat Dec 27 03:31:31 2008] : <b>(20296) Alan</b>: <font color='#000080'>A lot like Luke surrendering himself to Vader for an audience with the Emperor, in fact.</font><br />
[Sat Dec 27 03:31:41 2008] : <b>(20296) Alan</b>: <font color='#000080'>Knowing it was a bad idea, but knowing it was the only way to get the answers he needed.</font><br />
[Sat Dec 27 03:32:14 2008] : <b>(20294) Rien</b>: <font color='#003300'>Man, he's nothing like Rien, then.</font><br />
[Sat Dec 27 03:33:04 2008] : <b>(20296) Alan</b>: <font color='#000080'>Well, his idea was someone alien, who was doomed to stay that way.</font><br />
[Sat Dec 27 03:33:36 2008] : <b>(20294) Rien</b>: <font color='#003300'>Rien, apart from the whole being in love thing, hopes to teach Renate how worth it she is.  And he'd never join DE, even if it meant he never found out all about himself.  He'd rather die.</font><br />
[Sat Dec 27 03:34:06 2008] : <b>(20298) Renate</b>: <font color='#000080'>Renate is perfectly well aware that when Rien goes dragonrank she loses him, thank you very much.</font><br />
[Sat Dec 27 03:34:44 2008] : <b>(20294) Rien</b>: <font color='#003300'>Well, he hasn't apparently aged at all since anyone's known him, so who knows how long he would have lived, even sans Dragonrank?</font><br />
[Sat Dec 27 03:35:10 2008] : <b>(20296) Alan</b>: <font color='#000080'>Hey. A talk about Chinese-American food. Check out the part early on where she gives fortune cookies to a bunch of Chinese people and they go "what is this?" <a href="http://www.ted.com/index.php/talks/jennifer_8_lee_looks_for_general_tso.html">link</a></font><br />
[Sat Dec 27 03:35:22 2008] : <b>(20296) Alan</b>: <font color='#000080'>Around 1:30ish.</font><br />
[Sat Dec 27 03:35:44 2008] : <b>(20296) Alan</b>: <font color='#000080'>One says "You won a prize!"</font><br />
[Sat Dec 27 03:36:21 2008] : <b>(20298) Renate</b>: <font color='#000080'>That's not the issue. The issue is, dragons don't love humans. A human is never more than a pawn to a dragon. So it goes.</font><br />
[Sat Dec 27 03:37:04 2008] : <b>(20296) Alan</b>: <font color='#000080'>Rainstone would be a guy to talk to about that.</font><br />
[Sat Dec 27 03:37:15 2008] : <b>(20296) Alan</b>: <font color='#000080'>Maybe he views humans as his pawns in his quest for democracy!</font><br />
[Sat Dec 27 03:37:26 2008] : <b>(20296) Alan</b>: <font color='#000080'>"Can't have democracy without humans. Necessary evil!"</font><br />
[Sat Dec 27 03:38:06 2008] : <b>(20294) Rien</b>: <font color='#003300'>And as we've discussed before, D, everything's gotta start somewhere.</font><br />
[Sat Dec 27 03:38:19 2008] : <b>(20297) Aryk</b>: <font color='#710000'>bed now.  good.  same next week?</font><br />
[Sat Dec 27 03:38:36 2008] : <b>(20298) Renate</b>: <font color='#000080'>I assume so.</font><br />
[Sat Dec 27 03:38:38 2008] : <b>(20296) Alan</b>: <font color='#000080'>Sure thing.</font><br />
[Sat Dec 27 03:38:39 2008] : <b>(20298) Renate</b>: <font color='#000080'>g'night!</font><br />
[Sat Dec 27 03:38:51 2008] : <b>(20297) Aryk</b>: <font color='#710000'>K.  Goodnight?</font><br />
[Sat Dec 27 03:39:00 2008] : <font color='#ff0000'>Disconnecting from server...</font><br />
