[Sat Jul 24 20:00:33 2004] : <B>Rien</B>: <font color='#804040'>So Sabine's going to watch Renate's mind to see if she's compensating, and Trancey'll do some observing of his own.</font><br>
[Sat Jul 24 20:00:47 2004] : <B>Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>Something like that. Maybe.</font><br>

[Sat Jul 24 20:01:47 2004] : <font color='#008000'>** Rien walked through the mian corridor of the Manor, hoping to spot Sabine **</font><br>
[Sat Jul 24 20:02:19 2004] : <B>Sabine</B>: <font color='#000080'>He heard her voice in a nearby room, chatting quietly with Godfrey.</font><br>
[Sat Jul 24 20:02:44 2004] : <B>Rien</B>: <font color='#804040'>Appearing around the door, he knocked softly and waited</font><br>
[Sat Jul 24 20:03:09 2004] : <B>Sabine</B>: <font color='#000080'>"Come in!"</font><br>
[Sat Jul 24 20:03:42 2004] : <B>Rien</B>: <font color='#804040'>"Good morning lady Sabine, Godfrey." Rien said bowing slightly to each in turn.</font><br>
[Sat Jul 24 20:04:09 2004] : <B>Sabine</B>: <font color='#000080'>"Good morning, Master Rien," from Sabine, and "Good morning, sir," from Godfrey.</font><br>
[Sat Jul 24 20:04:45 2004] : <B>Sabine</B>: <font color='#000080'>Godfrey, sensing the situation as only he can, bows himself out of the room without fuss, leaving the door open behind him.</font><br>
[Sat Jul 24 20:05:19 2004] : <B>Sabine</B>: <font color='#000080'>"Well, what can I do for you?" Sabine asked. "Any ill-effects from our ale?"</font><br>
[Sat Jul 24 20:05:53 2004] : <B>Rien</B>: <font color='#804040'>"None whatever, my lady.  I do not drink, so it did not affect me in the least.  Aryk on the other hand...."</font><br>
[Sat Jul 24 20:06:31 2004] : <B>Sabine</B>: <font color='#000080'>Sabine smiled. "Didn't show up to breakfast this morning, no. Godfrey will look in on him, just to be sure."</font><br>
[Sat Jul 24 20:06:57 2004] : <B>Rien</B>: <font color='#804040'>"Good.  He is prone to hangovers, so alot of water will be called for, I think."</font><br>
[Sat Jul 24 20:07:50 2004] : <B>Rien</B>: <font color='#804040'>"I believe Renate has just gone out to the archery range.  I was wondering if we could take this opportunity for you to observe her to make sure I'm just being paranoid about her vision?"</font><br>
[Sat Jul 24 20:07:52 2004] : <B>Sabine</B>: <font color='#000080'>"Godfrey has his ways."</font><br>
[Sat Jul 24 20:08:49 2004] : <B>Sabine</B>: <font color='#000080'>"Ah. Yes, I suppose that might do... she might be a little less stubborn if it's both of us. Give me a moment to find my shoes, and we'll go."</font><br>
[Sat Jul 24 20:09:01 2004] : <font color='#008000'>** Rien bowed again **</font><br>
[Sat Jul 24 20:09:28 2004] : <B>Sabine</B>: <font color='#000080'>Sabine changed her cloth house-slippers at the door for a proper pair of boots, and led the way into the hazy summer morning.</font><br>
[Sat Jul 24 20:09:50 2004] : <B>Sabine</B>: <font color='#000080'>"If she didn't take a canteen with her, I'll kill her myself," she remarked to Rien.</font><br>
[Sat Jul 24 20:11:19 2004] : <B>Rien</B>: <font color='#804040'>"Indeed."</font><br>
[Sat Jul 24 20:12:45 2004] : <B>Sabine</B>: <font color='#000080'>They passed Renate's balance beam and climbing gym. Sabine waved to Aaron in the tiltyard; he waved back.</font><br>
[Sat Jul 24 20:13:24 2004] : <font color='#008000'>** Rien nods as they go past **</font><br>
[Sat Jul 24 20:13:59 2004] : <B>Rien</B>: <font color='#804040'>"my silent friend up here," Rien taps his forehead, "will no doubt be watching too."</font><br>
[Sat Jul 24 20:14:22 2004] : <B>Sabine</B>: <font color='#000080'>"Odd," Sabine said, not in reply to Rien. "We're close enough we ought to be hearing the shots. Oh, well, maybe she's just picking up arrows."</font><br>
[Sat Jul 24 20:15:09 2004] : <font color='#008000'>** Rien raises an eyebrow **</font><br>
[Sat Jul 24 20:15:59 2004] : <B>Sabine</B>: <font color='#000080'>Another noise struck their ears, then, as different from the clean twang of a bowstring as could be imagined: a puppy's high, insistent whimpering.</font><br>
[Sat Jul 24 20:16:45 2004] : <font color='#008000'>** Rien stops in his tracks, turning his head from side to side, fixing on the direction of the sound, then breaks into a run **</font><br>
[Sat Jul 24 20:16:59 2004] : <B>Sabine</B>: <font color='#000080'>"Uh-oh," Sabine said, picking up her skirts and running after him.</font><br>
[Sat Jul 24 20:18:58 2004] : <B>Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>Renate was sitting on one of the haybales that separated the range from the rest of the grounds, her knees drawn up and her head buried in her arms. Dorothy sprawled beside her, crying, one paw brushing at her trouser leg.</font><br>
[Sat Jul 24 20:19:29 2004] : <B>Rien</B>: <font color='#804040'>"Renate!"</font><br>
[Sat Jul 24 20:19:52 2004] : <B>Sabine</B>: <font color='#000080'>"Jenny-Wren, what's wrong?"</font><br>
[Sat Jul 24 20:20:59 2004] : <font color='#008000'>** Renate looked up, and fairly made to flee. She almost sent poor Dorothy off the bale as she jumped down from it. **</font><br>
[Sat Jul 24 20:22:54 2004] : <B>Rien</B>: <font color='#804040'>As she ran off, Rien's sword appeared in his hand, and he sliced into the mirror realm, flashing out and appearing in front of Renate, catching her in his arms.</font><br>
[Sat Jul 24 20:23:07 2004] : <B>Trancey Rien</B>: <font color='#804040'>"Careful now.  We only want to talk."</font><br>
[Sat Jul 24 20:23:26 2004] : <B>Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>"Ow! Rien, let go! Just -- oh, forget it."</font><br>
[Sat Jul 24 20:23:32 2004] : <B>Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>"Go away."</font><br>
[Sat Jul 24 20:24:11 2004] : <font color='#008000'>** Sabine shook her head, and gestured for Rien to leave off his hold. **</font><br>
[Sat Jul 24 20:24:41 2004] : <font color='#008000'>** Trancey Rien gives Renate *the* look, then releases her, and his eyes fade again **</font><br>
[Sat Jul 24 20:24:56 2004] : <B>Sabine</B>: <font color='#000080'>"Jenny-Wren," she said, with all a sister's affection, "it's all right. Promise, sis."</font><br>
[Sat Jul 24 20:25:29 2004] : <B>Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>"Great," Renate spat, looking up. "Rien? Can you hear me? You'd better sit down."</font><br>
[Sat Jul 24 20:25:46 2004] : <B>Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>"Stupid Trancey, never <i>will</i> leave well enough alone..."</font><br>
[Sat Jul 24 20:25:54 2004] : <font color='#008000'>** Rien swallowed **</font><br>
[Sat Jul 24 20:26:02 2004] : <B>Rien</B>: <font color='#804040'>"I'm fine.  Why did you try and run away?"</font><br>
[Sat Jul 24 20:26:34 2004] : <B>Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>"Sit <i>down</i>, Rien."</font><br>
[Sat Jul 24 20:26:48 2004] : <B>Rien</B>: <font color='#804040'>"OK...ok..."</font><br>
[Sat Jul 24 20:27:03 2004] : <font color='#008000'>** Rien sits, and drags her down next to him **</font><br>
[Sat Jul 24 20:27:39 2004] : <B>Sabine</B>: <font color='#000080'>Sabine seated herself on Renate's other side in a flutter of long skirts.</font><br>
[Sat Jul 24 20:29:05 2004] : <B>Rien</B>: <font color='#804040'>'Now...what's with the running away?  You know I'm the one who's supposed to run from you." Rien says with a lopsided grin.</font><br>
[Sat Jul 24 20:29:48 2004] : <B>Sabine</B>: <font color='#000080'>Dorothy jumped down from the hay-bale, landing puppyishly badly. No whit the worse, she ambled over to join the conclave.</font><br>
[Sat Jul 24 20:31:16 2004] : <B>Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>"I'm just -- mad at myself. Look." She threw out one hand toward the targets; blunt-tipped arrows were sprayed in nearly every direction but the most profitable one. "I could shoot better than this when I was nine!"</font><br>
[Sat Jul 24 20:31:32 2004] : <font color='#008000'>** Rien picks up Dorothy and deopisits her in Renate's lap **</font><br>
[Sat Jul 24 20:32:30 2004] : <font color='#008000'>** Renate gathered her wriggling little body up and held her, getting thoroughly licked for her pains. **</font><br>
[Sat Jul 24 20:33:02 2004] : <font color='#008000'>** Rien strokes Reante's blonde head **</font><br>
[Sat Jul 24 20:33:19 2004] : <B>Rien</B>: <font color='#804040'>"Oh Renate...I knew something like this might be happening."</font><br>
[Sat Jul 24 20:33:42 2004] : <B>Sabine</B>: <font color='#000080'>"He came to me almost a week ago," Sabine confirmed.</font><br>
[Sat Jul 24 20:35:01 2004] : <B>Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>"Oh. Damn. Then you know I'm going b-blind." The final word is a whisper into Dorothy's short bristly fur.</font><br>
[Sat Jul 24 20:35:34 2004] : <font color='#008000'>** Rien is silent a moment **</font><br>
[Sat Jul 24 20:35:37 2004] : <B>Rien</B>: <font color='#804040'>"Yes."</font><br>
[Sat Jul 24 20:36:26 2004] : <B>Sabine</B>: <font color='#000080'>"Jenny-Wren," Sabine interjected. "We don't know that yet."</font><br>
[Sat Jul 24 20:36:48 2004] : <B>Rien</B>: <font color='#804040'>"Nothing is set in stone."</font><br>
[Sat Jul 24 20:37:17 2004] : <B>Sabine</B>: <font color='#000080'>Sabine put her arm around her sister's shoulders. "Suppose you tell us when this started, and what it's like."</font><br>
[Sat Jul 24 20:37:59 2004] : <B>Sabine</B>: <font color='#000080'>"I'm not sure when," Renate said dully. "Everything seems like it could be -- I keep turning up the lamp to read or write letters or whatever, but when I do I get these really awful headaches. And when I go outside in the sun, it seems like everything's too bright to focus on, but when I come in I can't see hardly at all for ten or fifteen minutes."</font><br>
[Sat Jul 24 20:38:40 2004] : <B>Sabine</B>: <font color='#000080'>"And yesterday, Aaron's stupid trip rope -- I should have seen it. I didn't. It was right there, and I didn't see it. Aaron said he was going to have to work on my eye, and I came out here today to prove he was wrong, and I -- I couldn't pretend it wasn't happening any more."</font><br>
[Sat Jul 24 20:39:12 2004] : <B>Rien</B>: <font color='#804040'>"Yet that afternoon in the darkened Temple of Michael you could tell me how many fingers I was holding up.  Was that just a lucky guess?"</font><br>
[Sat Jul 24 20:39:51 2004] : <font color='#008000'>** Renate didn't answer, staring bleakly at the space between Dorothy's perked-up ears. **</font><br>
[Sat Jul 24 20:40:10 2004] : <B>Rien</B>: <font color='#804040'>"I don't think it was."</font><br>
[Sat Jul 24 20:40:14 2004] : <font color='#008000'>** Sabine grimaced, and motioned to Rien to be still. **</font><br>
[Sat Jul 24 20:40:52 2004] : <B>Sabine</B>: <font color='#000080'>"Rennie," she said gently. "How long has this been going on? Have you tried to do anything about it?"</font><br>
[Sat Jul 24 20:41:20 2004] : <B>Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>"I've been getting headaches so long I'm not even sure it's related, really. The light stuff -- I don't know, maybe four or five months? And I didn't notice I was starting not to see until a little before I came home. Though maybe I've just been fooling myself. God, Sabine, I'm -- I'm really scared now."</font><br>
[Sat Jul 24 20:43:57 2004] : <B>Sabine</B>: <font color='#000080'>Sabine meant to say something comforting, but to her own surprise, "I'm scared too, Rennie," was what she said.</font><br>
[Sat Jul 24 20:44:25 2004] : <font color='#008000'>** Rien just nods **</font><br>
[Sat Jul 24 20:45:21 2004] : <font color='#008000'>** Renate hugged the puppy closer, huddling into her sister's arm. **</font><br>
[Sat Jul 24 20:46:52 2004] : <B>Sabine</B>: <font color='#000080'>Sabine kissed her forehead. She looked up over Renate's bowed head to Rien, and beckoned him with the hand on Renate's shoulder.</font><br>
[Sat Jul 24 20:47:09 2004] : <font color='#008000'>** Rien comes closer **</font><br>
[Sat Jul 24 20:48:19 2004] : <font color='#008000'>** Rien puts his arms around Renate and holds her tightly **</font><br>
[Sat Jul 24 20:49:09 2004] : <font color='#008000'>** Renate trembled in their arms. **</font><br>
[Sat Jul 24 20:49:25 2004] : <B>Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>Dorothy, squeezed a little too tightly, yelped and squirmed free.</font><br>
[Sat Jul 24 20:50:26 2004] : <B>Rien</B>: <font color='#804040'>After some time, Rien says, "So then, what are we going to do about it?"</font><br>
[Sat Jul 24 20:51:58 2004] : <B>Sabine</B>: <font color='#000080'>Sabine released her hold and leaned back on her hands. "So far this all sounds like eyestrain and oversensitivity to light. Weakness, not actual damage."</font><br>
[Sat Jul 24 20:52:33 2004] : <B>Sabine</B>: <font color='#000080'>"We start taking care of you, and maybe it gets better. Rest. Sunglasses. Eyedrops. Somebody to do your heavy reading and writing for you. We'll start today, and maybe you won't even have to go see the Raphaelites about it by the time you go back to Ilium."</font><br>
[Sat Jul 24 20:53:00 2004] : <B>Rien</B>: <font color='#804040'>"Yes...that sounds a likely thing."</font><br>
[Sat Jul 24 20:53:13 2004] : <B>Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>"You really think so?"</font><br>
[Sat Jul 24 20:53:31 2004] : <B>Rien</B>: <font color='#804040'>"Has Sabine ever lead you wrong?"</font><br>
[Sat Jul 24 20:53:54 2004] : <B>Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>"No. Never once."</font><br>
[Sat Jul 24 20:54:35 2004] : <B>Sabine</B>: <font color='#000080'>"I'm curious, Ren -- let's try a test. How many fingers?" She held out her arms at odd angles in a sort of semaphore.</font><br>
