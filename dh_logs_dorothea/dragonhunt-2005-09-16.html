[Fri Sep 16 23:22:41 2005] : <B>(3) Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>well, we seem to be agreed on the color, at any rate</font><br>
[Fri Sep 16 23:23:02 2005] : <B>(2) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>Too much Dragonlance.</font><br>
[Fri Sep 16 23:23:18 2005] : <B>(5) Rien</B>: <font color='#004040'>aah... but the White Robes are a priestly order that was more sunk in monetary corruption than the Raphaelites</font><br>

[Fri Sep 16 23:23:29 2005] : <B>(5) Rien</B>: <font color='#004040'>for anyone who's ever read The Redemption of Althalus</font><br>
[Fri Sep 16 23:23:38 2005] : <B>(3) Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>I can't say that I have.</font><br>
[Fri Sep 16 23:23:49 2005] : <B>(3) Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>I read the first six or eight Dragonlance books when I was a kiddie at summer camp.</font><br>
[Fri Sep 16 23:23:59 2005] : <B>(3) Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>But I don't think I got that far.</font><br>
[Fri Sep 16 23:24:46 2005] : <B>(5) Rien</B>: <font color='#004040'>it's not a Dragonlance book</font><br>
[Fri Sep 16 23:24:55 2005] : <B>(3) Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>ah, explains why I haven't read it :)</font><br>
[Fri Sep 16 23:24:56 2005] : <B>(5) Rien</B>: <font color='#004040'>it's a book written by David and Leigh Eddings</font><br>
[Fri Sep 16 23:25:27 2005] : <B>(4) Aryk</B>: <font color='#000080'>Alan, sorry we sort of took that session away from you... We're stilll working on the vastly different views among the PC's, I think.  As difficult as it's been, I think we're coming along nicely.</font><br>
[Fri Sep 16 23:25:29 2005] : <B>(2) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>Anyway, see you soon, folks! And let's hope Aryk has it all figured out for a while.</font><br>
[Fri Sep 16 23:26:05 2005] : <B>(4) Aryk</B>: <font color='#000080'>In fact, I think that sort of character I've been striving for with Aryk isn't too far off at all.</font><br>
[Fri Sep 16 23:26:53 2005] : <B>(4) Aryk</B>: <font color='#000080'>But alright, we'll see you soon, then.  Hopefully, I can afford to make it to Mosaics sooner than later.</font><br>
[Fri Sep 16 23:26:56 2005] : <B>(3) Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>Well, Aryk can still raise holy hell with Renate in private. Things are just getting to the point where the public disagreement will almost certainly cause difficulties.</font><br>
