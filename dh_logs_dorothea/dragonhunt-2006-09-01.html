[Fri Sep  1 19:20:55 2006] : <B>(2) Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>I'm just really dubious about value for money and pain.</font><br>
[Fri Sep  1 19:21:16 2006] : <B>(1) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>Well, having insurance makes it easier. Plenty of people beat cancer if it's detected early.</font><br>

I thought it was a two-party system, where you can get either the Democrats or the Republicans into offi ce, dpeending upon whom youvote for.
