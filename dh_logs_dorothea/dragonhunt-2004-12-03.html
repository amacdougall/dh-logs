[Fri Dec 03 21:27:19 2004] : <B>Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>Thus, Wrenfall, even if taught without fancy kikou (spirit control) or meditation techniques, will eventually become ki-based.</font><br>
[Fri Dec 03 21:27:35 2004] : <B>Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>Most styles "force the issue" by studying kikou in the first place.</font><br>
[Fri Dec 03 21:27:55 2004] : <B>Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>This means that sure, the student can create fancy blue-green shockwaves or freeze people in ice or whatever...</font><br>
[Fri Dec 03 21:28:19 2004] : <B>Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>...but that doesn't make them superior. I'm sure you've looked at the numbers and realized that Wrenfall's more utilitarian techniques are as good as the fancier styles.</font><br>
[Fri Dec 03 21:28:30 2004] : <B>Dorothea</B>: <font color='#000080'>But at the risk, I should think, of either burning them out or stunting their later development.</font><br>
[Fri Dec 03 21:28:31 2004] : <B>Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>(This discussion isn't really about crunch, though.)</font><br>
[Fri Dec 03 21:28:58 2004] : <B>Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>Anyway, Renate has gotten to the point where Aaron can begin to teach her the second level of Wrenfall -- explicitly empowered moves.</font><br>
[Fri Dec 03 21:29:00 2004] : <B>Dorothea</B>: <font color='#000080'>(Shrug. She's used to getting her ass kicked. She assumes it's her and not the style.)</font><br>
[Fri Dec 03 21:29:22 2004] : <B>Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>This first one, simply called "Rainbow," is sort of a litmus test and signature for the second level.</font><br>
[Fri Dec 03 21:30:00 2004] : <B>Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>Each student of Wrenfall develops his own version. Coris's "Rainbow Collider," Aaron's "Rainbow Circle," and so forth.</font><br>
[Fri Dec 03 21:30:12 2004] : <B>Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>Each does something somewhat different.</font><br>
[Fri Dec 03 21:30:26 2004] : <B>Dorothea</B>: <font color='#000080'>well, if we're going to do this we might as well play it out :)</font><br>
[Fri Dec 03 21:30:35 2004] : <B>Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>You'll be free to think up what yours does, during the time when Renate is supposed to be practicing the move.</font><br>
[Fri Dec 03 21:30:40 2004] : <B>Dorothea</B>: <font color='#000080'>Okay.</font><br>
[Fri Dec 03 21:30:41 2004] : <B>Rien</B>: <font color='#004040'>how many people, thus far, have been taught Wrenfall by Aaron?  3?</font><br>
[Fri Dec 03 21:30:41 2004] : <B>Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>Of course, that's what we'll do when we get the chance.</font><br>
[Fri Dec 03 21:31:07 2004] : <B>Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>Right now I have a board game to play with Dave and Kim. "Carcassonne," a puzzly little tile-laying game about constructing a French medieval countryside.</font><br>
[Fri Dec 03 21:31:13 2004] : <B>Dorothea</B>: <font color='#000080'>oh, that's a fun one!</font><br>
[Fri Dec 03 21:31:27 2004] : <B>Rien</B>: <font color='#004040'>never heard of it</font><br>
[Fri Dec 03 21:31:31 2004] : <B>Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>I've seen it played so far, but haven't played it.</font><br>
[Fri Dec 03 21:31:36 2004] : <B>Rien</B>: <font color='#004040'>I have a Jedi Academy training session ot go thorugh personally</font><br>
[Fri Dec 03 21:31:37 2004] : <B>Dorothea</B>: <font color='#000080'>extremely well-designed</font><br>
[Fri Dec 03 21:31:38 2004] : <B>Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>So I'm curious to try it out.</font><br>
[Fri Dec 03 21:31:40 2004] : <B>Rien</B>: <font color='#004040'>and a resume to work on</font><br>
[Fri Dec 03 21:31:50 2004] : <B>Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>Hey, Jedi Academy is also extremely well-designed.</font><br>
[Fri Dec 03 21:31:58 2004] : <B>Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>Love that game, the interaction of powers.</font><br>
[Fri Dec 03 21:32:03 2004] : <B>Rien</B>: <font color='#004040'>yep</font><br>
[Fri Dec 03 21:32:12 2004] : <B>Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>If combat in the movies were as good as combat in the game, for instance...</font><br>
[Fri Dec 03 21:32:21 2004] : <B>Dorothea</B>: <font color='#000080'>well, have fun, then, you two</font><br>
[Fri Dec 03 21:32:24 2004] : <B>Rien</B>: <font color='#004040'>talking about such I *am* going ot be keeping my eyes open for a PC release of Jade Empire</font><br>
[Fri Dec 03 21:32:24 2004] : <B>Dorothea</B>: <font color='#000080'>and I hope Tifan wasn't too pushy</font><br>
[Fri Dec 03 21:32:34 2004] : <B>Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>I think I've said it before. In the movies it's all "sabers, force, sabers, force." They never use everything all at once like they should.</font><br>
[Fri Dec 03 21:32:45 2004] : <B>Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>Perhaps in the next one, which is kind of looking like a big series of duels.</font><br>
[Fri Dec 03 21:33:07 2004] : <B>Rien</B>: <font color='#004040'>personally I love the dueals sabers ultra-move</font><br>
[Fri Dec 03 21:33:17 2004] : <B>Rien</B>: <font color='#004040'>whirling arc of lighty death</font><br>
[Fri Dec 03 21:33:24 2004] : <B>Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>What, the advancing spinning thing?</font><br>
[Fri Dec 03 21:33:30 2004] : <font color='#008000'>** Rien shoots his typist **</font><br>
[Fri Dec 03 21:33:41 2004] : <B>Rien</B>: <font color='#004040'>no, that's the double saber's</font><br>
[Fri Dec 03 21:33:56 2004] : <B>Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>Oh, right, right, when you throw them out using the force and they spin around.</font><br>
[Fri Dec 03 21:33:58 2004] : <B>Rien</B>: <font color='#004040'>the dual saber's one is where they crouch and it all goes spinning aorund them</font><br>
[Fri Dec 03 21:34:28 2004] : <B>Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>You know, the coolest thing I ever did was use the twin-saber move where you stab out to both sides simultaneously to kill two dark Jedi at once.</font><br>
[Fri Dec 03 21:34:38 2004] : <B>Rien</B>: <font color='#004040'>yep</font><br>
[Fri Dec 03 21:34:38 2004] : <B>Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>It was accidental, but awesome.</font><br>
[Fri Dec 03 21:34:42 2004] : <font color='#ff0000'>Disconnecting from server...</font><br>
[Fri Dec 03 21:34:43 2004] : <font color='#ff0000'>Game disconnected!</font><br>
