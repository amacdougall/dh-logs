[Fri May 26 19:15:13 2006] : <B>(1) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>New fluff in your mailboxes.</font><br>
[Fri May 26 19:15:16 2006] : <B>(3) Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>Saw it.</font><br>
[Fri May 26 19:15:17 2006] : <B>(1) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>Complete with OMG.</font><br>
[Fri May 26 19:15:24 2006] : <B>(3) Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>Poor Renate. She really is a lightning rod.</font><br>
[Fri May 26 19:15:38 2006] : <B>(1) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>Well, it at least explains a little of why they left her out for so long.</font><br>
[Fri May 26 19:15:58 2006] : <B>(3) Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>Yeah, doesn't explain why nobody looked her in the eye and said "honey, it's not <em>you</em> we don't trust."</font><br>
[Fri May 26 19:16:18 2006] : <B>(2) Aryk</B>: <font color='#000080'>I don't get a three day weekend.  Sniff.</font><br>
[Fri May 26 19:16:24 2006] : <B>(1) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>Because they figured if she's <i>completely</i> ignorant it's safest.</font><br>
[Fri May 26 19:16:31 2006] : <B>(1) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>Note how paranoid Aaron is right now.</font><br>
[Fri May 26 19:16:36 2006] : <B>(3) Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>Yep.</font><br>
[Fri May 26 19:16:41 2006] : <B>(1) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>He's been maintaining that discipline since Renate was born.</font><br>
[Fri May 26 19:16:47 2006] : <B>(3) Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>But there are risks to that also.</font><br>
[Fri May 26 19:17:02 2006] : <B>(3) Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>Not least the risk that Renate finally says "fuck this noise" and strikes out on her own.</font><br>
[Fri May 26 19:17:16 2006] : <B>(3) Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>But then, that might not be such a bad thing from their POV.</font><br>
[Fri May 26 19:17:17 2006] : <B>(1) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>Actually, you may have noticed they're basically expecting that.</font><br>
[Fri May 26 19:18:05 2006] : <B>(3) Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>Well, then possibilities are two -- they expect her to hop right back when they call, or they don't actually need her that badly and are ready to write her off.</font><br>
[Fri May 26 19:18:33 2006] : <B>(1) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>Third possibility: they'll just throw their weight behind her one they can tell what she's doing.</font><br>
[Fri May 26 19:18:40 2006] : <B>(1) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>once</font><br>
[Fri May 26 19:18:42 2006] : <B>(3) Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>heh</font><br>
[Fri May 26 19:18:44 2006] : <B>(3) Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>we'll see</font><br>
[Fri May 26 19:19:04 2006] : <B>(3) Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'><em>that</em> opens the question of whether she'd want them to</font><br>
[Fri May 26 19:19:05 2006] : <B>(4) Rien</B>: <font color='#004000'>And if they do need her, and push her to the point of striking out on her own, then they're -- in a way -- going to have to manipulate her into doing what they need her to do.</font><br>
[Fri May 26 19:19:15 2006] : <B>(3) Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>They're already manipulating her.</font><br>
[Fri May 26 19:19:33 2006] : <B>(3) Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>It's a dangerous thing to do.</font><br>
[Fri May 26 19:19:49 2006] : <B>(3) Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>She tends to royally screw over beings who do that to her.</font><br>
[Fri May 26 19:20:03 2006] : <B>(3) Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>If I were Aaron, I'd be worried sick.</font><br>
[Fri May 26 19:20:36 2006] : <B>(3) Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>Eh, well. Off we go, then.</font><br>
[Fri May 26 19:20:36 2006] : <B>(4) Rien</B>: <font color='#004000'>I wonder if, in some respects, he doesn't know her half as well as he thinks he does.</font><br>
[Fri May 26 19:20:50 2006] : <B>(3) Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>Renate's fairly transparent.</font><br>
[Fri May 26 19:21:08 2006] : <B>(3) Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>But that's a double-edged sword; she expects it from others.</font><br>
[Fri May 26 19:21:15 2006] : <B>(1) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>Aaron's expecting she won't be too sad to realize she has an army behind her.</font><br>
[Fri May 26 19:21:29 2006] : <B>(1) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>Of people she thought were a closed book.</font><br>
[Fri May 26 19:21:54 2006] : <B>(3) Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>Still dangerous. She could take one look and say "it's not <em>my</em> army."</font><br>
[Fri May 26 19:22:22 2006] : <B>(1) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>Well, we'll burn that bridge when we get to it. In fact, a lot will be decided by the end of this chapter.</font><br>
[Fri May 26 19:22:42 2006] : <B>(1) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>I've just been dithering for a week over exactly how to do it all.</font><br>
[Fri May 26 19:22:58 2006] : <B>(1) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>So as it stands, I'll be kind of improvising.</font><br>
[Fri May 26 19:23:21 2006] : <B>(1) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>Where's Renate headed after the Karlbotel visit?</font><br>
[Fri May 26 19:23:33 2006] : <B>(1) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>Events will just intercept at some suitable waypoint.</font><br>
[Fri May 26 19:23:46 2006] : <B>(3) Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>Ilium briefly, and then out into the Patchworks to Sune, I should think.</font><br>
[Fri May 26 19:23:56 2006] : <B>(4) Rien</B>: <font color='#004000'>Yep</font><br>
[Fri May 26 19:24:14 2006] : <B>(3) Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>Two goals in the Patchworks: find Adam Mayonet for Aryk, and scope out a few of the local city-states.</font><br>
[Fri May 26 19:24:15 2006] : <B>(4) Rien</B>: <font color='#004000'>With a stopover between Ilium and leaving to do some plane-walking with Rien.</font><br>
[Fri May 26 19:24:24 2006] : <B>(1) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>Ah, fine then. Renate's old apartment has been continuously "occupied," as far as the post office is concerned, so it's a perfectly reasonable place to send a letter.</font><br>
[Fri May 26 19:24:34 2006] : <B>(3) Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>Ah, yes, we want to alert Lionel and Kander about the missing Wrenfall scion.</font><br>
[Fri May 26 19:24:57 2006] : <B>(3) Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>And Renate urges Coris in the strongest terms to tell Poya that the book endangers her son.</font><br>
[Fri May 26 19:25:05 2006] : <B>(4) Rien</B>: <font color='#004000'>And Rien wants to sneak Renate in to talk to Lyria in person, too.</font><br>
[Fri May 26 19:25:23 2006] : <B>(1) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>Coris takes this immediately to heart and promises to go find her directly.</font><br>
[Fri May 26 19:25:34 2006] : <B>(3) Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>In Ilium -- get Specs to maybe file some requests for information in Gereval, see if we can pick up the adoption's legal trail.</font><br>
[Fri May 26 19:25:52 2006] : <B>(1) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>(For reference, he is interpreting Aaron's directive to "stick with Renate" as "keep tabs on Renate and play cavalry as needed")</font><br>
[Fri May 26 19:26:02 2006] : <B>(1) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>(This is mostly a GM choice, so I don't have to keep track of his entire gang of NPCs at all times)</font><br>
[Fri May 26 19:26:04 2006] : <B>(3) Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>heh -- she disappears fast, though</font><br>
[Fri May 26 19:26:14 2006] : <B>(3) Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>he's going to have a frustrating time of it</font><br>
[Fri May 26 19:26:20 2006] : <B>(1) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>I'll just improve his track-keeping abilities by putting Masan Ahim on that job.</font><br>
[Fri May 26 19:26:43 2006] : <B>(4) Rien</B>: <font color='#004000'>So Masan's already disposed of the sword by this point, then?</font><br>
[Fri May 26 19:26:56 2006] : <B>(1) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>Yes; he just had to hand it off to a contact.</font><br>
[Fri May 26 19:26:56 2006] : <B>(3) Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>Renate would have written Poya herself, except that Poya would naturally assume that Renate is just trying to get hold of the book.</font><br>
[Fri May 26 19:27:59 2006] : <B>(3) Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>Oh, and let's send a rubbing of that tombstone anonymously to Heaven HQ.</font><br>
[Fri May 26 19:28:11 2006] : <B>(3) Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>Let <em>them</em> deal with LoCaine showing up in Sunset Park.</font><br>
[Fri May 26 19:28:48 2006] : <B>(1) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>By the way, Aaron does take the opportunity to teach Renate a couple of new techniques: Vigilante Justice, Tiger-Killing Stance, and Critical Wire Attack.</font><br>
[Fri May 26 19:29:11 2006] : <B>(2) Aryk</B>: <font color='#000080'>Craziness.</font><br>
[Fri May 26 19:29:54 2006] : <B>(1) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>And he pushes her to develop a few things he was never agile enough to pull off, helping her discover a way of hitting an enemy, then immediately running up him and jumping off in a new direction.</font><br>
[Fri May 26 19:29:55 2006] : <B>(2) Aryk</B>: <font color='#000080'>(I just read the fluff.)</font><br>
[Fri May 26 19:30:02 2006] : <B>(1) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>It's up to her how to name and use it.</font><br>
[Fri May 26 19:30:29 2006] : <B>(1) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>Er, and the "Vigilante Justice" thing is actually an extension of that -- when people are close enough, she can just jump from person to person, hitting each one once.</font><br>
[Fri May 26 19:30:35 2006] : <B>(2) Aryk</B>: <font color='#000080'>Call it "Devil May Cry."</font><br>

[Fri May 26 19:30:56 2006] : <B>(1) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>Heh.</font><br>
[Fri May 26 19:31:12 2006] : <B>(1) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>It would be "All Living Humans Must Perish," but that's already in Greylight's style.</font><br>
[Fri May 26 19:31:23 2006] : <B>(3) Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>And that's not Renate's style at all.</font><br>
[Fri May 26 19:31:29 2006] : <B>(1) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>Anyway, Renate will learn the fifth and final level of the style when and if she combines the two books.</font><br>
[Fri May 26 19:32:16 2006] : <B>(1) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>And do feel free to develop and add moves to your arsenals, if you'd like. Not that we do a ton of fighting in the game.</font><br>
[Fri May 26 19:32:42 2006] : <B>(1) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>But if coming up with fancy martial arts attacks is your thing, I wouldn't stop you!</font><br>
[Fri May 26 19:32:48 2006] : <B>(3) Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>Eh. I don't really have the video-game background to do that right.</font><br>
[Fri May 26 19:33:25 2006] : <B>(4) Rien</B>: <font color='#004000'>Well, I'd like Rien to develop that time-delayed damage attack.</font><br>
[Fri May 26 19:33:27 2006] : <B>(1) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>Right. I admit it's all based on a particularly genre-riffic view of traditional martial arts.</font><br>
[Fri May 26 19:33:41 2006] : <B>(4) Rien</B>: <font color='#004000'>That was really developed for the turn-based fighting though.</font><br>
[Fri May 26 19:33:54 2006] : <B>(1) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>Ah, yeah. Well, since we've done away with turns, it's actually easier to do.</font><br>
[Fri May 26 19:33:57 2006] : <B>(4) Rien</B>: <font color='#004000'>Three strikes over three rounds, with all the dmaage arrivingin the fourth.</font><br>
[Fri May 26 19:34:32 2006] : <B>(2) Aryk</B>: <font color='#000080'>I wanna make new moves too!!</font><br>
[Fri May 26 19:34:37 2006] : <B>(1) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>Too bad.</font><br>

[Fri May 26 22:18:24 2006] : <B>(1) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>"My lady," she says, dropping a proper curtsey only somewhat ruined by her lack of a skirt. (Orange denim breeches and a russet leather jacket, instead.)</font><br>

[Fri May 26 22:24:06 2006] : <B>(3) Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>Rather unwillingly, she is favorably impressed. The full-on Clara/Godfrey treatment is difficult to endure with aplomb -- or, at least, Renate always found it so.</font><br>

[Fri May 26 22:24:41 2006] : <B>(1) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>"But I have been asked to tell you that she is motivated by 'the utmost contrition.'"</font><br>

[Fri May 26 22:30:35 2006] : <B>(3) Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>"Very well. Pray convey to Mistress Dupre that no contrition is necessary. As for Keph LoCaine, surely his crimes suffice to condemn him without any word from me; likewise, I should assuredly not prevent his destruction from some misguided notion of personal vengeance.

[Fri May 26 22:31:21 2006] : <B>(3) Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>"I accept no gifts from your employer. I request no services. Thus, I remain unbeholden. Please so inform him."</font><br>
