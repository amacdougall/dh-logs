[Fri Oct 28 21:27:33 2005] : <B>(3) Sashi</B>: <font color='#004040'>and if he goes off at her she'll smack him one then give him as long a speech as you can in sign-language</font><br>
[Fri Oct 28 21:27:43 2005] : <B>(3) Sashi</B>: <font color='#004040'>well, okay, maybe not that long</font><br>

[Fri Oct 28 21:29:06 2005] : <B>(2) Tancred</B>: <font color='#000080'>serve him bloody well right</font><br>
