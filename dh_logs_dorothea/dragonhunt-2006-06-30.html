[Fri Jun 30 19:40:31 2006] : <B>(4) Aryk</B>: <font color='#000080'>Yeah, I kind of agree with Dorothea.  We get our Illium stuff done, and then we set off on the next journey.</font><br>

[Fri Jun 30 19:41:16 2006] : <B>(2) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>Arretia's doing fine; she's been having a bit of a hard time finding industry contacts who don't want to set her up as a teen idol or something sleazier.</font><br>
[Fri Jun 30 19:41:19 2006] : <B>(3) Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>Which is why Renate wants to at least cut through there.</font><br>

[Fri Jun 30 19:41:51 2006] : <B>(2) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>Weregild was a bit of help, but he also advised her to get an education and classical instrument/composition training before trying to make the scene.</font><br>

[Fri Jun 30 19:42:58 2006] : <B>(4) Aryk</B>: <font color='#000080'>Ah, okay.  Aryk can help her in that department, too.  While in Illium, he can at least accompany her to some meetings with industry folks to get them both a connection.</font><br>

[Fri Jun 30 19:44:43 2006] : <B>(3) Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>Near there, yeah.</font><br>
[Fri Jun 30 19:45:13 2006] : <B>(2) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>There are so many dashed-off answers and thoughts that I have a hard time keeping them all organized. Unless I made some sort of database app entirely for Dragonhunt information...</font><br>

[Fri Jun 30 19:50:24 2006] : <B>(2) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>Well, okay... the fast-talkers in and around Southtown and Monterey Heights are able to get Aryk gigs all along the Silver Coast, after a few telegraphic exchanges.</font><br>
[Fri Jun 30 19:50:43 2006] : <B>(2) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>They're mostly small-time stuff&#8212;opening up for local bands.</font><br>

[Fri Jun 30 19:52:53 2006] : <B>(2) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>As one of the headline acts of a midwinter festival.</font><br>
[Fri Jun 30 19:53:21 2006] : <B>(4) Aryk</B>: <font color='#000080'>Aryk will take whatever he can get.  You've got to start somewhere, and as far as being a known rapper goes, he's done next to nothing as far as organized events go.</font><br>
[Fri Jun 30 19:53:34 2006] : <B>(4) Aryk</B>: <font color='#000080'>But he'll definitely jump on the Ithaca event.</font><br>
[Fri Jun 30 19:53:50 2006] : <B>(2) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>Gem mining slows down in Ithaca over the winter, since it turns into blizzards and glassy ice... so the mining companies bring in a lot of expensive entertainment, food, and alcohol to keep people from just going home.</font><br>
[Fri Jun 30 19:54:55 2006] : <B>(2) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>They're paying a pretty hefty ten gold to anyone who'll come up and entertain, as long as that person has a good enough rep or recommendation.</font><br>
[Fri Jun 30 19:55:34 2006] : <B>(4) Aryk</B>: <font color='#000080'>He'll take it.  10 gold sounds pretty fantastic to him at this point.  Also, on a whim, before they go off traveling, Aryk gets a makeover.  Namely, he gets a major haircut.</font><br>
[Fri Jun 30 19:55:38 2006] : <B>(2) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>By the time you've made it up to Ys, while Renate is visiting the temple, Aryk gets word back that his and Arretia's demo was accepted by the Ithaca mining association board.</font><br>
[Fri Jun 30 19:55:49 2006] : <B>(4) Aryk</B>: <font color='#000080'>Cool.</font><br>
[Fri Jun 30 19:56:31 2006] : <B>(2) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>There's also word, informally, that Ithaca's on the brink of a miner's strike... just as the mining companies banded together to fix prices and worker treatment, all the workers unionized in response.</font><br>

[Fri Jun 30 19:56:54 2006] : <B>(3) Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>Renate warns Aryk to take some extra elixirs.</font><br>
[Fri Jun 30 19:57:33 2006] : <B>(4) Aryk</B>: <font color='#000080'>Aryk informs Renate he hasn't even bought an elixir in months, but "what could possibly go wrong?"</font><br>
[Fri Jun 30 19:57:34 2006] : <B>(2) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>And, according to a newspaper article Renate happens to see, the unions brought in a "special consultant" to oversee "pacifism assurance" activities.</font><br>

[Fri Jun 30 19:58:19 2006] : <B>(2) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>Which <i>just might</i> mean assassinating strikebreakers... or roughing up scabs... or who knows what. The articles, even in the underground progressive zines, are vague.</font><br>
[Fri Jun 30 19:58:26 2006] : <B>(3) Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>Yep. That's what I'm afraid of.</font><br>

[Fri Jun 30 19:59:16 2006] : <B>(3) Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>Might be Kuhn. Might be Emily on a quirky streak.</font><br>
[Fri Jun 30 19:59:19 2006] : <B>(2) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>I think I mentioned at her first appearance that she was in a miner's guild. If not, well, she is.</font><br>
[Fri Jun 30 19:59:39 2006] : <B>(3) Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>Right, we're going.</font><br>
[Fri Jun 30 20:00:07 2006] : <B>(4) Aryk</B>: <font color='#000080'>I was thinking Kuhn right off the bat, too.</font><br>
[Fri Jun 30 20:00:09 2006] : <B>(1) Rien</B>: <font color='#004000'>Rien, since he's been paid, tops up everyone's gauntlets.</font><br>
[Fri Jun 30 20:00:24 2006] : <B>(4) Aryk</B>: <font color='#000080'>Aryk accepts Rien's elixis with thanks.</font><br>

[Fri Jun 30 20:01:14 2006] : <B>(2) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>All right, lemme fire up the log. You want to start in Ys or on the entrance to Ithaca?</font><br>
[Fri Jun 30 20:01:27 2006] : <B>(3) Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>Either way. If there's anything interesting in Ys, go for it.</font><br>
[Fri Jun 30 20:03:11 2006] : <B>(2) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>Well, there is plenty interesting, I just can't imagine I want to deal with much of it right now.</font><br>
[Fri Jun 30 20:03:21 2006] : <B>(3) Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>You're GM.</font><br>
[Fri Jun 30 20:03:51 2006] : <B>(2) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>Okay, sorry about all the indecision.</font><br>
