[Wed Dec 29 11:20:29 2004] : <B>Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>Okay, when and where, do you think?</font><br>
[Wed Dec 29 11:21:15 2004] : <B>Aryk</B>: <font color='#000080'>That's a good question.  I think they'd likely meet on the tour.  I figure, even if Aryk doesn't get the spot, maybe he'd go and see the show anyway.</font><br>
[Wed Dec 29 11:21:53 2004] : <B>Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>hm... I was hoping they'd manage to hook back up in Ilium. There should be some time between the contest and the tour start.</font><br>
[Wed Dec 29 11:22:48 2004] : <B>Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>Is Aryk still living in his and Rien's apartment? Or has he gone back to the temple?</font><br>
[Wed Dec 29 11:23:30 2004] : <B>Aryk</B>: <font color='#000080'>(Sorry, food was done)  Oh, you think so?  Okay, then, Illium it is.</font><br>
[Wed Dec 29 11:24:00 2004] : <B>Aryk</B>: <font color='#000080'>Aryk probably isn't back at the apartment yet.  Then again, he's probably not at the temple either.  In fact, he's probably bumming it.  </font><br>
[Wed Dec 29 11:24:15 2004] : <B>Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>As far as the Purgatory gig goes, it should be safe for you to say "If all goes well, I'll be opening for Purgatory!" That way we can still talk about it without committing to Aryk opening. :)</font><br>
[Wed Dec 29 11:24:39 2004] : <B>Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>really? poor thing!</font><br>
[Wed Dec 29 11:24:51 2004] : <B>Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>I tell you what... they can meet at Carragio's. That makes sense.</font><br>
[Wed Dec 29 11:24:54 2004] : <B>Aryk</B>: <font color='#000080'>There's an old oak tree I've worked into two of my fluff pieces in Angelwatch.  He's probably been sleeping under that.</font><br>
[Wed Dec 29 11:25:05 2004] : <B>Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>ha! if he doesn't watch out Talos's guys will pick him up!</font><br>
[Wed Dec 29 11:25:16 2004] : <B>Aryk</B>: <font color='#000080'>Heh, yep.  He might go and clean himself up at the temple, but that'd be about it.</font><br>
[Wed Dec 29 11:25:24 2004] : <B>Aryk</B>: <font color='#000080'>He'd talk his way out of it.  </font><br>
[Wed Dec 29 11:25:37 2004] : <B>Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>And Carragio knows some of what happened to Rien, so it's all good.</font><br>
[Wed Dec 29 11:26:03 2004] : <B>Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>right-ho, then</font><br>
[Wed Dec 29 11:26:07 2004] : <font color='#0000ff'>Log filename is "dragonhunt-29-12-04.html", system is is logging.</font><br>

[Wed Dec 29 11:26:51 2004] : <B>Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>It's hot. Sticky-hot. Really, really hot. It's also lunchtime, in spite of the heat.</font><br>
[Wed Dec 29 11:27:10 2004] : <B>Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>The air is so thick one could almost put a straw in it and drink it.</font><br>
[Wed Dec 29 11:27:35 2004] : <B>Aryk</B>: <font color='#000080'>(Hmm.. sounds like Florida)</font><br>
[Wed Dec 29 11:27:51 2004] : <B>Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>Ilium is dragging a bit, it's so hot; the wet air muffles the weldon boxes, and the streets are quiet.</font><br>
[Wed Dec 29 11:28:23 2004] : <B>Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>Still, neither rain nor sleet nor wringing heat keeps the winner of the Saffold-Marman Invitational from his daily lunch crowd.</font><br>
[Wed Dec 29 11:29:15 2004] : <B>Aryk</B>: <font color='#000080'>After another night under the oak tree, Aryk snuck himself into the temple to clean up, and now he heads over to Carragio's for breakfast.</font><br>
[Wed Dec 29 11:31:43 2004] : <i><B>Aryk</B> (whispering): <font color='#000080'>Would you like them to meet there?  Or perhaps elsewhere where maybe Aryk has gone off to eat his food?</font></i><br>
[Wed Dec 29 11:31:54 2004] : <B>Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>He walks into the white-hot expanse of Berthold Square, mirage-ripples rising from the pavement. Someone is talking to Carragio, back turned toward Aryk; he has to look twice, but -- yes, it is! Short, blonde, a long curved sword on her back -- it <em>is</em> Renate!</font><br>
[Wed Dec 29 11:32:01 2004] : <font color='#0000ff'><i>whispering to Aryk,  got it covered :)</i> </font><br>
[Wed Dec 29 11:33:06 2004] : <B>Aryk</B>: <font color='#000080'>It takes all of his willpower to keep from barrelling into her.  She can hear his footsteps from several yards away as races toward her.</font><br>
[Wed Dec 29 11:34:04 2004] : <B>Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>She turns quickly, dropping into a fighting stance -- and then <em>she</em> barrels into <em>him</em>, all but knocking him over.</font><br>
[Wed Dec 29 11:34:21 2004] : <B>Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>"Aryk! Oh, saints and angels, it's so good to see you!"</font><br>
[Wed Dec 29 11:34:32 2004] : <B>Aryk</B>: <font color='#000080'>Aryk throws his arms around her and hoists her up and twirls her, all in one blindingly fast motion.  "It is you!  It is you!"</font><br>
[Wed Dec 29 11:35:03 2004] : <B>Aryk</B>: <font color='#000080'>He squeezes tightly.  "Never... ever ever ever do that again!"  He plants a big kiss on her cheek.</font><br>
[Wed Dec 29 11:36:36 2004] : <B>Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>She kisses his cheek right back. "I'm sorry, I'm sorry -- I was <em>such</em> a mess, and I never thought you'd forgive me, and... oh, I missed you!"</font><br>
[Wed Dec 29 11:37:33 2004] : <B>Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>"Definitely a case of Reunion Ragout!" Carragio proclaims. "The world is my heatstone today, and good things are cooking."</font><br>
[Wed Dec 29 11:37:46 2004] : <B>Aryk</B>: <font color='#000080'>"I missed you too, Rennie."  After a long hug he sets her down. </font><br>
[Wed Dec 29 11:38:10 2004] : <font color='#008000'>** Aryk flashes a smile at Carragio **</font><br>
[Wed Dec 29 11:38:26 2004] : <B>Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>Laughter bubbles out of her, lighter than the heavy air. "Well, we've given Berthold Square a show, haven't we?"</font><br>
[Wed Dec 29 11:38:51 2004] : <B>Aryk</B>: <font color='#000080'>"Huh?  Oh... yeah, I guess we have.  Oh well."</font><br>
[Wed Dec 29 11:39:25 2004] : <B>Aryk</B>: <font color='#000080'>"So... are you here to stay?  Don't tell me you actually think I'm going to let you run off again."</font><br>
[Wed Dec 29 11:39:26 2004] : <B>Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>She takes his arm, properly this time. "It doesn't matter. Why <em>shouldn't</em> I be glad to see you, after all?"</font><br>
[Wed Dec 29 11:39:39 2004] : <B>Aryk</B>: <font color='#000080'>"Exactly."</font><br>
[Wed Dec 29 11:40:08 2004] : <B>Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>"Well, um... we'll talk about that. I've got a job. You can probably come with, though; always room for one more on this kind of thing."</font><br>
[Wed Dec 29 11:40:22 2004] : <B>Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>"But I'm not running away from you again, if that's what you're asking."</font><br>
[Wed Dec 29 11:41:31 2004] : <B>Aryk</B>: <font color='#000080'>"Okay.  Well, I guess you could say I'm still more or less unemployed... and I'd love to come with... but... if all goes well, I was going to hook up with the Purgatory tour, actually.  And uh... I was going to ask you to come with me!"</font><br>
[Wed Dec 29 11:42:16 2004] : <B>Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>She stares at him, jaw dropping. Then she laughs again, until she has to take off her sunglasses to wipe her eyes.</font><br>
[Wed Dec 29 11:42:30 2004] : <B>Aryk</B>: <font color='#000080'>"What?  What's so funny?"</font><br>
[Wed Dec 29 11:43:07 2004] : <B>Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>"Well, I'd say that was a good sign, Sir Aryk," Carragio says, handing over two boxes of savory-smelling stew. "You take her down to the park and eat these."</font><br>
[Wed Dec 29 11:43:50 2004] : <B>Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>"Just... the world... it's so funny sometimes," Renate gasps, replacing her sunglasses. "I'll explain when we get there. Thanks, Carragio."</font><br>
[Wed Dec 29 11:44:36 2004] : <B>Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>They walk sedately toward Bevier Park, keeping to the shady side of the street. "But a funny world is better than a terrible one," Renate opines.</font><br>
[Wed Dec 29 11:45:34 2004] : <B>Aryk</B>: <font color='#000080'>"Yeah, that's true."  Aryk samples his food while they walk.</font><br>
[Wed Dec 29 11:46:12 2004] : <B>Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>Renate just chuckles. When they find themselves a park bench in the shade of a willow, she says, "All right, Aryk, here's what's funny. My job? Is security for the Purgatory tour. I'm with Coris's team."</font><br>
[Wed Dec 29 11:46:44 2004] : <B>Aryk</B>: <font color='#000080'>"Wha... no way?  Really?  That's awesome!"</font><br>
[Wed Dec 29 11:47:18 2004] : <B>Aryk</B>: <font color='#000080'>"How'd you land that gig?"</font><br>
[Wed Dec 29 11:48:04 2004] : <B>Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>"Coris landed it, actually, and I invited myself along before he could think better of it. What are you doing with them?"</font><br>
[Wed Dec 29 11:49:21 2004] : <B>Aryk</B>: <font color='#000080'>"Well... I'm trying to work a deal right now... to be the opening act, actually."  Aryk smiles.  Renate can tell he's anxious.</font><br>
[Wed Dec 29 11:49:54 2004] : <B>Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>"No... kidding?" Her eyes widen, then narrow. "Hm. This have anything to do with Dorothy?"</font><br>
[Wed Dec 29 11:50:45 2004] : <B>Aryk</B>: <font color='#000080'>"Heh... not anymore, it doesn't."</font><br>
[Wed Dec 29 11:51:09 2004] : <B>Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>"How about you tell me the whole story here, hm?"</font><br>

[Wed Dec 29 11:53:54 2004] : <B>Aryk</B>: <font color='#000080'>"Yeah, she's great.  She was concerned with Dorothy Durai opening up for Purgatory... you know, with her track record and all.  She the two of us, well, it was her idea, but we struck a deal with Hermit that if we 'convinced' Durai not to join the tour, I could fill in for the opening act."</font><br>

[Wed Dec 29 12:39:18 2004] : <B>Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>"Yes, that's what I said, more or less. Except I didn't quite say that I didn't think he was evil. I said that I didn't know.

[Wed Dec 29 12:39:34 2004] : <B>Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>"Rien wasn't evil. But I don't know about that other part."</font><br>

[Wed Dec 29 12:41:37 2004] : <B>Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>"That's what Carragio says. Apparently Rien did some pretty serious wigging himself. I sent Leonid after him; took him <i>days</i> to chase Rien down."</font><br>

[Wed Dec 29 12:51:41 2004] : <B>Aryk</B>: <font color='#000080'>"Well... yes and no.  I was sort of encapsulated in stone from the knees down at the time.  I could hear it.  I could hear Dark Eternal's voice.  I could hear Heartbreaker's agony.  But Rennie, that's just it!  It was Dark Eternal's voice!  Not Rien's!  He's a victim in this!  He's more scared then both of us together!"</font><br>
