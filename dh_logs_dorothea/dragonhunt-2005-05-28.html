[Sat May 28 18:22:53 2005] : <B>Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>The fall lasts for a very long time; so long that instead of having any sensation of falling, you're buoyed in a timeless freefall, the faintest breeze belying terminal velocity.</font><br>
[Sat May 28 18:23:44 2005] : <B>Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>The surface of the sea stretches out in all directions, and is so calm that there aren't even whitecaps or troughs to give a sense of scale, to give you some idea of how close you are to hitting.</font><br>

[Sat May 28 18:24:56 2005] : <B>Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>After a time, you realize that you aren't breathing; and that you are in fact underwater, rising up toward the surface through water as clear as glass.</font><br>
[Sat May 28 18:25:43 2005] : <B>Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>Your heads break the surface at the same time, as you finally reach the mutable boundary between a sea and sky so gray and empty they are indistinguishable.</font><br>

[Sat May 28 18:27:22 2005] : <B>Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>There is no sun, no clouds, no stars, no moon.</font><br>
[Sat May 28 18:27:43 2005] : <B>Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>No waves, barely even ripples, just enough rise and fall of the sea to lull the senses.</font><br>
[Sat May 28 18:28:01 2005] : <B>Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>The sea has no bottom, says lore; and though it has life, it has no past and no future.</font><br>
[Sat May 28 18:28:45 2005] : <B>Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>In the sea's lower reaches, far deeper than any earth sea could possibly be, the pressure makes the water like rock, and only elementals can live.</font><br>

[Sat May 28 18:33:17 2005] : <B>Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>"Waterproof canvas, steel bows, wood, brass."</font><br>
[Sat May 28 18:33:54 2005] : <font color='#008000'>** Tancred is impressed, and again tries unsuccessfully not to show it. **</font><br>
[Sat May 28 18:34:06 2005] : <B>Tancred</B>: <font color='#000080'>"Sashi? You coming?"</font><br>
[Sat May 28 18:34:06 2005] : <B>Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>Arno brought a full survival kit, while acknowledging that life in the Chaos Plane is mostly up to luck.</font><br>
[Sat May 28 18:34:21 2005] : <font color='#008000'>** Sashi gets up into the boat **</font><br>
[Sat May 28 18:34:26 2005] : <B>Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>He pulls Tancred aboard; the boat is barely big enough for three people, as long as nobody needs too much stretching space.</font><br>
[Sat May 28 18:35:07 2005] : <font color='#008000'>** Tancred sheds water in all directions, and looks for oars, sails, or some other means of propelling the little craft. **</font><br>
[Sat May 28 18:35:08 2005] : <B>Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>"So you're the know-it-all," Arno says. "Which way?" He shows you a compass; its needle flops about idly.</font><br>
[Sat May 28 18:35:33 2005] : <B>Tancred</B>: <font color='#000080'>"Green thing was that way," Tancred answers, pointing. "I think. Start that way, and I'll ask Menkhda."</font><br>
[Sat May 28 18:35:35 2005] : <B>Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>Arno has a double-bladed oar.</font><br>
[Sat May 28 18:35:47 2005] : <B>Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>(Oh, the green thing was Arno's flare.)</font><br>
[Sat May 28 18:36:50 2005] : <B>Tancred</B>: <font color='#000080'>(Oh, okay, didn't realize. Was the yell also his?)</font><br>

[Sat May 28 18:38:10 2005] : <B>Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>Arno pats a device that looks like four brass salt-shakers bound together.</font><br>

[Sat May 28 18:38:31 2005] : <B>Tancred</B>: <font color='#000080'>"So if anyone saw it, and we leave this place, they miss us completely, yes?"</font><br>

[Sat May 28 20:50:23 2005] : <B>Tancred</B>: <font color='#000080'>Yep.</font><br>
[Sat May 28 20:50:30 2005] : <B>Sashi</B>: <font color='#004040'>with, precisely, what reasoning behind it?</font><br>
[Sat May 28 20:50:31 2005] : <B>Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>He's just a teeny bit insane at the moment.</font><br>
[Sat May 28 20:50:35 2005] : <B>Tancred</B>: <font color='#000080'>Slightly.</font><br>
[Sat May 28 20:50:51 2005] : <B>Tancred</B>: <font color='#000080'>And Kodatmar did promise him that one generally finds what one seeks in the Maelstrom, so there.</font><br>
[Sat May 28 20:51:02 2005] : <B>Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>That's true!</font><br>
[Sat May 28 20:51:24 2005] : <B>Tancred</B>: <font color='#000080'>And he wouldn't give a flying fuck about the Chaosium if it weren't the only link to Lucrecia.</font><br>
[Sat May 28 20:51:48 2005] : <B>Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>Well, unless Lucrecia were fine, in which case he'd have his librarianly responsibility.</font><br>
[Sat May 28 20:51:52 2005] : <B>Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>Which isn't really as strong a hook.</font><br>
[Sat May 28 20:51:54 2005] : <B>Tancred</B>: <font color='#000080'>Well, yeah.</font><br>
[Sat May 28 20:52:46 2005] : <B>Tancred</B>: <font color='#000080'>But, yeah, woman out of noplace with lots of chaos swirling around her begging for a lost love... that's enough like Lucrecia to trigger Tancred's insanity.</font><br>
[Sat May 28 20:53:38 2005] : <B>Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>Okay, time to scram. See ya next time! I hope with Aryk.</font><br>
