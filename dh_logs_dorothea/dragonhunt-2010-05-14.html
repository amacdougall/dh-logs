[Fri May 14 21:15:40 2010] : <b>(7567) Renate</b>: <font color='#000080'>I know <em>that</em> look.</font><br />
[Fri May 14 21:15:43 2010] : <b>(7567) Renate</b>: <font color='#000080'>Yep.</font><br />

[Fri May 14 21:16:29 2010] : <b>(7568) Alan</b>: <font color='#00008c'>Yeah. I hope things work out, she seems really neat.</font><br />
[Fri May 14 21:16:37 2010] : <b>(7567) Renate</b>: <font color='#000080'>I do too. :)</font><br />
[Fri May 14 21:17:14 2010] : <b>(7568) Alan</b>: <font color='#00008c'>Anyway, I'm outta here. See you, folks! Now that you've met and greeted most of the key players in your baronies, things can start happening.</font><br />

[Fri May 14 21:17:49 2010] : <b>(7567) Renate</b>: <font color='#000080'>bye! have a good evening!</font><br />
[Fri May 14 21:18:03 2010] : <b>(7568) Alan</b>: <font color='#00008c'>My main concern about Birch Creek is balancing the Grovekeeper against Adam's thing... they're linked, in the sense that the two personages are interested in one another, but Adam should be the focus in the end.</font><br />
[Fri May 14 21:18:18 2010] : <b>(7567) Renate</b>: <font color='#000080'>Oh, I suspect that can be accomplished. :)</font><br />
[Fri May 14 21:18:41 2010] : <b>(7567) Renate</b>: <font color='#000080'>Renate herself is beginning to suspect that the True King/Great Lord binary is WAY oversimplified.</font><br />
[Fri May 14 21:18:44 2010] : <b>(7568) Alan</b>: <font color='#00008c'>I was trying to arrange for the Grovekeeper to be sort of a big impersonal problem and Adam to be a small-ballooning-to-big personal problem.</font><br />
[Fri May 14 21:18:47 2010] : <b>(7567) Renate</b>: <font color='#000080'>"Two is a ridiculous number" and all that.</font><br />
[Fri May 14 21:19:13 2010] : <b>(7568) Alan</b>: <font color='#00008c'>Trouble is, the Grovekeeper might be big enough to swamp Adam. (Get it? Swamp?)</font><br />
[Fri May 14 21:19:22 2010] : <b>(7568) Alan</b>: <font color='#00008c'>Well, it's no real spoiler to say that the Grovekeeper seems (to Adam) to draw on the same kind of power Adam does.</font><br />
[Fri May 14 21:19:26 2010] : <b>(7568) Alan</b>: <font color='#00008c'>That's why Adam's here.</font><br />
[Fri May 14 21:19:29 2010] : <b>(7567) Renate</b>: <font color='#000080'>indeed</font><br />
[Fri May 14 21:19:35 2010] : <b>(7568) Alan</b>: <font color='#00008c'>You'll hear it from his own mouth shortly.</font><br />
[Fri May 14 21:19:52 2010] : <b>(7568) Alan</b>: <font color='#00008c'>Adam himself is trying to figure out why his powers work (or even if they do, of course).</font><br />
[Fri May 14 21:19:57 2010] : <b>(7568) Alan</b>: <font color='#00008c'>He's not a fool or willingly blind.</font><br />
[Fri May 14 21:20:11 2010] : <b>(7568) Alan</b>: <font color='#00008c'>Even if he does things that are foolish! There's a difference, sort of.</font><br />
[Fri May 14 21:20:19 2010] : <b>(7567) Renate</b>: <font color='#000080'>Oh, sure.</font><br />
[Fri May 14 21:20:30 2010] : <b>(7567) Renate</b>: <font color='#000080'>Adam's not dumb, just bloody selfish.</font><br />
[Fri May 14 21:21:11 2010] : <b>(7568) Alan</b>: <font color='#00008c'>I wish I'd been able to integrate him more into the plot before this, because there's more to him, but I didn't really manage it, so all you got were occasional reports. A failing of my own.</font><br />
[Fri May 14 21:21:21 2010] : <b>(7568) Alan</b>: <font color='#00008c'>Not to say you'd have a better picture of him, but you'd know more.</font><br />
[Fri May 14 21:21:24 2010] : <b>(7567) Renate</b>: <font color='#000080'>Well, we've got time now.</font><br />
[Fri May 14 21:21:29 2010] : <b>(7567) Renate</b>: <font color='#000080'>Maybe some of that can surface. :)</font><br />
[Fri May 14 21:21:52 2010] : <b>(7568) Alan</b>: <font color='#00008c'>Yep. His character flaws are yawning and may yet overwhelm him, but he's got facets, like everyone.</font><br />
[Fri May 14 21:22:20 2010] : <b>(7568) Alan</b>: <font color='#00008c'>And he believes he means well, which can be used to jujitsu him into doing well.</font><br />
[Fri May 14 21:22:31 2010] : <b>(7567) Renate</b>: <font color='#000080'>heh</font><br />
[Fri May 14 21:22:41 2010] : <b>(7567) Renate</b>: <font color='#000080'>maybe Ren won't have to slap him this time</font><br />
[Fri May 14 21:22:57 2010] : <b>(7567) Renate</b>: <font color='#000080'>though if she finds out he's been messing with Margolin girls, she will ride him out of town on a rail HERSELF</font><br />
