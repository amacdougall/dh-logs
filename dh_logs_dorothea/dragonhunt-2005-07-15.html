[Fri Jul 15 22:30:59 2005] : <B>Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>that should indeed be interesting</font><br>
[Fri Jul 15 22:31:08 2005] : <B>Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>Sijan doesn't strike me as the back-down type, though.</font><br>

[Fri Jul 15 22:33:28 2005] : <B>Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>Well, Stormcrow and the Sijan would definitely just follow Rien, to do their jobs.</font><br>
[Fri Jul 15 22:34:04 2005] : <B>Rien</B>: <font color='#004040'>and because Stormcrow's the one with his Planar lock, and if he gets out of range of that then he can take to the planes and they'll have a lot of trouble getting their hands on him again</font><br>

[Fri Jul 15 22:34:45 2005] : <B>Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>Kind of like Kyo Kusanagi's Japanese yelling is much better than if he were yelling in English.</font><br>
