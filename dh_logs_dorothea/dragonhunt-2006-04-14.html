[Fri Apr 14 19:31:17 2006] : <B>(1) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>Since the point of a potion gauntlet is quick access, Marcus adjusts his stance to a shallow and mobile one -- better for dodging and jabbing, but worse for strong attacks or withstanding attack.</font><br>

[Fri Apr 14 23:02:48 2006] : <B>(1) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>I'll tell you right out that she hasn't studied it, or taught it to her people, or anything.</font><br>
[Fri Apr 14 23:02:48 2006] : <B>(2) Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>Though something that would have to take place kind of at arms' length.</font><br>
[Fri Apr 14 23:03:01 2006] : <B>(2) Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>Oh, no, I'm not even going there. What she does with that book is her problem.</font><br>
[Fri Apr 14 23:03:09 2006] : <B>(1) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>Or given it to Stephen of Glenworth, which is the next most obvious scheme.</font><br>
[Fri Apr 14 23:03:16 2006] : <B>(2) Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>And it doesn't become mine unless my fiendish plot succeeds. :)</font><br>
[Fri Apr 14 23:03:23 2006] : <B>(2) Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>Or she gives it to Stephen of Glenworth. Ugh.</font><br>
[Fri Apr 14 23:03:51 2006] : <B>(1) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>Now, I've decided to leave one thing out -- in the Zion game, the Stephen-analogue marched an army into Skyrail Valley after the Baron's death.</font><br>
[Fri Apr 14 23:04:07 2006] : <B>(2) Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>Could happen.</font><br>
[Fri Apr 14 23:04:23 2006] : <B>(1) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>Kodaku was forced to lead a resistance from exile, culminating in a crucial duel. He was defeated, but then his brother came on the scene and blew the Stephen-analogue to high hell.</font><br>
[Fri Apr 14 23:04:25 2006] : <B>(2) Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>Stephen would be dead and shipped if he tried it, though. Renate would not stop until he was.</font><br>
[Fri Apr 14 23:04:42 2006] : <B>(1) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>I can't do it in this one because the timing just isn't right.</font><br>
[Fri Apr 14 23:05:01 2006] : <B>(1) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>So the Glenworth issue will have some other resolution, which may be passing or unsatisfying.</font><br>
[Fri Apr 14 23:05:04 2006] : <B>(2) Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>But hey, guerilla resistance is my thing anyway. :)</font><br>
[Fri Apr 14 23:05:25 2006] : <B>(2) Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>Well, one way to do it is he calls her out again, thinking she'll wuss on him.</font><br>
[Fri Apr 14 23:05:41 2006] : <B>(1) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>Well, the culture is different too. Renate isn't the "let's have a duel, it'll be the perfect solution" type; and Will isn't the "take the victorious enemy behind the woodshed and nuke him" type.</font><br>
[Fri Apr 14 23:05:57 2006] : <B>(2) Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>Renate might. Depends what the stakes are.</font><br>
[Fri Apr 14 23:06:12 2006] : <B>(1) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>Well, maybe it'll come to that; but we'll wait and see how things shake out.</font><br>
[Fri Apr 14 23:06:16 2006] : <B>(2) Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>Stephen's lost his chance in her book. The next time she sees him, she'll be out for blood.</font><br>
[Fri Apr 14 23:06:33 2006] : <B>(1) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>I'm thinking I'll just go through to Chapter 10 after this. There's been more than enough buildup.</font><br>
[Fri Apr 14 23:06:53 2006] : <B>(2) Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>Your game.</font><br>
[Fri Apr 14 23:06:56 2006] : <B>(1) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>I could raise the Soleil-related stakes some more, have more of his agents stirring the pot, but I figure the players are plenty curious already.</font><br>
[Fri Apr 14 23:07:18 2006] : <B>(2) Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>That plus we're quite aware that meeting him is inevitable.</font><br>
[Fri Apr 14 23:07:47 2006] : <B>(1) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>And the chapter intro will have plenty of events in that regard anyway, leading up to the big taking-off-the-rubber-mask chapter cliffhanger.</font><br>

[Fri Apr 14 23:08:20 2006] : <B>(2) Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>Even more obvious than that.</font><br>
[Fri Apr 14 23:08:26 2006] : <B>(1) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>Well, maybe it is dead obvious, but if so, I'll just be disappointed.</font><br>
