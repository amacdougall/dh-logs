[Fri Dec  9 19:13:11 2005] : <B>(1) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>That's apparently the big thing. It wasn't enough for fanfic authors to have Harry and Draco making out, now one of them is always getting pregnant.</font><br>
[Fri Dec  9 19:13:43 2005] : <B>(3) Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>eh, well, there is precedent... the Monkey chronicles have a male pregnancy in 'em</font><br>
[Fri Dec  9 19:14:06 2005] : <B>(1) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>When you consider that the majority of the authors are supposedly young to middle-aged women, it makes a slight amount of sense that they'd project feminine issues on the subjects... but I'm not really qualified even to guess.</font><br>
[Fri Dec  9 19:14:21 2005] : <B>(1) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>I just point and gasp.</font><br>

[Fri Dec  9 19:19:57 2005] : <B>(3) Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>here or in IM?</font><br>

[Fri Dec  9 19:20:51 2005] : <B>(1) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>I might misuse it!</font><br>
[Fri Dec  9 19:21:02 2005] : <B>(1) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>And I hadn't checked my blog comments, actually.</font><br>

[Fri Dec  9 19:21:43 2005] : <B>(1) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>But that's Heinlein, anyway.</font><br>
[Fri Dec  9 19:21:51 2005] : <B>(2) Aryk</B>: <font color='#000080'>I liked Friday.</font><br>
[Fri Dec  9 19:21:56 2005] : <B>(1) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>No, I read it when I was a wee sprout. I don't remember most of the particulars.</font><br>
[Fri Dec  9 19:21:57 2005] : <B>(2) Aryk</B>: <font color='#000080'>I don't remember that line, though.</font><br>
[Fri Dec  9 19:22:07 2005] : <B>(1) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>Some sort of World War III scenario near the end, if I recall.</font><br>

[Fri Dec  9 19:24:23 2005] : <B>(1) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>A lot of science fiction is utopian, but a lot is cautionary. We can't dismiss the whole "AI-controlled super-robot kills humanity" genre.</font><br>
[Fri Dec  9 19:24:29 2005] : <B>(3) Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>yeah, and isn't it the slowest and stupidest movie ever?</font><br>
[Fri Dec  9 19:24:44 2005] : <B>(2) Aryk</B>: <font color='#000080'>No, that would be Vanilla Sky.</font><br>
[Fri Dec  9 19:24:49 2005] : <B>(3) Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>(except, actually, for the HAL parts)</font><br>
[Fri Dec  9 19:24:54 2005] : <B>(3) Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>oh, never saw that one</font><br>
[Fri Dec  9 19:24:58 2005] : <B>(1) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>Bah, Vanilla Sky was great. I wouldn't watch it twice.</font><br>
[Fri Dec  9 19:25:04 2005] : <B>(1) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>It was definitely slow.</font><br>
[Fri Dec  9 19:25:20 2005] : <B>(1) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>But well worth watching, for the visuals alone.</font><br>
[Fri Dec  9 19:25:39 2005] : <B>(1) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>And some really great scenes, both of plain old emotional acting, and science-fiction tripouts.</font><br>

[Fri Dec  9 19:25:55 2005] : <B>(1) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>How can you not love that?</font><br>
[Fri Dec  9 19:26:18 2005] : <B>(1) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>Ah well. Let's not spoil it. D, you should watch it and make your own decision.</font><br>
[Fri Dec  9 19:26:24 2005] : <B>(3) Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>okay</font><br>
[Fri Dec  9 19:26:33 2005] : <B>(1) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>If you liked, say, The Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind, you might like Vanilla Sky.</font><br>

[Fri Dec  9 19:26:37 2005] : <B>(1) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>Rather in the same vein.</font><br>
[Fri Dec  9 19:26:47 2005] : <B>(3) Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>Haven't seen that one either, though I hear good things.</font><br>
[Fri Dec  9 19:27:04 2005] : <B>(1) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>Well, watch either one, then decide if you'd watch something in many ways similar.</font><br>
[Fri Dec  9 19:27:34 2005] : <B>(1) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>They both focus on technological influence on emotions and relationships, with extensive dreamlike imagery and an emphasis on visual style and mood.</font><br>

[Fri Dec  9 19:28:12 2005] : <B>(3) Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>might be worth getting them both</font><br>
[Fri Dec  9 19:28:20 2005] : <B>(1) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>Vanilla Sky either plods or soars, depending on your taste for it; Eternal Sunshine is more tightly told.</font><br>
[Fri Dec  9 19:28:24 2005] : <B>(3) Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>just for comparison purposes</font><br>
[Fri Dec  9 19:28:46 2005] : <B>(3) Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>(bah! you can take the kid out of comp lit, but...)</font><br>
[Fri Dec  9 19:28:57 2005] : <B>(1) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>It's one of those situations where for all I know, the running time is the same.</font><br>
[Fri Dec  9 19:29:38 2005] : <B>(2) Aryk</B>: <font color='#000080'>I walked out of that movie feeling cheated.  And I thought most of it was just unnecessary.</font><br>
[Fri Dec  9 19:29:38 2005] : <B>(1) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>Okay, just checked, and Vanilla Sky is a half-hour longer.</font><br>
