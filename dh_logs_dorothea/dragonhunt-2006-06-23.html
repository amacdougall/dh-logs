"I don't understand what went wrong, though I've spent two years asking myself how I caused it and what I should have done to prevent it. And through my own stubborn fault, I understand nothing of what these years have been like for you. I don't know you. I don't know who you are. I don't know how to treat you as anything but a stranger."</font><br>
[Fri Jun 23 21:08:04 2006] : <B>(1) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>"I'm not asking for a magical remedy. I just want to be able to get to know you again. You have changed too... more than I have."</font><br>

[Fri Jun 23 21:12:01 2006] : <B>(1) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>"One thing I told Rien, before you came in... I definitely have changed from the person I was then. That much is true beyond doubt."</font><br>
[Fri Jun 23 21:12:50 2006] : <B>(1) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>"I was selfish and thoughtless. I felt that you were a better daughter than I was a son... and yet father was trying to groom me as heir. I felt I was being pushed to excel beyond my abilities.

[Fri Jun 23 21:13:22 2006] : <B>(1) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>"So, out of... sheer <i>petulance</i>.. I ran off to join Heaven, thinking I would do a two or three-year tour in the Patchworks and come back a dashing hero."</font><br>
[Fri Jun 23 21:14:07 2006] : <B>(1) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>"Being chosen as an Arc Knight was flattering, but the training was more than humbling enough to cut me back down. And during and after that... I came to realize just how shallow my original motivations were."</font><br>

[Fri Jun 23 21:15:48 2006] : <B>(1) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>"I felt that you had more <i>heart</i>. Father felt it too. And we were right, I think. What was wrong was leaving you because of it... instead of learning from you."</font><br>
[Fri Jun 23 21:16:04 2006] : <B>(1) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>"Now, I hope to remedy that mistake."</font><br>
[Fri Jun 23 21:16:54 2006] : <B>(2) Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>"So... that's it? That's all there was? You wanted to show me up, even though you already had in every way that mattered to anyone?"</font><br>
