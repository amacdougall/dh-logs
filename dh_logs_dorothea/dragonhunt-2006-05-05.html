[Fri May  5 19:48:00 2006] : <B>(3) Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>Actually, Renate's for clearing a chokepoint also. We can hold it until the Cloudgatherers get here, and it gets more people out faster.</font><br>
[Fri May  5 19:48:09 2006] : <B>(1) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>(Sneaky also means slower; and although the Cloudgatherers are up there evidently fighting, Ander did say that the death squads were "barely sufficient" to wipe out the whole zone if unopposed.</font><br>
[Fri May  5 19:48:32 2006] : <B>(1) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>(Which surely means "entirely sufficient" for killing a significant percentage.)</font><br>

All we can hope is that those who don't want to evacuate with us will be those that would fit the category of that percentage of those that would be offed by the milita.)</font><br>
[Fri May  5 19:50:14 2006] : <B>(1) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>All right; there are three roads leading down into Pineapple, two into Bluedog, one is actually a dock on one of the several smallish rivers that lead to the sea, and one leads up into the mountains.</font><br>
[Fri May  5 19:50:40 2006] : <B>(1) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>The river dock has the least guard presence, but also has the lowest throughput: there are only so many boats moored there.</font><br>

[Fri May  5 19:51:45 2006] : <B>(2) Rien</B>: <font color='#004000'>Is there one that heads out of the city, but not up into the mountains?</font><br>
[Fri May  5 19:51:55 2006] : <B>(3) Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>Pineapple would also be okay, but we know that's already being hit, so Bluedog seems smarter.</font><br>
[Fri May  5 19:52:05 2006] : <B>(1) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>The rest are about even; if the ones you saw at Bluedog are good examples, each one has six heavy infantry with breastplates, shields, and axes; three archers with short bows; and one mage or cleric of some sort.</font><br>
[Fri May  5 19:52:22 2006] : <B>(2) Rien</B>: <font color='#004000'>(Actually, judging about what I gleaned of population, it'd be about seeing how the other 7/8 live.)</font><br>
[Fri May  5 19:52:40 2006] : <B>(3) Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>Whew. Tall order. Well, we'll see what we can do.</font><br>
[Fri May  5 19:53:08 2006] : <B>(3) Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>I say Aryk and Rien hit 'em with area-of-effect spells from hiding. Then we'll see.</font><br>
[Fri May  5 19:53:27 2006] : <B>(1) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>There are also two-man patrols, maybe eight more people per checkpoints, wandering the streets to catch people sneaking.</font><br>
[Fri May  5 19:53:46 2006] : <B>(3) Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>Take them as they come, I guess. If we can wipe a few out before they spread the alarm, great.</font><br>
[Fri May  5 19:53:59 2006] : <B>(3) Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>But taking them out is part of holding the chokepoint, to my mind.</font><br>
[Fri May  5 19:54:02 2006] : <B>(1) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>At least one person in each unit has a bugle or horn of some sort.</font><br>

[Fri May  5 20:03:00 2006] : <B>(1) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>Bored. The action has been at a stalemate since the last day's fighting.

[Fri May  5 23:33:35 2006] : <B>(1) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>He knows she's a threat, but he also knows she can just smoke-bomb out, so he'd decide to ignore her as much as possible.</font><br>
[Fri May  5 23:34:05 2006] : <B>(3) Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>She is a persistent little cuss.</font><br>
[Fri May  5 23:36:08 2006] : <B>(3) Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>So do we get to call ourselves dragonhunters now? And is there a big ceremony and stuff?</font><br>
[Fri May  5 23:36:28 2006] : <B>(1) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>Hey, Fire Stingray was already a thing.</font><br>
[Fri May  5 23:36:40 2006] : <B>(1) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>I mean, you fought him off, at least.</font><br>
[Fri May  5 23:37:06 2006] : <B>(3) Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>Yeah, but nobody actually saw us except Lady Lyria.</font><br>
[Fri May  5 23:37:14 2006] : <B>(3) Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>IIRC, anyway.</font><br>
[Fri May  5 23:37:25 2006] : <B>(3) Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>Now the Cloudgatherers can vouch for us.</font><br>
[Fri May  5 23:37:41 2006] : <B>(1) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>True.</font><br>
[Fri May  5 23:37:55 2006] : <B>(1) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>You've always been dragonhunters in our hearts.</font><br>
[Fri May  5 23:37:57 2006] : <B>(3) Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>And Renate can say that she fought alongside Barracuda Jones. She considers that quite an honor.</font><br>
[Fri May  5 23:38:00 2006] : <B>(3) Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>awwwwww</font><br>
[Fri May  5 23:39:02 2006] : <B>(3) Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>Oh, Renate has a request to make of Old Wolf, come to that.</font><br>
[Fri May  5 23:40:16 2006] : <B>(3) Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>Not a major one. And I think he'll be willing. But we'll see.</font><br>
[Fri May  5 23:40:32 2006] : <B>(2) Rien</B>: <font color='#004000'>And the stuff with Ander.</font><br>
[Fri May  5 23:40:43 2006] : <B>(2) Rien</B>: <font color='#004000'>Kurtzviel, that is.</font><br>
[Fri May  5 23:40:47 2006] : <B>(3) Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>Oh, crap. You're going to make me go through with that, aren't you?</font><br>
[Fri May  5 23:40:56 2006] : <B>(2) Rien</B>: <font color='#004000'>Yes.</font><br>

[Fri May  5 23:41:14 2006] : <B>(2) Rien</B>: <font color='#004000'>It's for Renate's good.</font><br>
[Fri May  5 23:42:10 2006] : <B>(3) Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>Yes, and Renate resists what's good for her kicking and screaming, you know she does.</font><br>
[Fri May  5 23:42:17 2006] : <B>(3) Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>But okay. For Rien, she'll do it.</font><br>
[Fri May  5 23:42:30 2006] : <B>(3) Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>And, indirectly, for Sabine.</font><br>
[Fri May  5 23:42:50 2006] : <B>(3) Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>Who would rant and rave and stomp her feet if she knew what her big sister had been up to tonight.</font><br>
[Fri May  5 23:43:15 2006] : <B>(3) Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>So can we catch a ride with the Cloudgatherers back to the mainland?</font><br>
[Fri May  5 23:43:32 2006] : <B>(1) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>I don't see why not.</font><br>
[Fri May  5 23:43:44 2006] : <B>(3) Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>Coolness.</font><br>
[Fri May  5 23:43:48 2006] : <B>(1) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>They're going to have a hard time getting a ship too, in the tumult.</font><br>
[Fri May  5 23:43:57 2006] : <B>(1) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>Everybody and his brother is going to want out of or into town now.</font><br>
[Fri May  5 23:44:18 2006] : <B>(1) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>You'll probably end up in some cargo hold along side a bunch of barrels of fish sauce or something.</font><br>
[Fri May  5 23:44:22 2006] : <B>(3) Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>Aryk can bunk in with Old Wolf. :)</font><br>
[Fri May  5 23:44:36 2006] : <B>(3) Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>Do the lad good.</font><br>
[Fri May  5 23:45:14 2006] : <B>(3) Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>And Old Wolf can gather more data. I'm sure he'll put the opportunity to good use.</font><br>
[Fri May  5 23:45:34 2006] : <B>(3) Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>The Quillions aren't stuck, are they?</font><br>
[Fri May  5 23:45:40 2006] : <B>(3) Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>Because that would kinda suck.</font><br>
[Fri May  5 23:46:19 2006] : <B>(1) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>Nope, they got that airship going pretty much as soon as they realized the war was still at the boiling point.</font><br>
[Fri May  5 23:46:25 2006] : <B>(3) Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>Smart.</font><br>
[Fri May  5 23:46:44 2006] : <B>(1) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>They're long gone. Left you an apologetic telegraph and some money for a ship home.</font><br>
[Fri May  5 23:46:58 2006] : <B>(3) Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>heh, that'll come in handy</font><br>
[Fri May  5 23:47:20 2006] : <B>(3) Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>Renate's going to have to apologize profusely to Jashain Juste.</font><br>

[Fri May  5 23:47:45 2006] : <B>(1) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>Well, he did design it to fight in.</font><br>
[Fri May  5 23:47:55 2006] : <B>(1) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>I think the complete destruction of a suit of armor kind of proves it's being put to use.</font><br>
[Fri May  5 23:48:07 2006] : <B>(3) Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>Yes, but losing something that a *friend* made you... Renate feels awful about it.</font><br>
