[Fri May  9 18:50:44 2008] : <b>(7044) Alan</b>: <font color='#000080'>Suddenly, for Sashi, everything is very bright.</font><br />

[Fri May  9 18:52:05 2008] : <b>(7044) Alan</b>: <font color='#000080'>Her eyes are not used to the light; as if she had been in utter darkness for hours.</font><br />

[Fri May  9 18:54:03 2008] : <b>(7044) Alan</b>: <font color='#000080'>Now, she sits in a small room, perhaps the size of a student apartment in Eldorado; there is a writing-desk next to a window, a door leading into a simple bathroom, a seam in the wall where a bed probably swings down.</font><br />
[Fri May  9 18:55:08 2008] : <b>(7044) Alan</b>: <font color='#000080'>The writing-desk holds a closed leatherbound book, an inkwell, and a beautiful gold and black-laquer fountain pen; the book and pen are the only objects of  beauty in the room.</font><br />

[Fri May  9 18:55:52 2008] : <b>(7044) Alan</b>: <font color='#000080'>The window has a poor view of what appears to be a garden, during late twilight, all dry leaves and dead grass as of early winter, before the snowfalls.</font><br />

[Fri May  9 18:56:43 2008] : <b>(7044) Alan</b>: <font color='#000080'>Unless, perhaps, the seam in the wall is the door, but a quick tug on the top-mounted handle proves it to be a bed after all.</font><br />

[Fri May  9 18:58:50 2008] : <b>(7044) Alan</b>: <font color='#000080'>What is Sashi's course of action, if any?</font><br />
[Fri May  9 18:59:45 2008] : <b>(7042) Sashi</b>: <font color='#003300'>Frist, find anything that might be used as a weapon.  Perhaps the pen could be used as a shiv.  Then try and open the window.  Failing that, try to break it.</font><br />
[Fri May  9 19:00:07 2008] : <b>(7042) Sashi</b>: <font color='#003300'>Or try to find any kind of concealed door.</font><br />
[Fri May  9 19:01:39 2008] : <b>(7044) Alan</b>: <font color='#000080'>All right. The pen could certainly be used to stab people in a pinch. And it's not filled with ink yet; it seems brand spanking new.</font><br />
[Fri May  9 19:02:08 2008] : <b>(7044) Alan</b>: <font color='#000080'>The window is not meant to open; the pane fits right into the window-frame, which is of a material you can't quite place.</font><br />

[Fri May  9 19:02:47 2008] : <b>(7044) Alan</b>: <font color='#000080'>Attempting to break it, by any means up through swinging the chair at it, causes it to spit ragged green sparks and otherwise remain utterly unmoved, not even vibrated.</font><br />
[Fri May  9 19:03:27 2008] : <b>(7043) Tancred</b>: <font color='#000080'>(Sashi could tattoo people to death.)</font><br />

[Fri May  9 19:04:03 2008] : <b>(7044) Alan</b>: <font color='#000080'>The room as a whole is put together out of simple and largely seamless materials; even the bathroom has no exposed plumbing or other weaknesses.</font><br />
