[Sat Aug 21 17:02:59 2004] : <B>Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>5d6.takeHighest(2), for example, gives the two highest results out of the die roll.</font><br>
[Sat Aug 21 17:03:26 2004] : <B>Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>This could be useful for luck rolls. [2d20.takeHighest(1)] -> [7] = (7), for instance.</font><br>
[Sat Aug 21 17:03:47 2004] : <B>Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>You can chain die functions, as in [2d20.takeHighest(1).attack(15, 5, 19)] -> [3,5] = (8) vs AC 15 Miss!</font><br>

[Sat Aug 21 17:03:58 2004] : <B>Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>And wow, those must have been two pathetic rolls.</font><br>

[Sat Aug 21 17:04:14 2004] : <B>Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>I also found a new one: 1d20.dc(DC, modifier)</font><br>
[Sat Aug 21 17:04:22 2004] : <B>Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>As in [1d20.dc(15, 5)] -> [7,5] = (12) vs DC 15 Failure!</font><br>

[Sat Aug 21 17:05:04 2004] : <B>Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>The attack roller is very handy in that it resolves critical hits by itself, and cuts out a certain amount of mathematical overhead on our parts... the DC one, less so.</font><br>
[Sat Aug 21 17:05:25 2004] : <B>Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>I think I'm just going to find it easier than typing [1d20 + 4] -> [5,4] = (9) vs. DC 15</font><br>
[Sat Aug 21 17:05:33 2004] : <B>Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>Saves a few keystrokes, is all.</font><br>
[Sat Aug 21 17:05:50 2004] : <B>Dorothea</B>: <font color='#000080'>well, I think several of the rollers could be better conceived of as interactive; I just can't keep track of all those numbers at once</font><br>

[Sat Aug 21 17:06:21 2004] : <B>Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>I use that RoboType program to do that for me. You can make it produce a series of popup prompt dialogs.</font><br>

[Sat Aug 21 17:07:36 2004] : <B>Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>And the same for the .attack modifier. I type "att" and hit space, and it pops up with a prompt saying "evade, accuracy, critical".</font><br>

[Sat Aug 21 17:10:22 2004] : <B>Dorothea</B>: <font color='#000080'>I'd like to do a quick strategy huddle when the game starts, please, if we can possibly avoid being immediately attacked. :)</font><br>
[Sat Aug 21 17:10:26 2004] : <B>Dorothea</B>: <font color='#000080'>okay, present away</font><br>
[Sat Aug 21 17:10:26 2004] : <B>Rien</B>: <font color='#004040'>me, just barely</font><br>
[Sat Aug 21 17:10:29 2004] : <B>Aryk</B>: <font color='#000080'>Oh man...</font><br>

[Sat Aug 21 17:10:56 2004] : <B>Dorothea</B>: <font color='#000080'>oo! oo! I'm aware! :)</font><br>
[Sat Aug 21 17:11:00 2004] : <B>Aryk</B>: <font color='#000080'>Just from what you said last time we played</font><br>
[Sat Aug 21 17:11:00 2004] : <B>Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>It's up on the website, actually.</font><br>
[Sat Aug 21 17:11:09 2004] : <B>Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>Okay, I'll run it down very quickly just in case.</font><br>
[Sat Aug 21 17:11:13 2004] : <B>Aryk</B>: <font color='#000080'>No whammies!</font><br>
[Sat Aug 21 17:11:26 2004] : <B>Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>First, you now have "fortune" or "misfortune" points equal to double your luck modifier.</font><br>
[Sat Aug 21 17:11:53 2004] : <B>Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>These points still work like they used to: one point to add your luck bonus to something, one point to roll twice in advance, two points to reroll after the fact.</font><br>
[Sat Aug 21 17:12:12 2004] : <B>Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>However, when you are at zero luck, you may continue to use luck effects, by incurring future bad luck.</font><br>
[Sat Aug 21 17:12:15 2004] : <B>Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>This is called "pressing your luck."</font><br>
[Sat Aug 21 17:12:47 2004] : <B>Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>There are a few new <a href="http://www.alanmacdougall.com/dragonhunt/feats.php">feats</a> to manipulate luck -- if you're interested in those, cool.</font><br>
[Sat Aug 21 17:12:52 2004] : <B>Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>If not, you now know all the new stuff. :)</font><br>
[Sat Aug 21 17:13:00 2004] : <B>Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>But that's not the new rule I was going to present.</font><br>
[Sat Aug 21 17:13:39 2004] : <B>Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>The way the feat progression matches against fighting level availability, Aryk and possible Renate have a level of their fighting style that is "under water," to borrow a financial term, until level 8.</font><br>
[Sat Aug 21 17:13:58 2004] : <B>Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>In fact, I expect Rien has the same problem as well.</font><br>
[Sat Aug 21 17:14:27 2004] : <B>Dorothea</B>: <font color='#000080'>indeed</font><br>
[Sat Aug 21 17:14:43 2004] : <B>Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>I set it up this way because I wanted people to have to use feats to get their styles; but I also wanted to withhold the real goodies so that things keep appearing throughout the game.</font><br>

[Sat Aug 21 17:15:17 2004] : <B>Dorothea</B>: <font color='#000080'>my, what a lovely image that is</font><br>
[Sat Aug 21 17:15:20 2004] : <B>Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>However, you're assumed to be practicing those new skills -- you don't miraculously acquire them.</font><br>

[Sat Aug 21 17:16:07 2004] : <B>Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>Anyway, for you fighter types, when you're only one level away from mastering the style level you've already bought&#8212;i.e. when you're level 7...</font><br>
[Sat Aug 21 17:16:32 2004] : <B>Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>...you can pull off any specific level 4 move by making a Warcraft check to get it right.</font><br>
[Sat Aug 21 17:16:38 2004] : <B>Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>A failure means you botched the move in some way.</font><br>

[Sat Aug 21 17:17:01 2004] : <B>Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>Just like a skater flubbing his ubertrick at the X-Games when he should have just done something he was comfortable with.</font><br>

[Sat Aug 21 17:17:24 2004] : <B>Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>You forgot the astronomical constant, but close.</font><br>

[Sat Aug 21 17:17:41 2004] : <B>Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>Ahem, cosmological constant. I was trying, anyway.</font><br>
[Sat Aug 21 17:17:41 2004] : <B>Rien</B>: <font color='#004040'>how could I?</font><br>
[Sat Aug 21 17:17:55 2004] : <B>Dorothea</B>: <font color='#000080'>*snicker*</font><br>
[Sat Aug 21 17:18:49 2004] : <B>Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>No, it will vary from move to move. I'm going to call it 10 plus 5 for a special move, 8 for a super, and 11 for a desperation.</font><br>
[Sat Aug 21 17:19:16 2004] : <B>Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>This means that, depending of course on your modifiers, you're more than likely to get a normal move right, but it gets trickier for the big stunts.</font><br>
[Sat Aug 21 17:19:36 2004] : <B>Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>Of course, spending Luck on those rolls makes them statistically more likely, so a desperation could be worth the risk.</font><br>
[Sat Aug 21 17:19:48 2004] : <B>Rien</B>: <font color='#004040'>which means...</font><br>
[Sat Aug 21 17:19:52 2004] : <font color='#008000'>** Rien pokes Aryk **</font><br>
[Sat Aug 21 17:20:07 2004] : <B>Rien</B>: <font color='#004040'>you should be spending those feat points on warcraft more often</font><br>

[Sat Aug 21 17:21:39 2004] : <B>Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>Every now and then, you'll have the misfortune of fighting something or someone that works very differently from anything you've practiced against.</font><br>

[Sat Aug 21 17:22:20 2004] : <B>Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>Just like, as Matt can attest, playing a fighting game against a smart opponent; or, as I can attest, fighting someone in the ring.</font><br>

[Sat Aug 21 17:22:53 2004] : <B>Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>Normal fights, even against bizarre fighting styles, aren't likely to require Warcraft checks; Aaron's speech about all styles having commonalities was correct.</font><br>

[Sat Aug 21 20:57:00 2004] : <B>Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>You can call a shot to the wings, and if you do sufficient damage you can get a crippling effect.</font><br>
[Sat Aug 21 20:57:17 2004] : <B>Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>Then they'll use the dragon-magic equivalent of a mending potion. Costs them a move or an action, just like a potion.</font><br>
[Sat Aug 21 20:57:31 2004] : <B>Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>But you can't just maim them outright.</font><br>
[Sat Aug 21 20:57:45 2004] : <B>Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>Hm. Possibly easier to bind them somehow. I will think on this.</font><br>
[Sat Aug 21 20:57:45 2004] : <B>Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>So it'll slow them down. It's not a bad idea.</font><br>
[Sat Aug 21 20:58:05 2004] : <B>Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>If you hit a dragon on the wing with a crippling effect, he'll just fall a ways before he can heal and pull out of the fall.</font><br>
[Sat Aug 21 20:58:32 2004] : <B>Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>Of course, if you attack a dragon with a concerted barrage of such attacks, he has other options.</font><br>
[Sat Aug 21 20:58:44 2004] : <B>Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>Honey, dragons ALWAYS have other options. :)</font><br>
[Sat Aug 21 20:58:50 2004] : <B>Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>Like bringing up an anti-missile shield spell, or dropping to the ground and attacking from there, or whatever.</font><br>
[Sat Aug 21 20:59:37 2004] : <B>Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>No, I suspect the trick is what it usually is, and that's all I'll say.</font><br>
[Sat Aug 21 20:59:47 2004] : <B>Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>I should warn you ahead of time that dragons are notoriously fast for their size. One of the many things that make them dangerous. Scholars with a decent knowledge of the human metabolism have theories about hyperoxygenated blood and stuff.</font><br>
[Sat Aug 21 20:59:59 2004] : <B>Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>The trick is getting the dragon to waste as many attacks as possible... THEN we move in and kill it.</font><br>
[Sat Aug 21 21:00:08 2004] : <B>Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>They get two actions per round, on separate initiative rolls.</font><br>
[Sat Aug 21 21:00:12 2004] : <B>Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>Right. We'll need some Matrix Dynamics, stat.</font><br>

[Sat Aug 21 21:02:16 2004] : <B>Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>And yeah, I was kind of hoping you guys wouldn't just randomly attack them.</font><br>
[Sat Aug 21 21:02:20 2004] : <B>Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>just to make you happy</font><br>
[Sat Aug 21 21:02:31 2004] : <B>Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>It would have reflected badly on your characters, honestly.</font><br>
[Sat Aug 21 21:02:51 2004] : <B>Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>nah, it was gonna be swipe the stone and get out, worst-case</font><br>
[Sat Aug 21 21:03:31 2004] : <B>Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>I can see we're going to have to deal decisively with Aryk's demon issues, though.</font><br>
[Sat Aug 21 21:03:32 2004] : <B>Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>Right. It was just one of those cases where if they <i>were</i> enemies, quick action would have been the only good course... but you couldn't in conscience assume that.</font><br>
[Sat Aug 21 21:03:41 2004] : <B>Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>Bingo.</font><br>
[Sat Aug 21 21:04:39 2004] : <B>Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>The Storm Wolves aren't exactly Soleil's believers, but they're under contract to him for the moment.</font><br>

[Sat Aug 21 21:05:00 2004] : <B>Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>Mercs. Gotcha.</font><br>
[Sat Aug 21 21:05:17 2004] : <B>Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>Well, they only work for things they agree with (or don't care about).</font><br>
[Sat Aug 21 21:05:25 2004] : <B>Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>They wouldn't work for Dark Eternal.</font><br>
[Sat Aug 21 21:05:29 2004] : <B>Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>Sure. That's how Renate'll be if she's ever a merc.</font><br>
[Sat Aug 21 21:05:35 2004] : <B>Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>And it could happen.</font><br>

[Sat Aug 21 21:06:59 2004] : <B>Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>but Aryk is terribly guileless, isn't he?</font><br>
[Sat Aug 21 21:07:02 2004] : <B>Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>There may not be any such thing as Hell. Answers will come along, though, sooner or later.</font><br>

[Sat Aug 21 21:07:11 2004] : <B>Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>yep</font><br>
[Sat Aug 21 21:07:33 2004] : <B>Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>Good role-playing, there. I'm always pleased with how Matt manages to avoid letting any of his own intelligence seep into Aryk.</font><br>

[Sat Aug 21 21:07:50 2004] : <B>Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>He warned me that Aryk was going to go spla over Artagus.</font><br>
[Sat Aug 21 21:08:00 2004] : <B>Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>Quite reasonable.</font><br>
[Sat Aug 21 21:08:02 2004] : <B>Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>So I kinda inched up there to keep the situation from deteriorating. :)</font><br>
