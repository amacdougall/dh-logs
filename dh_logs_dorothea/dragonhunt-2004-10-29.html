[Fri Oct 29 20:06:08 2004] : <B>Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>As you prowl about Glenworth, you can't see many qualititative differences between it and Karlbotel: it's completely different, of course, and far inferior to your discerning eye, but it has all the same basic amenities.</font><br>
[Fri Oct 29 20:06:39 2004] : <B>Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>There's even a militia training field in the same general area; one that is currently being decorated for some sort of fair.</font><br>

[Fri Oct 29 20:07:24 2004] : <B>Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>Which is odd, because it's not any festival season you can think of; and anyway, most fairs and dances are better set in the town square.</font><br>
[Fri Oct 29 20:07:55 2004] : <B>Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>Decorated how?</font><br>
[Fri Oct 29 20:08:11 2004] : <B>Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>You're also noticing an unexpected number of mercenaries bumming around the town, ranging from caravan bravo to coat-of-arms knight.</font><br>
[Fri Oct 29 20:08:38 2004] : <B>Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>Sorel didn't point it out, probably because he's too accustomed to the Patchwork Kingdoms, where wandering warriors are a plague on the streets.</font><br>
[Fri Oct 29 20:08:41 2004] : <B>Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>Are they mobilizing at the moment, or just hanging out?</font><br>

[Fri Oct 29 20:09:19 2004] : <B>Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>They're setting up lists.</font><br>
[Fri Oct 29 20:09:36 2004] : <B>Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>Ah. Well, that's better than what Renate had first thought of.</font><br>

[Fri Oct 29 20:11:29 2004] : <B>Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>I assume Renate and Sorel would both avoid dropping by the manor house or the inn this time?</font><br>
[Fri Oct 29 20:11:45 2004] : <B>Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>Since the manor is where all the Heaven types are, and Lehron has the inn covered.</font><br>

[Fri Oct 29 20:13:36 2004] : <B>Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>Then you rendezvous back at your camp.</font><br>
[Fri Oct 29 20:14:07 2004] : <B>Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>Lehron has the scoop on the tournament: "Heaven's presence here is an open secret. They're letting gossip spread, probably on purpose."</font><br>

[Fri Oct 29 20:19:41 2004] : <B>Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>"Thanks, figured that one out. Lehron, where are the mercenaries staying?"</font><br>

[Fri Oct 29 20:21:46 2004] : <B>Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>"We could systematically search houses. I could go door to door as a shoe salesman or something while you two sneak in the back."</font><br>

[Fri Oct 29 20:23:29 2004] : <B>Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>"Yes. Even though I didn't go armed, they figured me for a brawler, and told me to go to the manor."</font><br>
