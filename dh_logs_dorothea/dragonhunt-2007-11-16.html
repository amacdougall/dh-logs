[Fri Nov 16 19:37:17 2007] : <b>(3840) Alan</b>: <font color='#000080'>The road has bare dirt and that dry moss all around it for as far as you can see; there is an occasional dead shrub sticking up out of the ground, and once you pass a thin gray monolith that rises to about a meter and a half in height.
