[Sat Apr 16 19:24:49 2011] : <b>(103) Alan</b>: <font color='#612769'>It has been heavily reinforced, so that dispelling it would take time and effort.</font><br />
[Sat Apr 16 19:25:12 2011] : <b>(103) Alan</b>: <font color='#612769'>Clearly whoever established the magical defense wanted it to stand up to a determined assault by a master spellcaster.</font><br />

[Sat Apr 16 19:25:47 2011] : <b>(104) Rien</b>: <font color='#263607'>Can Rien also get a peek inside the alchemy lab?</font><br />
[Sat Apr 16 19:26:18 2011] : <b>(103) Alan</b>: <font color='#612769'>By the way, the golden box around the apartment blocks his magical sight in. It probably blocks Rialto's sight back out.</font><br />
[Sat Apr 16 19:26:35 2011] : <b>(103) Alan</b>: <font color='#612769'>As for the alchemy lab, it has no such defense, but that means that if Father White has magical sight, Rien might get spotted.</font><br />

[Sat Apr 16 19:27:19 2011] : <b>(103) Alan</b>: <font color='#612769'>It would be a calculated risk.</font><br />
[Sat Apr 16 19:28:20 2011] : <b>(104) Rien</b>: <font color='#263607'>Very quick peek, then hustle out of there.</font><br />

[Sat Apr 16 19:30:08 2011] : <b>(103) Alan</b>: <font color='#612769'>Okay; the maid ducks down as well, clearly wanting to just follow Rien's lead.</font><br />
[Sat Apr 16 19:30:53 2011] : <b>(103) Alan</b>: <font color='#612769'>All Rien sees in the alchemy lab is some standard equipment, with some fluids glowing very faintly. It looks like only "craft" alchemy is going on -- alchemical processes which create magical potions without requiring magical talent from the alchemist.</font><br />
[Sat Apr 16 19:31:12 2011] : <b>(103) Alan</b>: <font color='#612769'>He doesn't know enough about alchemy to guess what potions are in the works just from a glance at the magical signature.</font><br />
[Sat Apr 16 19:31:42 2011] : <b>(103) Alan</b>: <font color='#612769'>But craft alchemy creates only simple potions. The really interesting stuff requires a master alchemist.</font><br />

[Sat Apr 16 19:32:16 2011] : <b>(104) Rien</b>: <font color='#263607'>So no truth serums or lower-the-mental-defenses stuff.</font><br />
[Sat Apr 16 19:32:26 2011] : <b>(103) Alan</b>: <font color='#612769'>Truth, obedience, "love," are all potions that exist more in myth than in reality.</font><br />

[Sat Apr 16 21:16:13 2011] : <b>(102) Renate</b>: <font color='#000080'>"We settle the noncombatant first," says Renate firmly. "Then we go raise hell."</font><br />

[Sat Apr 16 21:16:43 2011] : <b>(103) Alan</b>: <font color='#612769'>"Okay, okay... I'll watch the fort and stuff."</font><br />
[Sat Apr 16 21:17:20 2011] : <b>(102) Renate</b>: <font color='#000080'>(Okay, so Ren will take Mistress Emily where she wishes and come back. That frees up Gwydion to help with the escape.)</font><br />
[Sat Apr 16 21:19:23 2011] : <b>(103) Alan</b>: <font color='#612769'>If you don't mind just riding Gwydion, the process is very quick. She only lives about ten minutes' walk away, which is next to nothing for Gwydion; even at a brisk canter, he's nearly silent.</font><br />
[Sat Apr 16 21:19:40 2011] : <b>(102) Renate</b>: <font color='#000080'>If Gwydion doesn't mind, Renate certainly doesn't!</font><br />
[Sat Apr 16 21:20:31 2011] : <b>(103) Alan</b>: <font color='#612769'>Riding him is more like riding in a strut-suspension carriage with rubber wheels -- a luxury Renate experienced once in Andragar, and which struck her as almost indecently comfortable.</font><br />
[Sat Apr 16 21:20:55 2011] : <b>(103) Alan</b>: <font color='#612769'>In just a few minutes, Gwydion and Renate are back and ready for action.</font><br />
[Sat Apr 16 21:21:43 2011] : <b>(102) Renate</b>: <font color='#000080'>With a little reluctance, Renate dismounts. "I'll need someone to spot for me, the way up to the villa. Emily, do you mind?"</font><br />
[Sat Apr 16 21:21:46 2011] : <b>(103) Alan</b>: <font color='#612769'>Meanwhile, in the villa, while Adam and Rialto are in the middle of some abstruse discussion of planar physics, and Zan is flipping through all Adam's books looking for something that isn't astoundingly boring, Aryk reaches out, with a quick decisive gesture, and puts his hand on the doorknob.</font><br />
[Sat Apr 16 21:21:59 2011] : <b>(102) Renate</b>: <font color='#000080'>(goooooooo Aryk!)</font><br />
[Sat Apr 16 21:22:00 2011] : <b>(103) Alan</b>: <font color='#612769'>He can't quite turn it. He takes his hand back off a moment later.</font><br />
[Sat Apr 16 21:22:07 2011] : <b>(103) Alan</b>: <font color='#612769'>But he's close... he can feel it.</font><br />

[Sat Apr 16 21:22:28 2011] : <b>(103) Alan</b>: <font color='#612769'>And then all hell breaks loose!</font><br />

[Sat Apr 16 21:22:38 2011] : <b>(103) Alan</b>: <font color='#612769'>Or all heaven, depending on your perspective.</font><br />
[Sat Apr 16 21:22:59 2011] : <b>(102) Renate</b>: <font color='#000080'>well, I'm hoping frankly that we can kill some of those sumbitches. I don't trust 'em.</font><br />
[Sat Apr 16 21:22:59 2011] : <b>(105) Aryk</b>: <font color='#800000'>Yay.  I touched a doorknob.</font><br />
[Sat Apr 16 21:23:21 2011] : <b>(102) Renate</b>: <font color='#000080'>Well, with any luck that means that Aryk can help toss Zan and Adam out the damn window.</font><br />
[Sat Apr 16 21:23:36 2011] : <b>(102) Renate</b>: <font color='#000080'>Renate won't hint how much she's gonna enjoy giving Adam a bum's rush.</font><br />
[Sat Apr 16 21:24:24 2011] : <b>(104) Rien</b>: <font color='#263607'>Rien probably has a fair idea, though.</font><br />
[Sat Apr 16 21:25:54 2011] : <b>(102) Renate</b>: <font color='#000080'>I expect Ren can manage Rialto by herself... Zan is the slab o' beef here.</font><br />
