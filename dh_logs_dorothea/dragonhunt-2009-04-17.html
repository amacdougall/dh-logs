[Fri Apr 17 22:05:58 2009] : <b>(25228) Alan</b>: <font color='#000080'>Gen is a character. In Street Fighter. He knows kung fu and has cancer!</font><br />
[Fri Apr 17 22:06:07 2009] : <b>(25229) Aryk</b>: <font color='#710000'>He wanted to fight last night and I had to turn in.</font><br />
[Fri Apr 17 22:06:14 2009] : <b>(25228) Alan</b>: <font color='#000080'>His cancer is not part of his fighting techniques.</font><br />
[Fri Apr 17 22:06:22 2009] : <b>(25229) Aryk</b>: <font color='#710000'>But it should be.</font><br />
[Fri Apr 17 22:06:36 2009] : <b>(25228) Alan</b>: <font color='#000080'>It might be tuberculosis, I'm not sure. There are vaccines for that, but he's super old, so maybe he just never got it.</font><br />
[Fri Apr 17 22:06:36 2009] : <b>(25223) Rien</b>: <font color='#003300'>Cough up a lung and hit the other guy with it?</font><br />

[Fri Apr 17 22:09:18 2009] : <b>(25229) Aryk</b>: <font color='#710000'>Okay.  I must have spelled the Chinese version.</font><br />
[Fri Apr 17 22:09:39 2009] : <b>(25228) Alan</b>: <font color='#000080'>Back in juuuust a second. And then Aryk is on deck! Actually huh. Aryk will have Sabra around, and could also have Randall if Adrian wants to drive someone.</font><br />
[Fri Apr 17 22:10:02 2009] : <b>(25223) Rien</b>: <font color='#003300'>Okay, I've missed a session, so I have no idea what's going on.</font><br />
[Fri Apr 17 22:10:02 2009] : <b>(25228) Alan</b>: <font color='#000080'>Rien is on his own, I think? But could have someone along if you want to participate. Separate from Renate though unfortunately.</font><br />
[Fri Apr 17 22:10:28 2009] : <b>(25228) Alan</b>: <font color='#000080'>Similar with Renate, she's going to get a visit from Emil as a matter of fact.</font><br />
[Fri Apr 17 22:10:47 2009] : <b>(25228) Alan</b>: <font color='#000080'>The idea is that each of the three of you get let in on Secret Knowledges which, taken in the round, add up to what you'll learn in Chapter 15.</font><br />
[Fri Apr 17 22:10:59 2009] : <b>(25228) Alan</b>: <font color='#000080'>i.e. Chapter 15 is a "dramatization" of the synthesis of what the three of you learn.</font><br />
[Fri Apr 17 22:11:13 2009] : <b>(25223) Rien</b>: <font color='#003300'>Uh huh... did I miss a session somewhere?</font><br />
[Fri Apr 17 22:11:48 2009] : <b>(25223) Rien</b>: <font color='#003300'>The last I remember Rien was talking with the Sage</font><br />
[Fri Apr 17 22:11:48 2009] : <b>(25228) Alan</b>: <font color='#000080'>Anyway, what order do you want to be in?</font><br />
[Fri Apr 17 22:12:22 2009] : <b>(25228) Alan</b>: <font color='#000080'>Well, we missed a couple of sessions due to ... things. Rien was going to Eldorado to follow up on the Sage's suggestions.</font><br />
[Fri Apr 17 22:12:44 2009] : <b>(25223) Rien</b>: <font color='#003300'>There seems to have been a lot happening for sessions that never happened, then.</font><br />
[Fri Apr 17 22:13:01 2009] : <b>(25229) Aryk</b>: <font color='#710000'>Aryk escaped his Hell dimension with churchie participation.</font><br />
[Fri Apr 17 22:13:04 2009] : <b>(25228) Alan</b>: <font color='#000080'>Well, am I going crazy here? Wasn't Rien's plan to go to Eldorado next, to the Sealed Library?</font><br />
[Fri Apr 17 22:13:05 2009] : <b>(25230) Sabra</b>: <font color='#000080'>Aryk's on deck.</font><br />
[Fri Apr 17 22:13:09 2009] : <b>(25228) Alan</b>: <font color='#000080'>Right, that's where Aryk's at.</font><br />
[Fri Apr 17 22:13:27 2009] : <b>(25223) Rien</b>: <font color='#003300'>When dd all this happen?</font><br />
[Fri Apr 17 22:13:34 2009] : <b>(25223) Rien</b>: <font color='#003300'>did*</font><br />
[Fri Apr 17 22:13:49 2009] : <b>(25228) Alan</b>: <font color='#000080'>It hasn't happened! Rien was just planning to, as a result of his conversation with the Sage. I am pretty sure this is what you said.</font><br />
[Fri Apr 17 22:14:05 2009] : <b>(25228) Alan</b>: <font color='#000080'>The Sage was all "go learn about the end of the Dragon War" and Rien was all "I'm sleepy good night"</font><br />

[Fri Apr 17 22:14:16 2009] : <b>(25228) Alan</b>: <font color='#000080'>Oh. Yes, you might have missed that session.</font><br />
[Fri Apr 17 22:14:19 2009] : <b>(25229) Aryk</b>: <font color='#710000'>When you turned in early.</font><br />
[Fri Apr 17 22:15:34 2009] : <b>(25228) Alan</b>: <font color='#000080'>Anyway. Adrian, I am putting you in charge of Randall. The (sole?) moderating influence on Sabra, he's levelheaded to the point of nerdiness, and insists on solid methodology to back up her intuitive leaps and fell swoops.</font><br />
[Fri Apr 17 22:15:56 2009] : <b>(25223) Rien</b>: <font color='#003300'>Okay</font><br />
[Fri Apr 17 22:16:05 2009] : <b>(25229) Aryk</b>: <font color='#710000'>Beverage.  BRB.  Go ahead and set it up.</font><br />
[Fri Apr 17 22:16:23 2009] : <b>(25228) Alan</b>: <font color='#000080'>He has pretty traditional Raphelite prayers. Quite strong stuff, too. Noncombat, he uses one of those standard thin white staves.</font><br />

[Fri Apr 17 22:16:52 2009] : <b>(25228) Alan</b>: <font color='#000080'>Various healing lights and songs.</font><br />
[Fri Apr 17 22:17:12 2009] : <b>(25228) Alan</b>: <font color='#000080'>Actual light, of course. Buffs good, debuffs evil.</font><br />
[Fri Apr 17 22:17:53 2009] : <b>(25228) Alan</b>: <font color='#000080'>He can also just knock undead out with life energy, by casting resurrection spells right at them.</font><br />
[Fri Apr 17 22:18:17 2009] : <b>(25228) Alan</b>: <font color='#000080'>Or just do area-effect heals that constantly restore his friends while harming undead.</font><br />
[Fri Apr 17 22:18:57 2009] : <b>(25223) Rien</b>: <font color='#003300'>okay</font><br />
[Fri Apr 17 22:19:03 2009] : <b>(25228) Alan</b>: <font color='#000080'>Against living opponents, he can't directly attack them, but he can be a crushing supporting spellcaster by preventing them from healing -- Raphael can choose who is worthy of life, and put an anti-healing debuff of people.</font><br />
[Fri Apr 17 22:19:11 2009] : <b>(25228) Alan</b>: <font color='#000080'>It sucks when you try to use a potion and it goes down like water.</font><br />
[Fri Apr 17 22:19:41 2009] : <b>(25228) Alan</b>: <font color='#000080'>Does he have a moral right to do this? Excellent question. It ties directly into the theological problems in the Church of Raphael.</font><br />

[Fri Apr 17 22:46:51 2009] : <b>(25228) Alan</b>: <font color='#000080'>Now and then the corridor broadens into a gallery, with poorly-executed busts in a style which is, to Randall, hauntingly familiar.

[Fri Apr 17 22:47:07 2009] : <b>(25228) Alan</b>: <font color='#000080'>Some in combat, more through persecution.</font><br />
[Fri Apr 17 22:47:57 2009] : <b>(25228) Alan</b>: <font color='#000080'>Randall realizes, before long, that these are icons of the early Human Church, which was formed after the Dragon War; it was oppressed by the remnants -- human as well -- of the Elven Church.</font><br />

[Fri Apr 17 22:50:01 2009] : <b>(25228) Alan</b>: <font color='#000080'>The Church prefers to gloss over it by simply saying that there was a "disorganized" period after which humans and angels formed a new covenant.</font><br />
