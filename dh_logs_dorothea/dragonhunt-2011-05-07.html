[Sat May  7 08:26:22 2011] : <b>(52) Alan</b>: <font color='#612769'>Okay, if he has time, the Grovekeeper can "stretch" Birch Creek (the pocket dimension) so that a distant part of it overlaps the nexus to Niaj's realm.

[Sat May  7 08:27:47 2011] : <b>(50) Renate</b>: <font color='#000080'>"Will we have to bring one of their altars here?"</font><br />
[Sat May  7 08:28:03 2011] : <b>(52) Alan</b>: <font color='#612769'>If he fits them precisely to existing doorways -- or planar portals -- he can essentially make a shortcut, so that Niaj's realm appears directly connected to the entrance point in Herrendon Deep.</font><br />
[Sat May  7 08:28:37 2011] : <b>(52) Alan</b>: <font color='#612769'>The Grovekeeper ponders this question, trunk creaking as his "head" looks skyward in contemplation.</font><br />

Priests who use a lot of divine magic have a need to know. Paladins don't. They keep it semi-secret because, well, it would be at least a little bit of a test of faith, or maybe a temptation, if you knew.

"Yeah, if the heretics lead enough people astray, their collective belief divides the divine patron against himself.

[Sat May  7 10:22:53 2011] : <b>(52) Alan</b>: <font color='#612769'>"That's one way of looking at it," Adam says with a shrug.</font><br />
[Sat May  7 10:23:41 2011] : <b>(50) Renate</b>: <font color='#000080'>"Another way, since I am not bound by any oaths," says Renate, "is that the divine patron does not necessarily know which direction is best, and trusts his worshippers to decide. As with Artagus."</font><br />
[Sat May  7 10:23:51 2011] : <b>(52) Alan</b>: <font color='#612769'>"Anyway, the reason I could use Raphael's power for evil, at least for a little while, is that Raphael doesn't answer each prayer individually. Instead, he grants me a pool of divine power which I can draw on."</font><br />
[Sat May  7 10:24:32 2011] : <b>(52) Alan</b>: <font color='#612769'>"If I exhaust the pool, I can't use any more prayers until it is replenished. Some patrons give their priests a steady trickle of power. Others make them pray at an altar. It all depends."</font><br />

[Sat May  7 10:26:38 2011] : <b>(52) Alan</b>: <font color='#612769'>"It has to run out some day," Adam says. "Without a divine patron receiving power from worship, the pool can't refill."</font><br />
[Sat May  7 10:27:42 2011] : <b>(50) Renate</b>: <font color='#000080'>"But if I understand you correctly, use of that pool is not guided. Power utterly without wisdom."</font><br />

When these knights come, we won't fight them.  In fact we're not going to give them any reason to do to us what they did to Brosford, and they probably did to Payton, and who knows what else.
