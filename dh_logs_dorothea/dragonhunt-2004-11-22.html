[Mon Nov 22 20:41:58 2004] : <B>Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>Oh, no. Just things she can do that I don't know about.</font><br>
[Mon Nov 22 20:42:03 2004] : <B>Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>People who suddenly drop their ditz act to reveal a cool efficiency are, how you say, utterly overdone?</font><br>
[Mon Nov 22 20:42:04 2004] : <B>Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>And a backstory.</font><br>
[Mon Nov 22 20:42:15 2004] : <B>Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>Right. She has those.</font><br>
[Mon Nov 22 20:42:22 2004] : <B>Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>Heh. Incompetence definitely genuine. :)</font><br>
[Mon Nov 22 20:42:45 2004] : <B>Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>And self-esteem to match, poor thing.</font><br>
[Mon Nov 22 20:42:56 2004] : <B>Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>Oh, I don't know about that -- every now and then, she makes good on an opportunity.</font><br>
[Mon Nov 22 20:43:27 2004] : <B>Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>In fact, you could make an argument that she's the type of person who doesn't mind lowering the expectations of those around her...</font><br>
[Mon Nov 22 20:43:38 2004] : <B>Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>...if it means she gets more notice when she comes through.</font><br>
[Mon Nov 22 20:43:59 2004] : <B>Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>Whether that argument would be correct is something you'll eventually find out.</font><br>
[Mon Nov 22 20:44:22 2004] : <B>Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>Heh.</font><br>
[Mon Nov 22 20:45:05 2004] : <B>Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>A better explanation might be that she's just bad under pressure. I mean, she's running a complex light show for one of the biggest names in music.</font><br>
[Mon Nov 22 20:45:23 2004] : <B>Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>At least, that explanation fits observed facts better.</font><br>
[Mon Nov 22 20:45:29 2004] : <B>Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>Indeed.</font><br>
[Mon Nov 22 20:46:25 2004] : <B>Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>Well, I believe when we left Renate had just been given a hot tip on where to find Aaron.</font><br>
[Mon Nov 22 20:47:49 2004] : <B>Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>Something like that; lemme review my log.</font><br>
[Mon Nov 22 20:48:01 2004] : <B>Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>I'll probably be a bit slow tonight.</font><br>
[Mon Nov 22 20:49:05 2004] : <B>Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>That should be all right. She gets to bitch Aaron out, and if I'm lucky, put an extremely dangerous and exciting plan into operation. You just get to react, for once. :)</font><br>
[Mon Nov 22 20:51:26 2004] : <B>Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>Okay, log is on. You just got done talking to Abram Mayonet, who is searching for his cousin; and before that, Captain Nagle (Ilium Irregulars, retired) suggested you drop by a certain herbwife's cottage during the duels.</font><br>
[Mon Nov 22 20:51:55 2004] : <B>Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>Why wait? As soon as she can, Renate ducks out of the milling crowd and asks a local for directions to Goody Whemper's.</font><br>
[Mon Nov 22 20:52:17 2004] : <B>Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>If she can find Aaron by himself, so much the better -- she shouldn't yell at him in front of his ex-crewmates.</font><br>
[Mon Nov 22 20:52:39 2004] : <B>Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>However much he deserves to be yelled at.</font><br>
[Mon Nov 22 20:52:57 2004] : <B>Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>The cottage is at the end of a narrow but weedless stone path, in a corner of the village where it abuts a copse.</font><br>
[Mon Nov 22 20:53:12 2004] : <B>Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>A fair enough place to slip into town from the less-watched woods.</font><br>
[Mon Nov 22 20:53:32 2004] : <B>Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>Any horses tethered nearby? Aaron's is a foul-tempered old sorrel.</font><br>
[Mon Nov 22 20:53:36 2004] : <B>Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>A bellpull hangs by the door.</font><br>
[Mon Nov 22 20:53:58 2004] : <B>Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>Renate knows that horse; it's bitten her often and often.</font><br>
[Mon Nov 22 20:54:02 2004] : <B>Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>No horses at all; only a placid old goat chewing on some grass.</font><br>
[Mon Nov 22 20:54:39 2004] : <B>Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>Well, then. No help for it. Renate takes a careful look around (take 10 on a Spot check), and if nothing obvious intrudes on her notice, walks calmly up and pulls on the bell.</font><br>
[Mon Nov 22 20:55:30 2004] : <B>Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>A cursory look-and-listen brings sounds of light cooking; someone's home, that's all you can tell.</font><br>
[Mon Nov 22 20:55:43 2004] : <B>Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>Fine. The bell sounds inside.</font><br>
[Mon Nov 22 20:56:45 2004] : <B>Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>After a moment, the door opens, and an upright old lady greets you diffidently. "Hello, mistress."</font><br>
[Mon Nov 22 20:56:55 2004] : <B>Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>"Good morning."</font><br>
[Mon Nov 22 20:57:29 2004] : <B>Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>She wears widow's black; her wispy white hair is pulled back in a bun.</font><br>
[Mon Nov 22 20:57:50 2004] : <B>Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>"I'm Goodwife Whemper. Is there something I can do for you?"</font><br>
[Mon Nov 22 20:58:16 2004] : <B>Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>Her tone is guarded; a town like Glenworth isn't used to strangers any more than Karlbotel is.</font><br>
[Mon Nov 22 20:58:26 2004] : <B>Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>"I am sent by Captain Nagle to ask after a guest of yours. May I come in, please?"</font><br>
[Mon Nov 22 20:58:34 2004] : <B>Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>And the wandering sluggers come for the tournament have likely put the townsfolk on edge.</font><br>
[Mon Nov 22 20:58:46 2004] : <B>Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>(boy, if I were townsfolk I'd be on edge!)</font><br>
[Mon Nov 22 20:59:32 2004] : <B>Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>"Well, if the Captain vouches for you, I suppose so..." she gestures you inside. The place is spare; just a main room which combines kitchen, living room, and dining area, and a door that presumably leads to a bedchamber.</font><br>
[Mon Nov 22 20:59:50 2004] : <B>Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>"Thank you, Mistress. I am in your debt."</font><br>
[Mon Nov 22 21:00:00 2004] : <B>Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>A pleasant-smelling herbal concoction simmers on the pot-bellied stove.</font><br>
[Mon Nov 22 21:00:46 2004] : <B>Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>(Not that the mental image is important, but we're talking about the ones with the range on top, not the Franklin type with the stovepipe on top.)</font><br>
[Mon Nov 22 21:00:50 2004] : <B>Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>(heh)</font><br>
[Mon Nov 22 21:01:00 2004] : <B>Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>"May I ask if your guest is in at present?"</font><br>
[Mon Nov 22 21:02:07 2004] : <B>Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>"No, he is not. His lordship already went to the grounds to take a look at his competition."</font><br>
[Mon Nov 22 21:02:31 2004] : <B>Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>Renate blinks. "I'm sorry, <i>his Lordship</i>? Perhaps we do not speak of the same person."</font><br>
[Mon Nov 22 21:02:56 2004] : <B>Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>"I only speak of Sir Lundig. I thought you knew him."</font><br>
[Mon Nov 22 21:03:14 2004] : <B>Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>In fact, you do&#8212;he's the closest thing Karlbotel has to a champion chevalier.</font><br>
[Mon Nov 22 21:03:27 2004] : <B>Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>Which is to say, not very close at all, but at least he has a warhorse and a lance.</font><br>
[Mon Nov 22 21:03:32 2004] : <B>Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>Renate sighs. "You have no other guest but he?"</font><br>
[Mon Nov 22 21:04:02 2004] : <B>Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>He drills the militia in riding and conversely in anti-cavalry tactics.</font><br>
[Mon Nov 22 21:05:00 2004] : <B>Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>"Well, he has a squire, of course, who sleeps in the woodshed."</font><br>
[Mon Nov 22 21:05:03 2004] : <B>Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>"It is a man older than he I seek, not so tall but stronger-built, greying rather."</font><br>
[Mon Nov 22 21:05:32 2004] : <B>Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>Damn it. She had described Aaron to Captain Nagle. He couldn't have misunderstood her. What <i>is</i> this madness, and where is Aaron?</font><br>
[Mon Nov 22 21:05:38 2004] : <B>Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>You've met Sir Lundig's squire before; a good-natured man who is barely intelligent enough for the tasks of carrying and maintaining his master's equipment.</font><br>
[Mon Nov 22 21:06:00 2004] : <B>Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>"Ah, then it's Sir Lundig's squire you're after, no doubt about it."</font><br>
[Mon Nov 22 21:06:10 2004] : <B>Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>"Aha. Where might I find him?"</font><br>
[Mon Nov 22 21:06:35 2004] : <B>Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>"Oh, I'm certain he'd be with Sir Lundig, or else running his errands."</font><br>
[Mon Nov 22 21:06:43 2004] : <B>Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>"I haven't seen him today."</font><br>
[Mon Nov 22 21:07:05 2004] : <B>Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>"I rather think not," Renate muses. "Would it be an imposition, Mistress Whemper, if I had a look in your woodshed?"</font><br>
[Mon Nov 22 21:07:49 2004] : <B>Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>"Why, no, go right ahead. But I must say I don't think he'd be so lazy as to lie about sleeping at this late hour."</font><br>
[Mon Nov 22 21:08:26 2004] : <B>Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>"Thank you, ma'am. I won't trouble you further." Renate performs a country curtsey and leaves the way she came, circling around the back to look for the woodshed.</font><br>
[Mon Nov 22 21:08:42 2004] : <B>Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>Aaron can't be moseying around seeing sights; too much chance of running into the Rolling Jinx.</font><br>
[Mon Nov 22 21:09:22 2004] : <B>Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>After a brief adventure in which the goat takes an interest in eating your bootlace, you take a look in the woodshed, and although you don't find Aaron, you do find his travelling bag.</font><br>
[Mon Nov 22 21:09:35 2004] : <B>Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>His weapons aren't among the belongings he left behind, though.</font><br>
[Mon Nov 22 21:09:46 2004] : <B>Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>Figures. She rifles it; anything of interest?</font><br>
[Mon Nov 22 21:10:10 2004] : <B>Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>Just clothing and assorted travelling supplies. Anything useful in a fight is absent.</font><br>
[Mon Nov 22 21:10:17 2004] : <B>Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>Pen and paper?</font><br>
[Mon Nov 22 21:10:43 2004] : <B>Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>Of course; his journal is there, too, but it's ironbound and padlocked.</font><br>
[Mon Nov 22 21:11:15 2004] : <B>Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>He has said that he considers many of its contents dangeorus.</font><br>
[Mon Nov 22 21:11:47 2004] : <B>Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>She doesn't need the journal. She tears a piece in two, writes something on one half which she folds and puts into her own pocket. On the other half, she writes in a large bold hand, "GO HOME! RAVA" and leaves it in his bag.</font><br>
[Mon Nov 22 21:12:26 2004] : <B>Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>"Fine," she snarls at nothing in particular. "We settle this my way. It ends, here and now."</font><br>
[Mon Nov 22 21:12:53 2004] : <B>Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>And she leaves the woodshed and makes haste back to the fighting-ground, where she looks for the herald in charge of the individual challenges.</font><br>
[Mon Nov 22 21:13:15 2004] : <B>Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>(Though if Lundig or Aaron meets her eye, that'll do too!)</font><br>
[Mon Nov 22 21:13:44 2004] : <B>Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>You happen to spot Sir Lundig nearby; he's waving his archaic two-handed sword around in manly circles.</font><br>
[Mon Nov 22 21:14:05 2004] : <B>Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>She approaches and waits for him to deign to notice her.</font><br>
[Mon Nov 22 21:14:17 2004] : <B>Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>He's a military history buff among other things; you know, from him, that the sword was designed to fight against mounted or unmounted men.</font><br>
[Mon Nov 22 21:14:32 2004] : <B>Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>He hasn't seen her in a while; she hopes the time lapse is enough to augment her thin disguise.</font><br>
[Mon Nov 22 21:14:47 2004] : <B>Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>If he is stupid enough to call out her <i>name</i>, she is done for.</font><br>
[Mon Nov 22 21:15:33 2004] : <B>Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>The moment he sees you, he does a double take, then goes back to his exercises for a moment before walking around the back of a stable that borders the field.</font><br>
[Mon Nov 22 21:15:44 2004] : <B>Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>She follows at a discreet distance.</font><br>
[Mon Nov 22 21:16:44 2004] : <B>Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>He casts a few glances over his shoulder, seemingly unsure whether to try to shake you; finally, he stops behind a convenient wall of barrels and looks at you quizzically.</font><br>
[Mon Nov 22 21:17:19 2004] : <B>Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>"How long have you had your squire, Sir Lundig?" she asks without preamble. "I am of a mind to hire him away from you."</font><br>
[Mon Nov 22 21:17:37 2004] : <B>Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>"Of course, he is something of a disloyal fellow, so I presume I may have him cheaply."</font><br>
[Mon Nov 22 21:17:59 2004] : <B>Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>"You'd be welcome to him, but he should be well on his way home by now."</font><br>

[Mon Nov 22 21:19:08 2004] : <B>Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>"He came with us to examine the foe and suggest strategies. This is well achieved, and now, to my knowledge, he has gone."</font><br>
[Mon Nov 22 21:19:47 2004] : <B>Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>"We're meeting at a certain place during the duels to study the notes he left behind there."</font><br>
[Mon Nov 22 21:20:25 2004] : <B>Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>"Why do you question his loyalty? His actions seem consistent with the position of drillmaster and mentor."</font><br>
[Mon Nov 22 21:20:54 2004] : <B>Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>"He hasn't gone," Renate declares with absolute certainty. "He should have, but he hasn't. Put the word out. Anyone who sees him needs to collar him and bring him to me."</font><br>
[Mon Nov 22 21:21:11 2004] : <B>Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>"Loyalty? Is it loyalty to lie to one's liege about a journey into enemy lands?"</font><br>
[Mon Nov 22 21:21:12 2004] : <B>Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>"What? What possible motive could he have to stay? Surely he realizes the dangers!"</font><br>
[Mon Nov 22 21:21:50 2004] : <B>Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>"...lie? There is clearly much I am not privy to, and if you will pardon me, I do not wish to be."</font><br>
[Mon Nov 22 21:22:28 2004] : <B>Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>She nods. "Fair enough. You were used, Sir Lundig; you had best watch yourself with that old badger in future. Good day to you, sir, and I thank you for your honesty."</font><br>
[Mon Nov 22 21:23:00 2004] : <B>Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>"Should I remain in this tourney? Will my arms still serve Karlbotel if I do?"</font><br>
[Mon Nov 22 21:23:13 2004] : <B>Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>Sir Lundig has always been a person who prefers to keep the world clear-cut.</font><br>
[Mon Nov 22 21:23:49 2004] : <B>Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>She turns back and smiles, relenting. "Of course. Though if I am granted good fortune, you will not take up arms this day at all. Pray excuse me; I am in haste."</font><br>
[Mon Nov 22 21:24:15 2004] : <B>Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>"I would fain teach these Glenworth curs the might of Karlbotel blades... ah, sorry. Good fortune to you."</font><br>
[Mon Nov 22 21:25:09 2004] : <B>Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>Renate turns toward the fighting-grounds again, her purpose redoubled. <i>Lady Lyria</i>, she prays under her breath, <i>if ever you loved peace, be my friend today, and watch over me.</i></font><br>
[Mon Nov 22 21:26:07 2004] : <B>Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>When she finds someone with the harried air of a functionary, she stops him smoothly with a hand on his elbow. "Is it too late to issue a challenge?" she asks, her Lan'yarian accent back in place.</font><br>
[Mon Nov 22 21:27:13 2004] : <B>Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>"Issue a challenge? Why, certainly you may issue one, but the opponent may discreetly decline."</font><br>
[Mon Nov 22 21:28:07 2004] : <B>Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>"The best way to issue a challenge is to find the opposite party and do so personally and in public. This paperwork is simply a formality."</font><br>
[Mon Nov 22 21:28:38 2004] : <B>Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>"I shall do so, then; may I have the appropriate papers?"</font><br>
[Mon Nov 22 21:28:54 2004] : <B>Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>(Heh. I thought she'd have to send him a note. Cool. This is better.)</font><br>
[Mon Nov 22 21:29:26 2004] : <B>Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>"Ah, hold on, let me get them..." he hurries over to an open-air desk and grabs one up. "Here, a registration paper for a formal duel to the death. I'll sign this ahead of time; the signatures of the combatants make it personal."</font><br>
[Mon Nov 22 21:30:07 2004] : <B>Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>When he hands you the form, for a moment the headline seems to read, <i>Don't Love Peace, Necessarily, Just You.</i></font><br>
[Mon Nov 22 21:30:27 2004] : <B>Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>After a quick blink, it says, <i>Proclamation of Challenge</i>.</font><br>
[Mon Nov 22 21:31:00 2004] : <B>Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>Renate shakes her head and accepts the paper, reading it over quickly to be assured that her challenge cannot be fobbed off on a proxy.</font><br>
[Mon Nov 22 21:32:00 2004] : <B>Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>The contract isn't that complex; it has the obvious spirit-over-letter bias of frontier law.</font><br>
[Mon Nov 22 21:32:24 2004] : <B>Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>Oh, that's fine. That's the only detail that's important to her just at present.</font><br>
[Mon Nov 22 21:32:52 2004] : <B>Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>No reasonable reading could interpret it as anything but "these two people, specifically, will fight to the death using hand-to-hand weapons or their bare hands."</font><br>

[Mon Nov 22 21:33:27 2004] : <B>Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>Oh, I'm guessing.</font><br>
[Mon Nov 22 21:33:52 2004] : <B>Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>... the grounds of Glenworth Manor.</font><br>
[Mon Nov 22 21:34:03 2004] : <B>Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>"Ending the feud" would mean killing Stephen of Glenworth right off the bat.</font><br>
[Mon Nov 22 21:34:06 2004] : <B>Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>Ah, there you go.</font><br>
[Mon Nov 22 21:34:43 2004] : <B>Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>(Heh. You <i>don't</i> know where I'm going with this.)</font><br>
[Mon Nov 22 21:34:47 2004] : <B>Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>(Cool.)</font><br>
[Mon Nov 22 21:34:51 2004] : <B>Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>Then I'll find out.</font><br>
[Mon Nov 22 21:34:55 2004] : <B>Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>(I don't often sneak one past you...)</font><br>
[Mon Nov 22 21:35:01 2004] : <B>Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>So where's our target?</font><br>
[Mon Nov 22 21:35:23 2004] : <B>Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>Well, just challenging and killing the guy doesn't sound like Renate's style at all, so I didn't think that was necessarily it. But I confess I can't guess what she's up to.</font><br>

[Mon Nov 22 21:36:05 2004] : <B>Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>Guards cross pikes before you. "State your name and business."</font><br>
[Mon Nov 22 21:36:35 2004] : <B>Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>"Lady Renate von Adler of Karlbotel," she proclaims proudly, "here with a challenge for Stephen of Glenworth."</font><br>
[Mon Nov 22 21:37:02 2004] : <B>Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>One guard looks at the other one. "Were you expecting that, Brun?"</font><br>
[Mon Nov 22 21:37:07 2004] : <B>Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>"No. No, I honestly was not."</font><br>
[Mon Nov 22 21:37:39 2004] : <B>Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>"How about, I, just, um, I'll be right back with... something," the first guard says. "Brun, keep an eye on her."</font><br>
[Mon Nov 22 21:37:57 2004] : <B>Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>"I will wait," she says obligingly.</font><br>
[Mon Nov 22 21:38:00 2004] : <B>Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>Brun shrugs. "Right. If she tries to steal the silverware, I'll collar her in a flash."</font><br>
[Mon Nov 22 21:38:29 2004] : <B>Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>"Shut up, this is weirding me out, okay? Just be impassive or whatever you do." The first guard hustles off into the manor.</font><br>
[Mon Nov 22 21:38:56 2004] : <B>Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>"Sorry," she murmurs, momentarily coldly amused.</font><br>
[Mon Nov 22 21:39:39 2004] : <B>Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>He comes back out in a moment with someone considerably more official-looking; a dignified old man with the fringed robes of the Silver Coast diplomatic corps.</font><br>
[Mon Nov 22 21:40:36 2004] : <B>Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>This must be Gadon Chambourne, Glenworth's "prime minister," to the extent that such a small area needs one.</font><br>

[Mon Nov 22 21:41:00 2004] : <B>Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>Your father has often spoken of his alternately as the only honorable man in a den of thieves, and the only competent thief in a den of fools.</font><br>
[Mon Nov 22 21:41:23 2004] : <B>Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>To the extent that Glenworth is any conventional threat, it's because of Chambourne.</font><br>

[Mon Nov 22 21:42:01 2004] : <B>Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>He seems aghast to see you.</font><br>
[Mon Nov 22 21:42:02 2004] : <B>Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>"I must do nothing of the kind, Master Chambourne."</font><br>
[Mon Nov 22 21:42:19 2004] : <B>Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>"I am here, as has no doubt been told you, with a challenge for the Baron."</font><br>

[Mon Nov 22 21:43:23 2004] : <B>Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>Chambourne claps his hand to his forehead. "I hoped it was a... I don't know what I hoped. Are you really here to just fight him and have done with it?"</font><br>
[Mon Nov 22 21:43:33 2004] : <B>Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>"Because I don't know that I can allow that. He is my... responsibility."</font><br>
[Mon Nov 22 21:44:55 2004] : <B>Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>"I am here to have done with it, yes." She takes off her sunglasses and looks the old man in the eye; her face is sad, rather than angry, and determined. "You need to trust me, Master Chambourne. I am my father's daughter, but I am also Ilium's guardian. You need to trust me; I swear to you, you will not regret it."</font><br>
[Mon Nov 22 21:46:05 2004] : <B>Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>Chambourne shakes his head as if to clear it. "Our motives are unlikely to be the same. I am sworn to do what is best for Stephen; and <i>not</i> in some sense of tragic resolution."</font><br>
[Mon Nov 22 21:46:29 2004] : <B>Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>"Then it is best to leave him to his madness?"</font><br>
[Mon Nov 22 21:46:51 2004] : <B>Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>"It is best to struggle, day by day, to teach him."</font><br>
[Mon Nov 22 21:47:04 2004] : <B>Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>"Let me help, then. Please."</font><br>
[Mon Nov 22 21:47:33 2004] : <B>Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>"Help? Then you propose something more constructive than bloodshed? A funny way to do it."</font><br>

[Mon Nov 22 21:48:38 2004] : <B>Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>"There is more to this than I can tell you. I see no other way forward. Come, it is hope I offer you; will you not take it? Am I so unworthy of a good man's trust?"</font><br>
[Mon Nov 22 21:52:32 2004] : <B>Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>The prime minister looks to the heavens for inspiration. Finally: "I have heard much news of you. You are generous to a fault; but you can kill those you consider evil or irredeemable without hesitation."</font><br>
[Mon Nov 22 21:52:50 2004] : <B>Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>"But I cannot imagine you capable of premeditated murder."</font><br>
[Mon Nov 22 21:53:07 2004] : <B>Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>"Bold though Stephen is, you must realize that a fair duel would be such a murder."</font><br>

[Mon Nov 22 21:53:29 2004] : <B>Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>"With that understanding... I shall deliver your challenge. I am certain he will accept."</font><br>
[Mon Nov 22 21:54:04 2004] : <B>Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>"I expect he will. Thank you, Master Chambourne. I am honoured to have met you." She hands over the challenge without delay.</font><br>
[Mon Nov 22 21:55:04 2004] : <B>Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>"Are you aware that Aaron Wrenfall is in the town? Our esteemed guests reported this to me, with the suggestion that if he were to depart immediately, much awkwardness could be avoided."</font><br>
[Mon Nov 22 21:55:42 2004] : <B>Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>"I am aware. I agree with the suggestion; I am simply not at all sanguine that it can be carried out."</font><br>
[Mon Nov 22 21:56:09 2004] : <B>Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>"If the Baron will meet me first of all, perhaps the awkwardness will have no opportunity to occur."</font><br>
[Mon Nov 22 21:56:16 2004] : <B>Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>"Then he is beyond your control. It relieves me to know that you know some of my pain."</font><br>
[Mon Nov 22 21:57:06 2004] : <B>Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>She takes his shoulders in her strong young hands. "Don't worry. This is for the best. For the Baron, for his people -- for mine, for <i>ours</i>."</font><br>
[Mon Nov 22 21:58:06 2004] : <B>Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>"Ours? A delightful coda to a thrilling conversation," Chambourne says, milking the maximum ironic misinterpretation out of your statement.</font><br>
[Mon Nov 22 21:58:27 2004] : <B>Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>"I shall arrange matters. By all means, take your ease in the town."</font><br>
[Mon Nov 22 21:58:52 2004] : <B>Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>"Thank you, sir; I shall. Good day, then."</font><br>
[Mon Nov 22 22:00:15 2004] : <B>Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>Relieved, serene, she glides away. Her course is set; nothing can move it. Now she only has to wait. She starts adjusting the buckles of her arms and armor as she goes.</font><br>
[Mon Nov 22 22:01:36 2004] : <B>Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>Are you dropping the disguise?</font><br>
[Mon Nov 22 22:01:43 2004] : <B>Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>Nobody here would necessarily recognize you anyway.</font><br>
[Mon Nov 22 22:02:22 2004] : <B>Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>Eh, no, leave it on. No point in getting accosted before the official scrum.</font><br>
[Mon Nov 22 22:02:29 2004] : <B>Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>Word will pass anyway; those guards seemed gossipy.</font><br>
[Mon Nov 22 22:02:56 2004] : <B>Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>Within a half-hour, the town is abuzz with the news that the heir to Karlbotel will be facing off with the ruler of Glenworth on the field of honor.</font><br>
[Mon Nov 22 22:03:09 2004] : <B>Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>(brb, phone from girl)</font><br>
[Mon Nov 22 22:03:24 2004] : <B>Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>Renate rolls her eyes. She is <i>not</i> the heir; Baron Rainer has not named his heir.</font><br>
[Mon Nov 22 22:03:43 2004] : <B>Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>This is not, however, the time to discuss the fine points of Karlbotel succession. Especially not with the Rolling Jinx in town.</font><br>
[Mon Nov 22 22:07:38 2004] : <B>Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>Renate finds an out-of-the-way place to wait, this not being a good time to run into Coris or Lundig either.</font><br>

[Mon Nov 22 22:13:10 2004] : <B>Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>(She had a bad day.)</font><br>
[Mon Nov 22 22:13:24 2004] : <B>Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>(I'm sorry. Hope tomorrow is better.)</font><br>
[Mon Nov 22 22:14:11 2004] : <B>Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>So, the new tournament schedule is "duel of the century" followed by "feasting and rejoicing and/or moping around confused."</font><br>
[Mon Nov 22 22:14:14 2004] : <B>Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>Depending on who wins.</font><br>
[Mon Nov 22 22:14:25 2004] : <B>Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>(Something like that.)</font><br>
[Mon Nov 22 22:14:41 2004] : <B>Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>(You still seem to have no notion where I'm going, which is curious indeed, as I thought I was being incredibly obvious about it.)</font><br>
[Mon Nov 22 22:15:04 2004] : <B>Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>(I'm probably just off my game.)</font><br>
[Mon Nov 22 22:15:37 2004] : <B>Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>(The only hunches I have are very wild.)</font><br>
[Mon Nov 22 22:15:46 2004] : <B>Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>(Like, if she asks him to marry her, or something.)</font><br>
[Mon Nov 22 22:16:09 2004] : <B>Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>(Well, if she thought it would work...)</font><br>
[Mon Nov 22 22:16:24 2004] : <B>Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>(Probably wouldn't go over too well with him.)</font><br>
[Mon Nov 22 22:16:49 2004] : <B>Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>(Anyway, I'll just find out the hard way.)</font><br>
[Mon Nov 22 22:16:51 2004] : <B>Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>(See, that's the problem.)</font><br>
[Mon Nov 22 22:17:19 2004] : <B>Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>(Ah, was I supposed to be planning for Renate's mysterious action by this point?)</font><br>
[Mon Nov 22 22:17:51 2004] : <B>Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>(Nah. I surprised you; I'm happy; we'll run with it, see where it goes.)</font><br>
[Mon Nov 22 22:18:12 2004] : <B>Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>(I don't know where it's going. It could go somewhere very ugly. I wasn't kidding when I said this was a Hail Mary pass.)</font><br>
[Mon Nov 22 22:18:36 2004] : <B>Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>(Or, shall we say, Hail Lyria.)</font><br>
[Mon Nov 22 22:19:02 2004] : <B>Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>The original plan was that the tourney would start with jesters and mock duels between midgets and so forth, to get the audience cheering, but the stands are packed already: a spectacle like this doesn't happen every day.</font><br>
[Mon Nov 22 22:19:48 2004] : <B>Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>You have to duck around a few times to avoid Coris and his people, who are hunting through the crowds feverishly.</font><br>

[Mon Nov 22 22:22:08 2004] : <B>Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>A herald marches a noble white charger into the center of the field, and reads off a flowering load of rubbish, clearly written hastily and in a deep shade of purple, about the clash of nations and the rule of the strongest.</font><br>

[Mon Nov 22 22:24:52 2004] : <B>Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>He strides into the field dressed in battered but well-maintained plate; either someone convinced him not to wear ceremonial armor, or he has at least a little real experience.</font><br>
[Mon Nov 22 22:24:54 2004] : <B>Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>Renate feels a little frisson. <i>A pity he must be mad,</i> she thinks. <i>He would stand up well with Sabine.</i></font><br>

[Mon Nov 22 22:59:33 2004] : <B>Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>So no more Aaron/Poya showdown (which is ironic, since this interlude was originally meant to highlight that relationship somehow.)</font><br>
[Mon Nov 22 22:59:57 2004] : <B>Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>Shrug. If he wants to go have it out with her in private, that's his lookout; Renate's washed her hands of him.</font><br>
[Mon Nov 22 23:00:09 2004] : <B>Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>It served a good purpose, though, in setting up the Glenworth/Karlbotel feud a little better, and showing that it's largely one-sided. Your actions probably planted some seeds among the populace anyway.</font><br>
[Mon Nov 22 23:00:10 2004] : <B>Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>She figures she just did her duty on his behalf; if he's going to go be a jackass again, that's his problem.</font><br>

[Mon Nov 22 23:00:24 2004] : <B>Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>And on PR.</font><br>
[Mon Nov 22 23:00:33 2004] : <B>Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>It's fine, anyway; there were plot points planned to involve Glenworth, and this just means they'll have more behind them.</font><br>

[Mon Nov 22 23:01:08 2004] : <B>Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>Aw, was I even close?</font><br>
[Mon Nov 22 23:01:33 2004] : <B>Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>Sort of. If you'd gone into a battle of oratory, you could have faced him down with some effort.</font><br>

[Mon Nov 22 23:02:36 2004] : <B>Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>You know what I mean.</font><br>
[Mon Nov 22 23:02:48 2004] : <B>Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>Yes. But that's her style, I'm afraid. Very straightforward.</font><br>
[Mon Nov 22 23:03:13 2004] : <B>Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>And letting actions speak louder than words.</font><br>
[Mon Nov 22 23:03:30 2004] : <B>Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>Ah, see, that part was out of the question. Stephen's not insane in the strictest sense, but the death of his father when he was so young left him emotionally damaged in a way that serves as madness.</font><br>
[Mon Nov 22 23:03:53 2004] : <B>Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>The only way to really "cure" someone like that is with nearly infinite patience; Chambourne's path.</font><br>
[Mon Nov 22 23:04:03 2004] : <B>Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>She thought as much, but she also thought that slaking the bloodlust would be enough. Her mistake.</font><br>

[Mon Nov 22 23:05:11 2004] : <B>Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>Killing a defenseless person in front of his entire town isn't good for him.</font><br>
[Mon Nov 22 23:05:44 2004] : <B>Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>Erm, tying her up wouldn't have been a whole lot better. I suppose Poya realized that.</font><br>
[Mon Nov 22 23:05:51 2004] : <B>Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>(Worse, even, because the undertones are distinctly unsavory.)</font><br>
[Mon Nov 22 23:06:14 2004] : <B>Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>Well, putting her in chains and carting her out of the province would have at least been better.</font><br>
[Mon Nov 22 23:06:18 2004] : <B>Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>And who knows? Poya probably respects you.</font><br>
[Mon Nov 22 23:06:25 2004] : <B>Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>Nah. Then you get the Marie Antoinette syndrome.</font><br>
[Mon Nov 22 23:06:31 2004] : <B>Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>She's not insane or emotionally scarred. Well, not much.</font><br>
