<b>(3) Renate</b>: <font color='#000080'>um, you may have a spyware infestation</font><br />

<b>(1) Alan</b>: <font color='#000000'>Hey, I'm back. Hey, good job suggesting Matt dump his (no doubt incredibly aggravating) PC problems on me.</font><br />
<b>(1) Alan</b>: <font color='#000000'>I suggest never using a computer again. They're nothing but trouble.</font><br />
<b>(2) Rien</b>: <font color='#5e5b33'>Not a lot.  Just trying to arrange my day around the inevitable distrations.  Family are comin' a-visitin' in a couple of hours.</font><br />
<b>(3) Renate</b>: <font color='#000080'>I'm sorry, Alan. I know you're busy.</font><br />
<b>(2) Rien</b>: <font color='#5e5b33'>So once we finish up here I'm going ot lock myself in my room and get my work done and stuff.</font><br />
<b>(1) Alan</b>: <font color='#000000'>Or at least, wipe the hard drives, reinstall only what you need, remove all shortcuts to Internet Explorer ever.</font><br />
<b>(3) Renate</b>: <font color='#000080'>I'd do it myself if I could.</font><br />

<b>(1) Alan</b>: <font color='#000000'>Get Opera (or Firefox if you must, but it's being targeted these days too)</font><br />
<b>(3) Renate</b>: <font color='#000080'>hey, either Buffle is incredibly damn fast or they finally fixed that idiotic scrolling problem.</font><br />
<b>(4) Aryk!</b>: <font color='#a40000'>I'm not one for Opera.</font><br />
<b>(1) Alan</b>: <font color='#000000'>Never open emails of any kind except from people you know.</font><br />
<b>(2) Rien</b>: <font color='#5e5b33'>Which idiotic scrolling problem?</font><br />
<b>(4) Aryk!</b>: <font color='#a40000'>Well, that, obviously.</font><br />
<b>(2) Rien</b>: <font color='#5e5b33'>My work Mac came up with an itiotic scrolling problem after the latest set of updates.</font><br />
<b>(3) Renate</b>: <font color='#000080'>The one where whenever a line is added, OpenRPG would scroll all the way back to the top of the buffer and then back down.</font><br />
<b>(4) Aryk!</b>: <font color='#a40000'>I only use the damn thing pretty much on Fridays, and that's even more than the wiz uses it.</font><br />
<b>(1) Alan</b>: <font color='#000000'>I have no idea how people's computers keep magically slowing down. Then spyware searches don't find much, virus scans don't find much, they're just slow.</font><br />
<b>(3) Renate</b>: <font color='#000080'>Windows. That's why.</font><br />
<b>(1) Alan</b>: <font color='#000000'>It has never happened to me, or anyone I know with computer wisdoms.</font><br />
<b>(1) Alan</b>: <font color='#000000'>Including Windows users.</font><br />
<b>(1) Alan</b>: <font color='#000000'>Yet we can't figure out why it happens to the technically declined.</font><br />
<b>(3) Renate</b>: <font color='#000080'>Bleh, the Silver Surfer was slowing down toward the end of its life.</font><br />
<b>(4) Aryk!</b>: <font color='#a40000'>What are you trying to say, Alan?</font><br />
<b>(3) Renate</b>: <font color='#000080'>I couldn't reinstall Windows on it because the CD-ROM drive was busticated.</font><br />
<b>(1) Alan</b>: <font color='#000000'>I'm trying to say that I can never really solve this kind of problem because I have no idea what even causes it.</font><br />
<b>(4) Aryk!</b>: <font color='#a40000'>That's what I thought.  :-)</font><br />
<b>(1) Alan</b>: <font color='#000000'>Run AdAware or Spybot or something. Run a virus scanner (but not one of those intrusive pieces of shit that slows down your system by itself)</font><br />
<b>(1) Alan</b>: <font color='#000000'>Defrag.</font><br />
<b>(3) Renate</b>: <font color='#000080'>Norton = bad.</font><br />
<b>(1) Alan</b>: <font color='#000000'>That's about the limit of my advice, unfortunately.</font><br />
<b>(2) Rien</b>: <font color='#5e5b33'>Gee, and all I have to do is figure out Why The Perl Script Doesn't Stop Executing, and Keeps Spawning Baby Scripts.</font><br />
<b>(4) Aryk!</b>: <font color='#a40000'>I ditched Norton a while ago.  When I try to defrag it tells me it doesn't need to.  Ah, well.  What the hell.</font><br />
<b>(4) Aryk!</b>: <font color='#a40000'>Sounds like your Perl Script is homicidal, and you need to get rid of its mate.</font><br />
<b>(3) Renate</b>: <font color='#000080'>You okay, Alan? You sound really stressed.</font><br />
<b>(1) Alan</b>: <font color='#000000'>Yeah, I've tried fixing these kinds of things, and I'll open the system manager, check the processes, nothing's eating RAM, nothing's eating CPU...</font><br />
<b>(1) Alan</b>: <font color='#000000'>the computer just has rickets or something.</font><br />
<b>(4) Aryk!</b>: <font color='#a40000'>I'll take it to the doctor.</font><br />
<b>(1) Alan</b>: <font color='#000000'>Eh. Kind of stressed, I guess. I have a lot of work to clear up this weekend and next week.</font><br />
<b>(3) Renate</b>: <font color='#000080'>just remember, antibiotics are no good for viruses.</font><br />
<font color='#008000'>** (3) Renate <font color='#008000'>nods sagely</font> **</font><br />
<b>(1) Alan</b>: <font color='#000000'>Then it's New York for a few weeks.</font><br />
<b>(3) Renate</b>: <font color='#000080'>oh, it is? you didn't say!</font><br />
<b>(4) Aryk!</b>: <font color='#a40000'>Ah, that's right!</font><br />
<b>(2) Rien</b>: <font color='#5e5b33'>What's New York for a few weeks?</font><br />
<b>(1) Alan</b>: <font color='#000000'>They want to offer me a full-time position, which is very tempting IF they pony up mad scrill.</font><br />
<b>(2) Rien</b>: <font color='#5e5b33'>Oh, wait</font><br />
<b>(2) Rien</b>: <font color='#5e5b33'>Duh</font><br />
<b>(3) Renate</b>: <font color='#000080'>to live in New York? hell yeah it'd HAVE to be mad scrill</font><br />
<b>(1) Alan</b>: <font color='#000000'>Even a studio anywhere remotely awesome is $2000 a month.</font><br />
<b>(3) Renate</b>: <font color='#000080'>yup</font><br />
<b>(3) Renate</b>: <font color='#000080'>ask if you can telecommute</font><br />
<b>(1) Alan</b>: <font color='#000000'>So if they're offering me $75k or more I'll take it.</font><br />
<b>(1) Alan</b>: <font color='#000000'>Yeah, that would be my second thing, but I'm basically doing that already, just not on full hours/salary.</font><br />
<b>(1) Alan</b>: <font color='#000000'>I'll definitely be checking out all the options.</font><br />
<b>(4) Aryk!</b>: <font color='#a40000'>Cool.</font><br />
<b>(3) Renate</b>: <font color='#000080'>well, so you'll do it full hours/salary, and for a lot less if you don't have to move to NYC</font><br />
<b>(3) Renate</b>: <font color='#000080'>sounds like a win/win to me</font><br />
<b>(1) Alan</b>: <font color='#000000'>Actually I was talking to the owner of the local falafel shop, and he says a friend of his telecommuted from Milwaukee to Chicago, then to NYC...</font><br />
<b>(1) Alan</b>: <font color='#000000'>...then they offered him a full-time job in NYC and he took it.</font><br />
<b>(1) Alan</b>: <font color='#000000'>Then DIED IN 9/11.</font><br />
<b>(1) Alan</b>: <font color='#000000'>A cautionary tale if you ask me.</font><br />
<b>(3) Renate</b>: <font color='#000080'>holy shit</font><br />
<b>(4) Aryk!</b>: <font color='#a40000'>Damn.</font><br />
<b>(3) Renate</b>: <font color='#000080'>yes, I admit I was aware that in coming back to Madison I was to some extent escaping the bomb zone</font><br />
<b>(4) Aryk!</b>: <font color='#a40000'>Well, no worries there.  They'll probably go for L.A. next.</font><br />
<b>(1) Alan</b>: <font color='#000000'>"It would have been a major step in his career, but God did not see fit," he said.</font><br />
<b>(3) Renate</b>: <font color='#000080'>ouch</font><br />
<b>(1) Alan</b>: <font color='#000000'>Or San Francisco. Targeted by Aum Shinrikyo, at which point we all go "what, is this 1995?"</font><br />
<b>(1) Alan</b>: <font color='#000000'>Or to be more valley, "1995 called, it wants its terrorists back"</font><br />
<b>(2) Rien</b>: <font color='#5e5b33'>Or, if we're Australian, we go "huh?"</font><br />
<b>(4) Aryk!</b>: <font color='#a40000'>First I'd go, "Wait, who's Aum Shinrikyo?"</font><br />
<b>(1) Alan</b>: <font color='#000000'>Tokyo subway nerve gas attack.</font><br />
<b>(3) Renate</b>: <font color='#000080'>Sarin gas on the -- yeah.</font><br />
<b>(4) Aryk!</b>: <font color='#a40000'>Ah.</font><br />
<b>(4) Aryk!</b>: <font color='#a40000'>That I know.</font><br />
<b>(1) Alan</b>: <font color='#000000'>One of the most successful such attacks pre-9/11 actually.</font><br />
<b>(2) Rien</b>: <font color='#5e5b33'>I don't, but I do know what Sarin gas is.  Nasty stuff.</font><br />
<b>(4) Aryk!</b>: <font color='#a40000'>Wasn't too hip on international news until recently.  Now I value it more than regular news by far.</font><br />
<b>(3) Renate</b>: <font color='#000080'>yup, and one of the few chemical/biological attacks successfully targeting random civilians</font><br />
<b>(3) Renate</b>: <font color='#000080'>(not perpetrated by an army, that is)</font><br />
<b>(1) Alan</b>: <font color='#000000'>Before 9/11, most of the experts considered major metropolis terrorist attacks a minor threat. (Which was one of the main reasons 9/11 was able to happen.)</font><br />
<b>(1) Alan</b>: <font color='#000000'>But then you run into the black swan problem. You can't prevent what you can't even imagine.</font><br />
<b>(3) Renate</b>: <font color='#000080'>Well, and so now what we get is what Bruce Schneier calls "security theatre."</font><br />
<b>(1) Alan</b>: <font color='#000000'>Hah, yeah.</font><br />
<b>(3) Renate</b>: <font color='#000080'>Like how I can't carry fucking SHAMPOO on airplanes.</font><br />
<b>(4) Aryk!</b>: <font color='#a40000'>Yup.</font><br />
<b>(1) Alan</b>: <font color='#000000'>It could be exploding shampoo.</font><br />
<b>(3) Renate</b>: <font color='#000080'>"Movie plot threats," Schneier calls it.</font><br />
<b>(4) Aryk!</b>: <font color='#a40000'>Or why you can't bring a lighter, but matches are okay.  Figure that one out.</font><br />
<b>(1) Alan</b>: <font color='#000000'>You can't bring velociraptor eggs, but a live T-rex? no problem!</font><br />
<b>(1) Alan</b>: <font color='#000000'>There's just no single standard.</font><br />
<b>(3) Renate</b>: <font color='#000080'>lol</font><br />
<b>(1) Alan</b>: <font color='#000000'>Okay. This is going to be one of those "wandering around figuring out what's going on" sessions.</font><br />
<b>(1) Alan</b>: <font color='#000000'><hr /></font><br />
<b>(1) Alan</b>: <font color='#000000'><i>I hope this letter finds you in good health,</i> the letter began, followed by a paragraph or two of pleasantries re: Renate's well-being, Coris's equal well-being, the broadness of the sky this close to the Eastlands, the unexpectedly early spring.</font><br />
<b>(1) Alan</b>: <font color='#000000'><i>...but we find ourselves beset on all sides by dragons. Artimecia has taken personal command of her Mage Knights, and more: she heads a mage guild army as if her Sunese misadventure were just a feint.</i></font><br />
<b>(1) Alan</b>: <font color='#000000'><i>Chroma is among them, and Keph LoCaine&#8212;and altogether the guild forces share an unpleasantly opportunistic and bloodthirsty look.</i></font><br />
<b>(1) Alan</b>: <font color='#000000'><i>No less opportunistic, and scarcely less bloodthirsty, are the southern dragons, first among them one Blizzard King Margadas. They have spent the last months at each other's throats, but Margadas seems well positioned to take away the prize.</i></font><br />
<b>(1) Alan</b>: <font color='#000000'><i>And unspoken, the fact that the true prize is an alliance with Artimecia, and all the Sages' Republic territory once the rebellious mages themselves are subdued.</i></font><br />
<b>(1) Alan</b>: <font color='#000000'><i>I have had some clashes with a young man who troubles me greatly. He is likely to trouble you as well. I cannot say more, only that you should avoid a mercenary band called the New Scourge.</i>.</font><br />
<i><b>(2) Rien</b>:  (whispering): <font color='#5e5b33'>A sure way to get Renate to look them up.</font></i><br />
<b>(1) Alan</b>: <font color='#000000'>And then there are more pleasantries, formulaic inquiries after the health of people Renate might have seen more recently than Coris.</font><br />
<b>(3) Renate</b>: <font color='#000080'>"Avoid them?" Renate blurts aloud. "I've only been looking for them for months now!"</font><br />
<b>(3) Renate</b>: <font color='#000080'>"Some days I hate being blind."</font><br />
<b>(1) Alan</b>: <font color='#000000'><i>I cannot say why, but I suspect I will see you soon. I would as soon be out of the middle of this maelstrom, but my men and I believe in Rainstone, and through him believe in the Sages' Republic, so here we stay... you, on the other hand, seem irresistibly drawn to such bad weather.</i></font><br />
<b>(2) Rien</b>: <font color='#5e5b33'>"I think we're going to have to leave here soon, if this is to be taken care of," Rien says softly as he sits back in his chair.</font><br />
<b>(1) Alan</b>: <font color='#000000'><i>If you come here, name the Black Sheep as your guarantors. Despite Rainstone's watchful eye, the local dragon lord Daggertooth is jealous of his new territory, and resents sharing it with Rainstone or the Sages' Republic... even though they are the only ones holding it for him.</i></font><br />
<b>(3) Renate</b>: <font color='#000080'>"Taken care of? With what six armies?"</font><br />
<b>(3) Renate</b>: <font color='#000080'>"Poor Coris. He sounds terribly blue."</font><br />
<b>(1) Alan</b>: <font color='#000000'><i>With love, your obedient servant, Coris Nightblade</i></font><br />
<b>(2) Rien</b>: <font color='#5e5b33'>"With no six armies.  But we do have a dragon to take down there, too.  And he does.  Do you think there's anything we can do to help?"</font><br />
<b>(3) Renate</b>: <font color='#000080'>"No. But are we going anyway? Yes. I have to find Aaron's boy. I said I would. And we also have to redeem your word."</font><br />
<b>(1) Alan</b>: <font color='#000000'>(It's around fourthmonth, so it's up to you what you've been doing since Sune. The king named you heroes of the realm and provided you with 100g each and the promise of more whenever you drop by (whether you ask or not).</font><br />
<b>(3) Renate</b>: <font color='#000080'>(Could Renate keep the lasso? She really liked it.)</font><br />
<b>(1) Alan</b>: <font color='#000000'>(Of course.)</font><br />
<b>(1) Alan</b>: <font color='#000000'>All opposition to his reign has effectively ended. He owned up to the angelic shenanigans, pre-empting any attempt by the Silver Tree to bring it up.</font><br />
<b>(3) Renate</b>: <font color='#000080'>(Renate's been hunting Aaron's boy, apparently rather fruitlessly.)</font><br />
<b>(3) Renate</b>: <font color='#000080'>(And gathering intel on Chroma, probably -- she would have asked the king's intelligencers, certainly.)</font><br />
<b>(2) Rien</b>: <font color='#5e5b33'>(Rien's been helping her, hitting up his Contacts for information when he can)</font><br />
<b>(3) Renate</b>: <font color='#000080'>(Be stupid not to.)</font><br />
<b>(1) Alan</b>: <font color='#000000'>Artimecia did a face-saving dance to the effect that she thought he was controlled by Shadow-watcher, so she was assisting "loyal citizens of the realm" in "helping their ruler regain his senses"</font><br />
<b>(2) Rien</b>: <font color='#5e5b33'>(That too)</font><br />
<b>(1) Alan</b>: <font color='#000000'>All totally bull, and nobody anywhere was taken in for a second, but it was barely enough to preserve the fragile illusions of state.</font><br />
<b>(2) Rien</b>: <font color='#5e5b33'>I certainly hope that that didn't work.</font><br />
<b>(1) Alan</b>: <font color='#000000'>Which, if shattered, would put King Sesshu in the position of having to turn Genjiro loose on ... what, exactly?</font><br />
<b>(1) Alan</b>: <font color='#000000'>The Guild of Mage Knights? Vollis?</font><br />
<b>(1) Alan</b>: <font color='#000000'>Artimecia's teleport-capable Mage Knights?</font><br />
<b>(2) Rien</b>: <font color='#5e5b33'>I wouldn't mind his help against Chroma.</font><br />
<b>(1) Alan</b>: <font color='#000000'>That's a definite possibility. You could send a telegram. They've got to be watching the developments around the Sages' Republic area.</font><br />
<b>(1) Alan</b>: <font color='#000000'>The Sunese definitely aren't forgetting. They're just saving it up.</font><br />
<b>(2) Rien</b>: <font color='#5e5b33'>(Saving up to hit a referee with a whiskey bottle)</font><br />
<b>(3) Renate</b>: <font color='#000080'>I'm not sure we should do that unless we know we need to. We can only call Sune once, I'm guessing.</font><br />
<b>(3) Renate</b>: <font color='#000080'>It better be important when we do.</font><br />
<b>(3) Renate</b>: <font color='#000080'>Of course, Hideki being Hideki, he might well be thrilled to have the excuse.</font><br />
<b>(2) Rien</b>: <font color='#5e5b33'>This is true.</font><br />
<b>(3) Renate</b>: <font color='#000080'>But Hideki is the kind who will recklessly burn out his army for an insignificant gain.</font><br />
<b>(3) Renate</b>: <font color='#000080'>So I think I still incline toward "not yet."</font><br />
<b>(3) Renate</b>: <font color='#000080'>We could use allies, though.</font><br />
<b>(3) Renate</b>: <font color='#000080'>What are the Cloudgatherers up to lately?</font><br />
<b>(3) Renate</b>: <font color='#000080'>And Renate will pass word to Emil where she's going and what she's doing, and she's not too proud to ask for help.</font><br />
<b>(1) Alan</b>: <font color='#000000'>Hideki's a tactical and strategic genius, but on the level even above that is the political, and he has none of that.</font><br />
<b>(1) Alan</b>: <font color='#000000'>He's just like "hey, a war. Okay."</font><br />
<b>(3) Renate</b>: <font color='#000080'>Right. So if we call him, it better be the right war.</font><br />
<b>(1) Alan</b>: <font color='#000000'>The Cloudgatherers are in Karth, engaged in some sort of standoff with the Black Fang Emperor himself. Nobody's sure what it's about.</font><br />
<b>(3) Renate</b>: <font color='#000080'>Great. How about the Psychic Investigators?</font><br />
<b>(3) Renate</b>: <font color='#000080'>Ander screwed us over. He owes us.</font><br />
<b>(1) Alan</b>: <font color='#000000'>They're already represented in the Sages' Republic. Honorary, as it were.</font><br />
<b>(1) Alan</b>: <font color='#000000'>As one of the few guilds not headed by a dragon, they feel a kinship.</font><br />
<b>(3) Renate</b>: <font color='#000080'>Well, looks like we'll just have to go in and rustle up allies on our own, then. Or join whatever caravan looks likeliest to kick Chroma's butt.</font><br />
<b>(3) Renate</b>: <font color='#000080'>Rien or Aryk got any ideas?</font><br />
<b>(2) Rien</b>: <font color='#5e5b33'>None beyond that.  Rien's studying what he can of Chroma's magic, trying to come up with counter measures.  Chroma was the head ofa guild that specialised in splash-damange magic.</font><br />
<b>(4) Aryk</b>: <font color='#a40000'>(Aryk is with Renate 100% in locating Aaron's child and the book, but beyond that, anything he wants to accomplish is purely personal.)</font><br />
<b>(3) Renate</b>: <font color='#000080'>(Understandable. Renate knows he wants to find Emily, and as Emily seems to be with Aaron's boy...)</font><br />
<b>(3) Renate</b>: <font color='#000080'>Oooh, area-of-effect spells. No fun.</font><br />
<b>(3) Renate</b>: <font color='#000080'>We might have to use some of those fancy anti-magic shells of yours, Rien.</font><br />
<b>(1) Alan</b>: <font color='#000000'>Chroma invented a lot of the Explodist standbys, like Lock (all spells home in on the target, even other people's) and Arm (buffer spells to go off all at once).</font><br />
<b>(1) Alan</b>: <font color='#000000'>He also invented Explosive Thunder (a knockdown lightning AoE) and the legendary Chroma Thunder (a multi-elemental explosion).</font><br />
<b>(2) Rien</b>: <font color='#5e5b33'>Yeah, I know.  I used to play an Explodist :)</font><br />
<b>(1) Alan</b>: <font color='#000000'>Ah, good point.</font><br />
<b>(3) Renate</b>: <font color='#000080'>Whoosh. Sounds like a tough egg.</font><br />
<b>(3) Renate</b>: <font color='#000080'>The question is, can he blow himself up?</font><br />
<b>(2) Rien</b>: <font color='#5e5b33'>Any spell that can be developed can be countermanded.</font><br />
<b>(3) Renate</b>: <font color='#000080'>Eh, well. I shall think on this, and attempt to come up with Yet Another Foolhardy But Hopefully Amusing Plan.</font><br />
<b>(3) Renate</b>: <font color='#000080'>In the meantime, off we go.</font><br />
<b>(1) Alan</b>: <font color='#000000'>Like a lot of dragons, Chroma has never been defeated because he has never fought anything worthy of him.</font><br />
<b>(1) Alan</b>: <font color='#000000'>He's crushed a lot of things, but manages to cleverly avoid fair fights.</font><br />
<b>(1) Alan</b>: <font color='#000000'>Which is a type of fighting skill in itself, one often underestimated.</font><br />
<b>(3) Renate</b>: <font color='#000080'>heh</font><br />
<b>(3) Renate</b>: <font color='#000080'>I am having ideas already... but I need to know more about the situation first. So off we go a-hunting, of Emilies and Young Master Wrenfalls and Nightblades and Chromas and whathaveyou.</font><br />
<b>(4) Aryk</b>: <font color='#a40000'>Aryk enters.  He's done away with the white cloak.  If it ever had any symbolic meaning, some sort of righteous vision, it's gone now.  He's traded it in for a black one instead.  The handle of his einhander can be seen poking out of it at his hip.  The cloak is complete with a hood, which is currentl draped around his shoulders.  The headband with the single jewel is still present, but the trademark baggy pants, ones he wore nearly every day for the last couple of years, are gone, given way to leathers.  He still bears the trusty leather boots and gloves, and the sharp red hero vest (though permanently soiled), but his new cloak masks his attire well.  His kneepads still, possibly assuringly, still bear the tear-drop flame of Michael.  His first comment is, "I traded in the white cloak.  Got a discount on this one.  The white one just wasn't me.  Are we off, then?" </font><br />
<b>(2) Rien</b>: <font color='#5e5b33'>Verily.</font><br />
<b>(1) Alan</b>: <font color='#000000'>Wall of Text crits you for 10391. You die.</font><br />
<b>(2) Rien</b>: <font color='#5e5b33'>And Rien's going to visit Kandor at some point, and see what his favourite Chaos Tree can tell him about Chroma's magic.</font><br />
<b>(4) Aryk</b>: <font color='#a40000'>(Just wanted to throw that out there.)</font><br />
<b>(1) Alan</b>: <font color='#000000'>(No, it's cool actually. I like the new look.)</font><br />
<b>(4) Aryk</b>: <font color='#a40000'>(Gotta establish that fluff piece and all.)</font><br />
<b>(1) Alan</b>: <font color='#000000'>All right... first thing is to choose an approach. To the north of the Sages' Republic is the wilderness of Maal, dotted with hobgoblin towns and strongholds but by no means civilized.</font><br />
<b>(1) Alan</b>: <font color='#000000'>To the east is, well, the Eastlands. Basically the same thing, only with plains instead of mountains.</font><br />
<b>(3) Renate</b>: <font color='#000080'>"I think we're off. You look good, brother."</font><br />
<b>(4) Aryk</b>: <font color='#a40000'>"Yeah?"  Aryk smirks.  "Thanks.  I had better.  That was the last ounce of dough I had."</font><br />
<b>(3) Renate</b>: <font color='#000080'>I suspect Renate was tooling around Maal looking for Aaron's boy. So sounds like it's the plains for us.</font><br />
<b>(1) Alan</b>: <font color='#000000'>To the south and west are Patchwork Kingdoms&#8212;probably the most direct ways, but also occupied by Artimecia's combined forces in the west and the warring but hostile kingdoms to the south.</font><br />
<b>(3) Renate</b>: <font color='#000080'>"That must have been a hefty tithe."</font><br />
<b>(2) Rien</b>: <font color='#5e5b33'>(There's no way Aryk could spend 100 gold on that outfit)</font><br />
<b>(3) Renate</b>: <font color='#000080'>(Thus Renate's comment about the tithe.)</font><br />
<b>(3) Renate</b>: <font color='#000080'>Well, Renate had half an errand in Vesper, actually.</font><br />
<b>(3) Renate</b>: <font color='#000080'>Except that she can't go in the place!</font><br />
<b>(4) Aryk</b>: <font color='#a40000'>(No, I had WAY less than that.  Last time I checked I had like A gold.  Any money he may have accrued since the Troubleshooter days have pretty much gone to collection boxes, but mostly to you two, since he knows he'd just blow it.)</font><br />
<b>(1) Alan</b>: <font color='#000000'>Yeah, Hyuri isn't going to forget her.</font><br />
<b>(2) Rien</b>: <font color='#5e5b33'>Rien'll go for her, if she wants.</font><br />
<b>(3) Renate</b>: <font color='#000080'>(Matt, did you miss the bit where Sesshu gave us 100Gs each?)</font><br />
<b>(3) Renate</b>: <font color='#000080'>She just wants to know if he took the offer her mother made.</font><br />
<b>(1) Alan</b>: <font color='#000000'>(Well, the king gave each of you 100g, and ordered his people to keep giving you gold each time you come back whether you want it or not.)</font><br />
<b>(1) Alan</b>: <font color='#000000'>(You could just retire in Sune at this point.)</font><br />
<b>(3) Renate</b>: <font color='#000080'>(Believe me, Renate considered it!)</font><br />
<b>(3) Renate</b>: <font color='#000080'>(A home, I mean, really, it's all she wants out of life...)</font><br />
<b>(4) Aryk</b>: <font color='#a40000'>(I guess I did.  But he'd just keep like one for himself, drop a few in the Raphaelit church, and give Renate or Rien the rest.)</font><br />
<b>(2) Rien</b>: <font color='#5e5b33'>(And they'd promptly give it back)</font><br />
<b>(4) Aryk</b>: <font color='#a40000'>(Aryk too, but he's not ready for that yet.)</font><br />
<b>(3) Renate</b>: <font color='#000080'>(Renate will keep his accounts for him if he wants her to. But she thinks he ought to learn himself, sometime.)</font><br />
<b>(4) Aryk</b>: <font color='#a40000'>(It's more a matter of he just doesn't want it.)</font><br />
<b>(4) Aryk</b>: <font color='#a40000'>(His gauntlet is full.  He's got new clothes.  He's happy.)</font><br />
<b>(3) Renate</b>: <font color='#000080'>(Hmph. Renate will keep his accounts for him, then.)</font><br />
<b>(2) Rien</b>: <font color='#5e5b33'>(Rien wouldn't mind having a home, either, but he's damn sure he's not going to be allowed to have one)</font><br />
<b>(4) Aryk</b>: <font color='#a40000'>(Bah, Rien could buy one wherever he pleased.)</font><br />
<b>(3) Renate</b>: <font color='#000080'>Well, so is Hyuri willing to trade a promise of sanctuary for the latest in agricultural advances?</font><br />
<b>(3) Renate</b>: <font color='#000080'>(That being the bargain Clara offered.)</font><br />
<b>(3) Renate</b>: <font color='#000080'>(At Renate's instigation, of course.)</font><br />
<b>(2) Rien</b>: <font color='#5e5b33'>(Yeah, he probably could, but would it remain inviolate?  I don't think so)</font><br />
<b>(1) Alan</b>: <font color='#000000'>Hm, just safe passage for Renate? He's known as a good ruler. Just proud, like all dragons.</font><br />
<b>(1) Alan</b>: <font color='#000000'>I think he'd accept.</font><br />
<b>(1) Alan</b>: <font color='#000000'>It's been a while. People probably remember an Emilia Eaglebourne that has no resemblance to Renate anyway.</font><br />
<b>(3) Renate</b>: <font color='#000080'>No, the bargain was that Karlbotel would supply him with cultivars, as long as he promised to grow them (rather than sell them right off), AND as long as he promised to hold space for any refugees from Karlbotel in the upcoming war.</font><br />
<b>(4) Aryk</b>: <font color='#a40000'>(She's not seven feet tall and carrying a giant oyster fork, for one.)</font><br />
<b>(3) Renate</b>: <font color='#000080'>I can dig up the fluff for you if you want. :)</font><br />
<b>(2) Rien</b>: <font color='#5e5b33'>I think this was for most of Karlbotel, actually, in the event of Heaven invasion of the Silver Coast.</font><br />
<b>(3) Renate</b>: <font color='#000080'>thank you, Adrian, yes</font><br />
<b>(1) Alan</b>: <font color='#000000'>Doh, yeah. That's been a while.</font><br />
<b>(3) Renate</b>: <font color='#000080'>As for Emilia Eaglebourne, Renate admits to that whole scheme now; she doesn't even blame it on Godfrey. If Hyuri lets her in, she'll come in, but otherwise, she respects his edict.</font><br />
<b>(1) Alan</b>: <font color='#000000'>Yeah, actually he'd accept that, if he were to take a third of the total population of Karlbotel as refugees. His area is about the same size.</font><br />
<b>(3) Renate</b>: <font color='#000080'>And would even if she herself became a refugee from Karlbotel.</font><br />
<b>(3) Renate</b>: <font color='#000080'>Figuring that a lot will die... yes, okay, much better than nothing. Deal.</font><br />
<b>(3) Renate</b>: <font color='#000080'>And that takes a certain amount of weight off Renate's shoulders. Good.</font><br />
<b>(3) Renate</b>: <font color='#000080'>Renate will telegraph her mother to start shipping, then.</font><br />
<b>(1) Alan</b>: <font color='#000000'>Okay, so let's say you're coming down out of Maal... this means you probably were able to pay a visit to Shrapnel Dragon, if that's still an issue.</font><br />
<b>(3) Renate</b>: <font color='#000080'>Okay, now you lost me. Who's Shrapnel Dragon?</font><br />
<b>(1) Alan</b>: <font color='#000000'>I don't even remember why you would have wanted to, but way way back at the dawn of time that worthy was presented as the answer to some problem you were having.</font><br />
<b>(1) Alan</b>: <font color='#000000'>He's a dragon inventor who lives in isolation in Maal.</font><br />
<b>(1) Alan</b>: <font color='#000000'>(He made Zion campaign Kodaku a heatproof metal armor set out of farm machinery. His shoulderplates said "NOT A STEP")</font><br />
<b>(3) Renate</b>: <font color='#000080'>Oh. Interesting. Well, I can think of some inventions I'd like invented, but they're mostly anti-dragon inventions, so I'd be hesitant to propose them!</font><br />
<b>(4) Aryk</b>: <font color='#a40000'>(That's awesome)</font><br />
<b>(1) Alan</b>: <font color='#000000'>Yeah, he doesn't vibe on the usual dragon ambitions, but probably would not volunteer to help you kill them either.</font><br />
<b>(3) Renate</b>: <font color='#000080'>Well, I tell you what, we wouldn't mind stopping by and looking at his stuff, with all due fulsome praise.</font><br />
<b>(3) Renate</b>: <font color='#000080'>But I don't have anything immediate that I want, unless he's got any bright ideas about Keph LoCaine.</font><br />
<b>(3) Renate</b>: <font color='#000080'>Like, an anti-magic water balloon. That would be good.</font><br />
<b>(1) Alan</b>: <font color='#000000'>Well, he has all sorts of inventions, mostly of more interest to Rien than Renate or Aryk.</font><br />
<b>(3) Renate</b>: <font color='#000080'>But like you keep saying, Alan, it's not supposed to be about the stuff. *shrug*</font><br />
<b>(3) Renate</b>: <font color='#000080'>well, Rien can go hog-wild, then! :)</font><br />
<b>(2) Rien</b>: <font color='#5e5b33'>Oh?  Such as?</font><br />
<b>(1) Alan</b>: <font color='#000000'>But he also has plenty of things Renate can appreciate off the bat, like farm equipment (including a really spiffy ox-drawn tiller).</font><br />
<b>(3) Renate</b>: <font color='#000080'>ooooh! well, whatever he's willing to ship, Renate will buy off him!</font><br />
<b>(2) Rien</b>: <font color='#5e5b33'>(A rotating hay thresher too?)</font><br />
<b>(1) Alan</b>: <font color='#000000'>Oh, I just meant things so theoretical that it takes a mage to get them.</font><br />
<b>(3) Renate</b>: <font color='#000080'>Like anti-magic water balloons.</font><br />
<b>(1) Alan</b>: <font color='#000000'>Right.</font><br />
<font color='#008000'>** (3) Renate <font color='#008000'>nods sagely again</font> **</font><br />
<b>(2) Rien</b>: <font color='#5e5b33'>Which Rien would probably buy afew of.</font><br />
<b>(1) Alan</b>: <font color='#000000'>Well, it turns out he has contracts with various other entrepreneurs, who license and manufacture his stuff, but he's willing to send a few samples to Karlbotel if you can get them shopped around to the wealthier Silver Coast landlord types.</font><br />
<b>(1) Alan</b>: <font color='#000000'>He mostly wants money to finance his more obscure and conceptual research, but he definitely seems to need a lot of it.</font><br />
<b>(3) Renate</b>: <font color='#000080'>Sure. We can do that. We should try to manage it by proxy, however, so as not to disturb further the shaky illusion that Renate and her family are still on the outs.</font><br />
<b>(3) Renate</b>: <font color='#000080'>Baron Rainer is a provident man. I'm sure he's got agents.</font><br />
<b>(3) Renate</b>: <font color='#000080'>But that's minor. No, we don't need to make a big deal of the Shrapnel Dragon.</font><br />
<b>(4) Aryk</b>: <font color='#a40000'>If he's got a camera, Aryk will buy one of those. </font><br />
<b>(3) Renate</b>: <font color='#000080'>blackmail photos?</font><br />
<b>(4) Aryk</b>: <font color='#a40000'>Keepsakes.  Whatever.  He saw his first one in Sune, and now he's interested in how they work.</font><br />
<b>(4) Aryk</b>: <font color='#a40000'>Knowing him, he'll probably use it a few times, take it apart to see what makes them tick, and then forget how to put it back together.</font><br />
<b>(3) Renate</b>: <font color='#000080'>Hey, maybe the Shrapnel Dragon has the gadget that Renate suggested to Colette -- a text-reader.</font><br />
<b>(1) Alan</b>: <font color='#000000'>Yeah, he actually has a pretty good miniature camera (i.e. about the size of a modern digicam)...</font><br />
<b>(1) Alan</b>: <font color='#000000'>It uses old style flash rubies instead of flash diamonds, so it only takes oddly washed-out black and white.</font><br />
<b>(4) Aryk</b>: <font color='#a40000'>Sweet, if Renate will allocate some of those funds of his over his way, he'lll buy it and wear it around his neck.</font><br />
<b>(1) Alan</b>: <font color='#000000'>But it's durable and compact, and most film labs can handle it.</font><br />
<b>(3) Renate</b>: <font color='#000080'>Sure.</font><br />
<b>(3) Renate</b>: <font color='#000080'>Curious sort of bling.</font><br />
<b>(1) Alan</b>: <font color='#000000'>The concept of the text reader interests him. And he's never actually met a blind human, so he offers to try whipping something up in exchange for a bit of medical research on how Renate's nerves have adapted.</font><br />
<b>(4) Aryk</b>: <font color='#a40000'>Eh, he wears that pendant he bought as a charm on his blade now.</font><br />
<b>(3) Renate</b>: <font color='#000080'>Fair trade. Renate's all for it.</font><br />
<b>(1) Alan</b>: <font color='#000000'>The device he comes up with is about the size of a typewriter, you hold it over the book, so the book has to be able to open fairly flat.</font><br />
<b>(3) Renate</b>: <font color='#000080'>Wouldn't have any trouble with letters, though. That's cool.</font><br />
<b>(1) Alan</b>: <font color='#000000'>It only really handles a range of serif typefaces, and it's a bit slow, but it's still a huge improvement.</font><br />
<b>(1) Alan</b>: <font color='#000000'>It makes a lot of errors, but they're predictable and easy to resolve through context.</font><br />
<b>(3) Renate</b>: <font color='#000080'>Renate'll take it. And any schematics for it that she can send to Colette, who can probably improve on it.</font><br />
<b>(1) Alan</b>: <font color='#000000'>Considering that he put it together in three days out of spare parts, it's a work of genius.</font><br />
<b>(3) Renate</b>: <font color='#000080'>I believe it!</font><br />
<b>(4) Aryk</b>: <font color='#a40000'>The only problem is that top of it says, "Do not operate if under the influence of alchohol."</font><br />
<b>(3) Renate</b>: <font color='#000080'>hrh</font><br />
<b>(3) Renate</b>: <font color='#000080'>heh, that is</font><br />
<b>(3) Renate</b>: <font color='#000080'>Okay, we sound righteously gizmoed out now.</font><br />
<b>(3) Renate</b>: <font color='#000080'>What's next?</font><br />
<b>(1) Alan</b>: <font color='#000000'>Sorry, tabbing between this, Justin, coffee, and the bathroom. One sec!</font><br />
<b>(1) Alan</b>: <font color='#000000'>Darn it, I need a piece of lore I don't have... I guess I'll work around it.</font><br />
<b>(1) Alan</b>: <font color='#000000'>Where the foothills of Maal fade into the rolling plains of the Patchworks near the Eastlands, there is a river named the Maranda.</font><br />
<b>(1) Alan</b>: <font color='#000000'>It flows narrow and fast at this time of year; herds of sheep gather there to drink, and villages mark it with waterwheels and fish traps.</font><br />
<b>(1) Alan</b>: <font color='#000000'>This stretch is unmarked and wild for as far as the eye can see in all directions; it runs across your path, diverting you to look for a bridge or risk a crossing.</font><br />
<b>(3) Renate</b>: <font color='#000080'>"We all know I can't swim, right?"</font><br />
<b>(1) Alan</b>: <font color='#000000'>Aryk alone feels a sense of danger; the heavens seem too bright, and when he glances up the iron-gray billowing clouds are a surprise&#8212;there should have been stars.</font><br />
<b>(4) Aryk</b>: <font color='#a40000'>Aryk looks above.  "Evil is at work."</font><br />
<b>(3) Renate</b>: <font color='#000080'>"What's wrong?" Renate asks in a low voice.</font><br />
<b>(4) Aryk</b>: <font color='#a40000'>"My paladin sense is tingling.  And I don't like the look of that sky."</font><br />
<b>(3) Renate</b>: <font color='#000080'>"Oh. Cross, or no cross?"</font><br />
<b>(1) Alan</b>: <font color='#000000'>The sky is perfectly normal, if depressingly dirty.</font><br />
<b>(2) Rien</b>: <font color='#5e5b33'>Rien looks up, "weren't there stars up there a while ago?"</font><br />
<b>(1) Alan</b>: <font color='#000000'>There is only a lonely fisherman, sitting on an uncomfortable rock dangling a lure from a rod.</font><br />
<b>(1) Alan</b>: <font color='#000000'>(Rien doesn't see them. It's the middle of the day.)</font><br />
<b>(3) Renate</b>: <font color='#000080'>Really? Renate doesn't feel anybody else around?</font><br />
<b>(2) Rien</b>: <font color='#5e5b33'>(Okay... difference of perception, then)</font><br />
<b>(1) Alan</b>: <font color='#000000'>The fisherman is southwest down the river, just a black outline at this distance.</font><br />
<font color='#008000'>** (4) Aryk 's gaze turn away from skyward to the fisherman.  He leads his horse toward that direction. **</font><br />
<b>(1) Alan</b>: <font color='#000000'>Renate is beginning to sense danger as well, just the faintest edge; but it's coming from the direction opposite the fisherman.</font><br />
<b>(1) Alan</b>: <font color='#000000'>For Aryk, on the other hand, it feels like the <i>situation</i> is dangerous. It's generalized.</font><br />
<b>(3) Renate</b>: <font color='#000080'>She clears her throat. "Keep going. I'll be back." At the nearest good opportunity, she fades back and circles warily around behind them.</font><br />
<b>(1) Alan</b>: <font color='#000000'>Going full stealth, unmounted?</font><br />
<b>(1) Alan</b>: <font color='#000000'>Or just riding?</font><br />
<b>(2) Rien</b>: <font color='#5e5b33'>Rien will line up spells and such in his mind, quietly getting ready for whatever.</font><br />
<b>(3) Renate</b>: <font color='#000080'>Full stealth. Trying to sound like an animal at the inevitable scuffles and collisions with things.</font><br />
<b>(1) Alan</b>: <font color='#000000'>Yeah, not many eyes out here to see by.</font><br />
<b>(3) Renate</b>: <font color='#000080'>But I think the best thing for her to do is find a hidey-spot and see if whatever was behind us comes after Rien and Aryk.</font><br />
<b>(1) Alan</b>: <font color='#000000'>The fisherman is bundled up in a hooded parka against the early spring chill. He twitches the fishing pole idly, keeping his lure moving.</font><br />
<b>(1) Alan</b>: <font color='#000000'>A bundle is lying by the rock, within arm's reach of the fisherman; an einhander in a black-enameled sheath lies across it.</font><br />
<b>(3) Renate</b>: <font color='#000080'>(Oh, that's just fucking GREAT.)</font><br />
<b>(4) Aryk</b>: <font color='#a40000'>Aryk says within earshot of Rien.  "The danger feels all around," but is quickly out of earshot as he trots up to the fisherman (but only within speaking distance).  "Hello there, Mr. Fisherman.  Any luck today?" He says, eyes glued to the einhander, hand lowering itself casually to the handle of his own.</font><br />
<b>(1) Alan</b>: <font color='#000000'>And on the far horizon, in the direction Renate is patrolling, four soaring dragons come into view, far away yet.</font><br />
<b>(3) Renate</b>: <font color='#000080'>(Stahl and the Reavers. Run. Now.)</font><br />
<b>(4) Aryk</b>: <font color='#a40000'>(First thought I had.)</font><br />
<b>(1) Alan</b>: <font color='#000000'>"This is probably the biggest coincidence ever," Garland says, not tossing back his hood or moving his hands from his fishing pole.</font><br />
<b>(3) Renate</b>: <font color='#000080'>(Renate's looking for the fifth one. On the ground.)</font><br />
<b>(1) Alan</b>: <font color='#000000'>"I stop for two hours to fish up lunch. Hoping I can get it and sneak back to a hiding spot before the Reavers show up. And who shows up first? Aryk Lazarus?"</font><br />
<b>(1) Alan</b>: <font color='#000000'>"Normally we would have to fight or something, but really I have quite a lot to handle right now."</font><br />
<b>(4) Aryk</b>: <font color='#a40000'>Aryk's danger sense is beginning to reach boiling point.  He struggles not to make any sudden moves, but his hand is know white-knuckled on the einhander's handle.  He doesn't know what to say.  He dismounts quickly.</font><br />
<b>(1) Alan</b>: <font color='#000000'>Renate can feel an unusual sound in the forest, a faint vibration in the earth; the fifth dragon is barrelling through the light woods, knocking aside scrub and frail trees.</font><br />
<b>(3) Renate</b>: <font color='#000080'>Well... crap.</font><br />
<b>(3) Renate</b>: <font color='#000080'>She'll give the alarm... but she'll try to throw her voice when she does it!</font><br />
<b>(3) Renate</b>: <font color='#000080'>And then seeking out another hidey-spot would seem a wise precaution.</font><br />
<b>(4) Aryk</b>: <font color='#a40000'>"We face the Reavers, then."</font><br />
<b>(1) Alan</b>: <font color='#000000'>Garland glances to the horizon, and Aryk sees his face; it's covered in makeshift mud camouflage. "Oh, I was planning on running. I'm not interested in fighting them yet."</font><br />
<b>(1) Alan</b>: <font color='#000000'>"If you have to fight them, do it, but I'd rather you saved them for later."</font><br />
<b>(4) Aryk</b>: <font color='#a40000'>"What you'd rather do interests me little, Garland."</font><br />
<font color='#008000'>** (4) Aryk turns to face the coming Reavers. **</font><br />
<b>(1) Alan</b>: <font color='#000000'>"Not very smart," Garland says, hopping off his rock and picking up his bundle.</font><br />
<b>(4) Aryk</b>: <font color='#a40000'>"Not known for it."</font><br />
<b>(1) Alan</b>: <font color='#000000'>With the fishing pole across his shoulders, he starts to run in the opposite direction, zig-zagging off into the woods.</font><br />
<b>(4) Aryk</b>: <font color='#a40000'>"REAVERS!  ALL OF THEM!"  Aryk calls out loudly.</font><br />
<font color='#008000'>** (3) Renate <font color='#008000'>comes scuttling out of the underbrush like a scalded cat.</font> **</font><br />
<b>(3) Renate</b>: <font color='#000080'>"I know! Can we be elsewhere now, please?"</font><br />
<font color='#008000'>** (2) Rien <font color='#008000'>grabs Aryk's arm and drags him off jsuyt as fast as he can.</font> **</font><br />
<b>(4) Aryk</b>: <font color='#a40000'>Seeing his friends flee, Aryk comes to his senses and sprints alongside Rien.</font><br />
<b>(1) Alan</b>: <font color='#000000'>The four airborne dragons have swooped low, skimming the treetops; and the fifth bursts out of the woods and jumps over the river, scampering along its clear far side.</font><br />
<b>(1) Alan</b>: <font color='#000000'>As long as you aren't attacking them, they whoosh right past you.</font><br />
<b>(4) Aryk</b>: <font color='#a40000'>(No, I believe we are hauling ass.)</font><br />
<b>(1) Alan</b>: <font color='#000000'>And keep going, roaring down the river with an ominous growl.</font><br />
<b>(1) Alan</b>: <font color='#000000'>Garland seems to have just disappeared.</font><br />
<b>(3) Renate</b>: <font color='#000080'>Hell no, we are not attacking.</font><br />
<b>(4) Aryk</b>: <font color='#a40000'>We are?!!</font><br />
<b>(3) Renate</b>: <font color='#000080'>We have no immediate quarrel with them, and they'd KICK OUR ASSES ANYWAY.</font><br />
<b>(4) Aryk</b>: <font color='#a40000'>Oh, NOT attacking.  Phew.</font><br />
<b>(3) Renate</b>: <font color='#000080'>No. We are SO not.</font><br />
<b>(3) Renate</b>: <font color='#000080'>We are executing the getting the hell outta here maneuver.</font><br />
<b>(3) Renate</b>: <font color='#000080'>"Godfrey and I ran into their ground-dragon once, near Ktarr's Field. Scared me out of two years' growth," Renate says once they are clear of the dragons.</font><br />
<b>(1) Alan</b>: <font color='#000000'>The dragons have no interest in you, and Garland has gone for now, so you are in the clear.</font><br />
<b>(3) Renate</b>: <font color='#000080'>Good good. Let's go wherever we were going, then.</font><br />
<b>(4) Aryk</b>: <font color='#a40000'>Aryk would normally say something along the lines of "That explains things..." but says nothing.</font><br />
<b>(1) Alan</b>: <font color='#000000'>Well, the question now is "where are you going?" If you follow the river far enough, you'll run into a village where a ferryman can take you to the other side.</font><br />
<b>(3) Renate</b>: <font color='#000080'>What are ford markings like around these parts?</font><br />
<b>(1) Alan</b>: <font color='#000000'>He'd direct you to the baronial seat of Gerrington, one of the twelve provinces now called the Sages' Republic.</font><br />
<b>(3) Renate</b>: <font color='#000080'>But barring a ford, I think a ferry sounds like a fine idea.</font><br />
<b>(4) Aryk</b>: <font color='#a40000'>(They're heading there?  For what, I wonder...)</font><br />
<b>(3) Renate</b>: <font color='#000080'>"Wonder if Garland -- oh. Oh, no. That wasn't him, was it?"</font><br />
<b>(3) Renate</b>: <font color='#000080'>"No wonder you're silent, Aryk."</font><br />
<b>(1) Alan</b>: <font color='#000000'>Further gossip, served up free to travelers, would say that the barons of all twelve provinces are at the western town of Chapbrook for a war council. If you need a more endpoint kind of destination!</font><br />
<font color='#008000'>** (4) Aryk simply nods. **</font><br />
<b>(1) Alan</b>: <font color='#000000'>The weather ranges from gray and dry to gray and rainy, with only occasional bursts of sunshine.</font><br />
<b>(3) Renate</b>: <font color='#000080'>Well, we're also looking for a couple of specific people. Gossip heard of any of 'em?</font><br />
<b>(3) Renate</b>: <font color='#000080'>(Emily, Coris, Young Master Wrenfall)</font><br />
<b>(2) Rien</b>: <font color='#5e5b33'>(Or any combination thereof)</font><br />
<b>(1) Alan</b>: <font color='#000000'>Gossip is only moderately informative. Emily, nothing. Coris, head of an irregular unit that's cozy with Rainstone.</font><br />
<b>(1) Alan</b>: <font color='#000000'>The New Scourge has been shopping their services out to the southern dragon lords, fueling constant skirmishes down there.</font><br />
<b>(3) Renate</b>: <font color='#000080'>Oh. Damn.</font><br />
<b>(1) Alan</b>: <font color='#000000'>Word is the Blizzard King Margadas has established a contract they won't be tempted to break.</font><br />
<b>(3) Renate</b>: <font color='#000080'>Well, Coris will probably be at the all-baron shindig. Might as well head there and get the straight story.</font><br />
<b>(4) Aryk</b>: <font color='#a40000'>(Agreed.)</font><br />
<b>(1) Alan</b>: <font color='#000000'>These Patchwork Kingdoms are largely poor; on poor land, home to poor people. Renate can start to realize how well off the farmers of Karlbotel really are, on richer land, closer to lucrative markets; here, crops are lucky to break even.</font><br />
<b>(1) Alan</b>: <font color='#000000'>It's clear why the Sages' Republic was able to set up shop relatively unopposed: only the weaker dragons were pushed out to these lands, and they have little to pay armies with.</font><br />
<b>(1) Alan</b>: <font color='#000000'>But over a day or two, as you get closer to the southwestern towns, you can see elements of a fairly professional force on patrols and drills; they wear the "iron bull" of Midian Solaris.</font><br />
<b>(1) Alan</b>: <font color='#000000'>They're clearly peasant soldiers, but just as clearly, they take their duties seriously. Their squad commanders look more like career soldiers, with the scar and broken noses that are more common out here than in the Silver Coast or Andragar.</font><br />
<b>(1) Alan</b>: <font color='#000000'>(Gah, just realized I'm not logging this. Dorothea, are you?)</font><br />
<font color='#008000'>** (4) Aryk has been doing the uncharacteristically quiet thing, which is growing more and more characteristic day by day.  His mind is constantly locked on Emily and Garland. **</font><br />
<b>(1) Alan</b>: <font color='#000000'>(You're usually more conscientious than me anyway.)</font><br />
<b>(3) Renate</b>: <font color='#000080'>(Yes, I am.)</font><br />
<b>(3) Renate</b>: <font color='#000080'>(I still owe last week's logs, I think, though.)</font><br />
<b>(1) Alan</b>: <font color='#000000'>Near the end of the second day, you arrive at the walls of Chapbrook, a town which is not much more than a glorified motte and bailey, with a fortified two-story house occupying pride of place on the motte.</font><br />
<b>(3) Renate</b>: <font color='#000080'>(crap, except my logging seems not to be working)</font><br />
<b>(1) Alan</b>: <font color='#000000'>Despite the primitive defenses, it has apparently weathered frequent attacks, because the wood palisade shows signs of constant rebuilding, and most of the buildings outside the bailey show a much more temporary character than those within.</font><br />
<b>(1) Alan</b>: <font color='#000000'>(Oh well! I started anyway.)</font><br />
