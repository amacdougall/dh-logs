[Fri May 23 18:29:53 2008] : <b>(7954) Alan</b>: <font color='#000080'>So I'll just tell you what you learn in the first five minutes of the game:</font><br />

[Fri May 23 18:31:24 2008] : <b>(7954) Alan</b>: <font color='#000080'>So your character gains consciousness at the central intersection. Realizes pretty quickly that although thousands of people are pouring through it, none of them can see or hear him.</font><br />
[Fri May 23 18:31:28 2008] : <b>(7954) Alan</b>: <font color='#000080'>He gets a text message.</font><br />

[Fri May 23 18:33:20 2008] : <b>(7954) Alan</b>: <font color='#000080'>Beyond that? As it all unfolds, it all fits together perfectly, while still becoming amazingly cool.</font><br />
[Fri May 23 18:33:46 2008] : <b>(7954) Alan</b>: <font color='#000080'>They've put together a spectacular little game world, existing in a supernatural layer just out of phase with Shibuya -- the Underground.</font><br />
[Fri May 23 18:34:31 2008] : <b>(7961) Aryk</b>: <font color='#710000'>Sounds very cool.</font><br />
[Fri May 23 18:34:36 2008] : <b>(7954) Alan</b>: <font color='#000080'>It uses RPG concepts, but clothes them in real world style -- literally, in fact. Instead of armor, you wear clothes.

[Fri May 23 18:34:46 2008] : <b>(7961) Aryk</b>: <font color='#710000'>Unusual for Square to do something that sounds somewhat set in the present.</font><br />
[Fri May 23 18:34:53 2008] : <b>(7954) Alan</b>: <font color='#000080'>Clothes and powers have brands, and different brands are popular in different parts of the city -- kind of like using the ice sword in the fire dungeon, you know?</font><br />

[Fri May 23 18:35:13 2008] : <b>(7954) Alan</b>: <font color='#000080'>But you're also a trendsetter -- nobody can see you, but your actions influence the thoughts of the people in the real world.</font><br />
[Fri May 23 18:35:31 2008] : <b>(7954) Alan</b>: <font color='#000080'>So if you're doing well, the brands you have equipped grow in popularity, and become more powerful.</font><br />
[Fri May 23 18:35:44 2008] : <b>(7961) Aryk</b>: <font color='#710000'>But if nobody can see you, how can you have pointless conversations?  Is this an RPG or not?</font><br />
