[Fri Oct  6 23:07:53 2006] : <B>(5) Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>well, Adrian's the problem, I'm afraid -- he's got school.</font><br>

[Fri Oct  6 23:08:53 2006] : <B>(5) Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>right, which is Saturday night for us.</font><br>
[Fri Oct  6 23:08:55 2006] : <B>(1) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>Actually, Rien is really easy to write one-session side stories for.</font><br>
