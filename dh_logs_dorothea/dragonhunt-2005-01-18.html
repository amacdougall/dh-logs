[Tue Jan 18 14:09:16 2005] : <B>Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>Renate has spent entirely too much time in the bathroom, especially since it's barely five o'clock.</font><br>
[Tue Jan 18 14:10:39 2005] : <B>Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>She returned an hour ago from training with Lehron and plotting with Coris, and promptly disappeared, not to be seen again. Sounds of running water occasionally make themselves heard, but little else.</font><br>
[Tue Jan 18 14:12:14 2005] : <B>Aryk</B>: <font color='#000080'>Aryk, on the other hand, parted ways with everyone, and retrieved his things back in Angelwatch.  After some deliberation, he decided not to show up at the apartment.  Everything has a time and and place, and it wasn't yet time to risk meeting Rien.</font><br>
[Tue Jan 18 14:14:04 2005] : <B>Aryk</B>: <font color='#000080'>Instead, Aryk goes to Tifan's quite early, for lack of much else to do.  And, for the first time in his life, the thought of coffee appeals to him.</font><br>
[Tue Jan 18 14:14:09 2005] : <B>Aryk</B>: <font color='#000080'>And he's not even hung over.</font><br>
[Tue Jan 18 14:14:35 2005] : <B>Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>But even Renate -- especially Renate -- can only primp for so long. At five-fifteen she emerges, dressed in a short, simple scoop-necked dress in a disarming shade of soft azure, ribboned sandals on her feet.</font><br>
[Tue Jan 18 14:15:15 2005] : <B>Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>Her mother told her once that the best way to face a disagreeable social duty was to dress for it. Time to test that out.</font><br>
[Tue Jan 18 14:15:51 2005] : <B>Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>She had expected Aryk, planned to eat dinner with him, but he is not in evidence.</font><br>
[Tue Jan 18 14:16:22 2005] : <B>Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>She hasn't the heart to go to Carragio's on her own. Sylvie or Nora will feed her, she is sure of that, and Tifan's has a way of calming her.</font><br>
[Tue Jan 18 14:16:42 2005] : <B>Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>So despite the time, she locks her apartment behind her and hails a rickshaw.</font><br>
[Tue Jan 18 14:17:12 2005] : <B>Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>Aryk enters Tifan's before anything that could be called a dinner rush; he has his choice of tables.</font><br>
[Tue Jan 18 14:18:20 2005] : <B>Aryk</B>: <font color='#000080'>After a brief "hello" to Sylvie, Aryk chooses a round table near the bar and requests some gourmet coffee "that doesn't suck."</font><br>
[Tue Jan 18 14:18:34 2005] : <B>Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>Nora pokes her head out the door to the kitchen as he pushes his way through the door. "Heya, Sir Aryk! Congratulations!"</font><br>
[Tue Jan 18 14:18:45 2005] : <B>Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>"Coffee? Sure. You want a flavor shot?"</font><br>
[Tue Jan 18 14:19:15 2005] : <B>Aryk</B>: <font color='#000080'>"Thanks Nora.  I wouldn't have even known about it if it wasn't for you.  Er.... I don't know.  Will that make it taste better?"</font><br>
[Tue Jan 18 14:20:10 2005] : <B>Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>She tilts her red head to one side. "Somehow I'm getting the impression you're not in this for the full-bodied bean flavor experience."</font><br>
[Tue Jan 18 14:20:28 2005] : <B>Aryk</B>: <font color='#000080'>"It's made from beans?!"</font><br>
[Tue Jan 18 14:21:11 2005] : <B>Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>"Well... not <i>bean</i> beans. Coffee beans. I think the name's kind of a coincidence, but you'd have to ask somebody who knew. Not me, in other words."</font><br>
[Tue Jan 18 14:21:36 2005] : <B>Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>"We'll try a double latte with a shot of hazelnut. That's easy on the tastebuds."</font><br>
[Tue Jan 18 14:21:48 2005] : <B>Aryk</B>: <font color='#000080'>"Ah.  Okay.  I trust your judgement.  Whatever you think I'll like."</font><br>
[Tue Jan 18 14:22:27 2005] : <B>Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>She gets to work with a wood-and-metal contraption with lots of sticky-out bits that emits insane amounts of grinding and screeching noises for no readily apparent reason.</font><br>
[Tue Jan 18 14:22:43 2005] : <B>Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>"So, wow, your first slam and you place third! How cool is that?"</font><br>
[Tue Jan 18 14:23:27 2005] : <B>Aryk</B>: <font color='#000080'>"Yeah, I'm pretty fortunate.  Since I placed, I might still be able to line up a gig with Purgatory as the opening act."</font><br>
[Tue Jan 18 14:24:09 2005] : <B>Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>"No kidding! I hope you've been looking to travel. They go all over."</font><br>
[Tue Jan 18 14:24:40 2005] : <B>Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>"And seriously, level with me -- they didn't really hand you 'bunnies' as the word, did they?"</font><br>
[Tue Jan 18 14:25:19 2005] : <B>Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>She giggles, in a fashion that shows off considerable rippling cleavage.</font><br>
[Tue Jan 18 14:25:39 2005] : <B>Aryk</B>: <font color='#000080'>"I think it will be fun.  There's so many places I haven't seen.  It's a fantastic oppurtunity to spread the... my word.  And yeah.  Bunnies.  But I..."</font><br>
[Tue Jan 18 14:25:44 2005] : <B>Aryk</B>: <font color='#000080'>Aryk pauses.</font><br>
[Tue Jan 18 14:26:01 2005] : <B>Aryk</B>: <font color='#000080'>"Sorry.  What was I saying?"</font><br>
[Tue Jan 18 14:26:13 2005] : <B>Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>"Not much?"</font><br>
[Tue Jan 18 14:27:08 2005] : <B>Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>She puts an impressively tall mug in front of him. The hot liquid therein (topped with a pretty whipped-cream rosette) doesn't smell nearly as bitter as Aryk might have expected.</font><br>
[Tue Jan 18 14:27:46 2005] : <B>Aryk</B>: <font color='#000080'>"Yeah.  I guess not."  Aryk inspects it with his nose.  "People actually like this stuff?  It smells like a Karlbotel cattle farm."</font><br>
[Tue Jan 18 14:28:18 2005] : <font color='#008000'>** Aryk sips it warily **</font><br>
[Tue Jan 18 14:28:24 2005] : <B>Aryk</B>: <font color='#000080'>"Huh."</font><br>
[Tue Jan 18 14:28:42 2005] : <B>Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>"Don't look at me, sport. Can't stand it myself."</font><br>
[Tue Jan 18 14:29:05 2005] : <B>Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>"Or, on second thought, do look at me." She grins temptingly.</font><br>
[Tue Jan 18 14:29:13 2005] : <B>Aryk</B>: <font color='#000080'>"I guess I know what to order the next time I feel the need for a stiff drink."</font><br>
[Tue Jan 18 14:29:17 2005] : <B>Aryk</B>: <font color='#000080'>"Huh?"</font><br>
[Tue Jan 18 14:29:26 2005] : <font color='#008000'>** Aryk looks up with innocent eyes. **</font><br>
[Tue Jan 18 14:30:06 2005] : <B>Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>She leans over the bar. Aryk's view suddenly becomes considerably more interesting. "My favorite word. How'd you ever guess it?"</font><br>
[Tue Jan 18 14:30:39 2005] : <B>Aryk</B>: <font color='#000080'>"I think I just figured out why whenever I come here I always feel the need to leave such huge ti... tips."</font><br>
[Tue Jan 18 14:30:58 2005] : <B>Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>(sigh) Point for Aryk.</font><br>
[Tue Jan 18 14:31:10 2005] : <B>Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>(yay! do I feed 'em good straight lines or what?)</font><br>
[Tue Jan 18 14:31:19 2005] : <B>Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>He just keep racking them up.</font><br>
[Tue Jan 18 14:31:45 2005] : <B>Aryk</B>: <font color='#000080'>(WOOHOO!)</font><br>
[Tue Jan 18 14:31:45 2005] : <B>Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>Behind him, the door opens. Nora looks up, then straightens up. "Spoilsport," she murmurs, and then calls brightly, "Well, hello there, Lady Renate!"</font><br>
[Tue Jan 18 14:32:02 2005] : <B>Aryk</B>: <font color='#000080'>"Huh?  Rennie!"</font><br>
[Tue Jan 18 14:32:25 2005] : <B>Aryk</B>: <font color='#000080'>Aryk hops up.  "Ah damn.  We were gonna get some grub together weren't we?"</font><br>
[Tue Jan 18 14:32:49 2005] : <B>Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>"Hi, Aryk. Do I look all right? Hi to you too, Nora, and why are you calling me 'Lady' after I asked you not to?"</font><br>
[Tue Jan 18 14:33:05 2005] : <font color='#008000'>** Renate takes the stool next to Aryk. **</font><br>
[Tue Jan 18 14:33:30 2005] : <B>Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>"Well, there's still time if you want to go eat. But I think I'd rather just sit quietly and throw myself on Nora's mercy."</font><br>
[Tue Jan 18 14:33:53 2005] : <B>Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>Nora grins. "That's assuming I've got any."</font><br>
[Tue Jan 18 14:33:54 2005] : <B>Aryk</B>: <font color='#000080'>"Sorry, sis.  Yeah... er... I had the same thought just a moment ago."</font><br>
[Tue Jan 18 14:34:08 2005] : <font color='#008000'>** Aryk shivers ever so slightly. **</font><br>
[Tue Jan 18 14:34:38 2005] : <B>Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>Renate smiles faintly back. "I'll take my chances. Something I can't spill, please; this fabric stains horribly."</font><br>
[Tue Jan 18 14:34:50 2005] : <B>Aryk</B>: <font color='#000080'>"You look fantastic."</font><br>
[Tue Jan 18 14:35:13 2005] : <B>Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>"Thanks. We who are about to die or something at least want to look decent doing it."</font><br>
[Tue Jan 18 14:35:35 2005] : <B>Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>"Say, Nora? If Tifan's around and can spare me five minutes, I'd be grateful. No hurry."</font><br>
[Tue Jan 18 14:36:18 2005] : <B>Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>"I'll check," Nora says, and disappears into the kitchen.</font><br>
[Tue Jan 18 14:35:47 2005] : <font color='#008000'>** Aryk obviously dressed for the occasion too.  He's got his Hero Vest, headband, and zweihander back on.  He couldn't help it, he feels naked without them. **</font><br>
[Tue Jan 18 14:36:10 2005] : <B>Aryk</B>: <font color='#000080'>"Oh, don't be so dramatic."</font><br>
[Tue Jan 18 14:36:32 2005] : <B>Aryk</B>: <font color='#000080'>"It'll be fine.   Fine."  He reiterates with a slight tinge of doubt.</font><br>
[Tue Jan 18 14:37:53 2005] : <B>Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>She puts her hand on his. "I hope so. One way or another. Um, the stuff you were rhyming last night... I don't want to pry or anything, but you sounded about like I was sounding while I was still in my extremely-wigged stage."</font><br>
[Tue Jan 18 14:38:07 2005] : <B>Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>"Can I help? Even just listen?"</font><br>
[Tue Jan 18 14:38:35 2005] : <B>Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>"And, look, it's all right to say no."</font><br>
[Tue Jan 18 14:38:56 2005] : <B>Aryk</B>: <font color='#000080'>"Oh.  Oh, man.... it's so much to get into.  My head's like a whirlwind right now."</font><br>
[Tue Jan 18 14:39:15 2005] : <B>Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>"So pick a breeze and shoot it."</font><br>
[Tue Jan 18 14:39:51 2005] : <B>Aryk</B>: <font color='#000080'>"Okay, but you asked for it.  Damn, where do I start.  Well, first off, I haven't been to church in weeks."</font><br>
[Tue Jan 18 14:40:11 2005] : <B>Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>"Because...?"</font><br>
[Tue Jan 18 14:40:42 2005] : <B>Aryk</B>: <font color='#000080'>"I still pray... if anything... I pray more nowadays.  But... I haven't felt the need to have the church be some sort of intermediary between Michael and I."</font><br>
[Tue Jan 18 14:40:59 2005] : <B>Aryk</B>: <font color='#000080'>"I mean... I have Ricard, right?  But still, I can't help but feel guilty."</font><br>
[Tue Jan 18 14:41:59 2005] : <B>Aryk</B>: <font color='#000080'>"On that note, I have a lot of things I need to talk to Ricard about too... but I just can't muster up the guts to do it."</font><br>
[Tue Jan 18 14:42:27 2005] : <B>Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>"I don't entirely understand the whole paladin thing, Aryk, but my understanding (such as it is) is that a lot of them have to stay out of touch for a while. I don't think it's anything unusual."</font><br>
[Tue Jan 18 14:43:00 2005] : <B>Aryk</B>: <font color='#000080'>"I don't know.  I don't know any other paladins who stray like I have lately."</font><br>
[Tue Jan 18 14:43:20 2005] : <B>Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>"How do you think you've strayed?"</font><br>
[Tue Jan 18 14:45:02 2005] : <B>Aryk</B>: <font color='#000080'>"Well... having serious doubts.  I think I've worked through the whole 'the church is evil' thing.  You know, about how Raphaelites heal murders and all that crap.  I've realized... it's not the Angels to be angry at... it's the men and women who would take advantage of them."</font><br>
[Tue Jan 18 14:45:44 2005] : <B>Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>She nods silently.</font><br>
[Tue Jan 18 14:46:08 2005] : <B>Aryk</B>: <font color='#000080'>"And yet...  how can someone even think of using something so divine for such selfish reasons?  Does that make people like that my enemy too?  Or... or should I try to... you know... see the good in them, too?"</font><br>
[Tue Jan 18 14:47:14 2005] : <B>Aryk</B>: <font color='#000080'>"Will I ever have to kill a man with the exact same faith as my own?  What does that make me?"</font><br>
[Tue Jan 18 14:47:45 2005] : <font color='#008000'>** Aryk shakes his head and gulps down his coffee. **</font><br>
[Tue Jan 18 14:47:48 2005] : <B>Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>"You might. I can't give you any comfort on that point, Aryk."</font><br>
[Tue Jan 18 14:48:12 2005] : <B>Aryk</B>: <font color='#000080'>"No.... I guess not."</font><br>
[Tue Jan 18 14:48:11 2005] : <B>Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>"I never in my wildest dreams thought I'd have to kill a man who was begging me for mercy."</font><br>
[Tue Jan 18 14:48:30 2005] : <font color='#008000'>** Aryk nods silently. **</font><br>
[Tue Jan 18 14:48:29 2005] : <B>Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>"And if you'd asked me beforehand, I'd have said I wouldn't do it."</font><br>
[Tue Jan 18 14:49:42 2005] : <B>Aryk</B>: <font color='#000080'>"What about what Sadler J said yesterday?  About the..."  Aryk catches glimpse of Sylve wiping down a table and lowers his voice, "About the opposite of what I'm talking about now?  The good that evil does?"</font><br>
[Tue Jan 18 14:50:40 2005] : <B>Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>Renate scratches her ear. "I think it's good, irrespective of who does it."</font><br>
[Tue Jan 18 14:52:41 2005] : <B>Aryk</B>: <font color='#000080'>"Up until recently... I never even pondered that fact that good might do evil, and the other way around.  It really throws off my whole perspective, you know?  Ricard says I'm supposed to be not only a guardian, but a judge, and interpret the situation myself.  But then WHAT IN BLAZES.... what do I need the church for?"</font><br>
[Tue Jan 18 14:53:10 2005] : <B>Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>"Well... turn that around. One way to think about it is to ask yourself what would happen if all the really good people did as you're doing. Who would be left in the Church?"</font><br>
[Tue Jan 18 14:53:26 2005] : <B>Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>"And maybe you don't need the Church... but it needs you, and other people need it."</font><br>
[Tue Jan 18 14:54:09 2005] : <B>Aryk</B>: <font color='#000080'>"Huh... the church... might need me?  Wow... there's a concept.  All my life... I've needed them."</font><br>
[Tue Jan 18 14:54:28 2005] : <font color='#008000'>** Aryk sets down his coffee and rolls that one around in his brain. **</font><br>
[Tue Jan 18 14:54:55 2005] : <B>Aryk</B>: <font color='#000080'>"Now... now I've got you."</font><br>
[Tue Jan 18 14:55:09 2005] : <B>Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>"Oh, Aryk. I'm a weak reed at best, God knows."</font><br>
[Tue Jan 18 14:55:36 2005] : <B>Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>"Or I wouldn't be sitting here dressed within an inch of my life just to tell off an old friend."</font><br>
[Tue Jan 18 14:56:21 2005] : <B>Aryk</B>: <font color='#000080'>"Ah, hush.  You're the beam that supports me.  Without your guidance, and Ricard's... I'd be nowhere.  And you won't be doing any telling off at least until we've heard what he has to say."</font><br>
[Tue Jan 18 14:56:56 2005] : <B>Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>"Fair enough. Kick me if I slip."</font><br>
[Tue Jan 18 14:57:23 2005] : <B>Aryk</B>: <font color='#000080'>"Heh, okay.  Anyway, that's all just scratching the surface, sis."</font><br>
[Tue Jan 18 14:57:32 2005] : <B>Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>"All right. So what's deeper?"</font><br>
[Tue Jan 18 14:57:38 2005] : <B>Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>"You haven't scared me yet."</font><br>
[Tue Jan 18 14:58:39 2005] : <B>Aryk</B>: <font color='#000080'>Aryk smiles.  "Well... let's see... I don't have to get into with you about the whole dragon tyranny thing.  We know how we stand on that one.  Well.. then there's..."</font><br>
[Tue Jan 18 14:58:45 2005] : <B>Aryk</B>: <font color='#000080'>"Then there's Emily."</font><br>
[Tue Jan 18 14:59:22 2005] : <B>Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>"What about her?" Renate encourages him softly.</font><br>
[Tue Jan 18 14:59:40 2005] : <B>Aryk</B>: <font color='#000080'>"I know we've talked about this before... but.... what if she's... what if she's one of those people... you know... the bad ones who do good things?"</font><br>
[Tue Jan 18 15:00:28 2005] : <B>Aryk</B>: <font color='#000080'>"I couldn't live with that.  I love her."</font><br>
[Tue Jan 18 15:00:48 2005] : <B>Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>(Aww.)</font><br>
[Tue Jan 18 15:00:58 2005] : <B>Aryk</B>: <font color='#000080'>"Shit.... what if Garland Stahl is one of those people?!"</font><br>
[Tue Jan 18 15:01:07 2005] : <B>Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>"Do you love her enough to try to redeem her?"</font><br>
[Tue Jan 18 15:01:40 2005] : <B>Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>"Be an example for her?"</font><br>
[Tue Jan 18 15:01:56 2005] : <B>Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>"Forgive her when she fails?"</font><br>
[Tue Jan 18 15:02:57 2005] : <B>Aryk</B>: <font color='#000080'>"Sure.  If she'd let me.  She doesn't strike me as the type to change her point of view so easily.  She's the most determined person I've ever known.  Determined to what... your guess is as good as mine."</font><br>
[Tue Jan 18 15:03:25 2005] : <B>Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>"Is it her point of view or her actions that matter?"</font><br>
[Tue Jan 18 15:03:42 2005] : <B>Aryk</B>: <font color='#000080'>"I don't know.  Both, I guess."</font><br>
[Tue Jan 18 15:04:14 2005] : <B>Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>"Equally?"</font><br>
[Tue Jan 18 15:04:38 2005] : <B>Aryk</B>: <font color='#000080'>"Well yeah.  Practice what you preach, you know?"</font><br>
[Tue Jan 18 15:04:46 2005] : <B>Aryk</B>: <font color='#000080'>"Live true."</font><br>

[Tue Jan 18 15:06:55 2005] : <B>Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>"Um, let me try to get at this another way. There's rules to poetry, right? I was taught some of them when I was a kid."</font><br>

[Tue Jan 18 15:08:26 2005] : <B>Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>"The goal being a good poem, not necessarily following all the rules all the time. Right?"</font><br>
[Tue Jan 18 15:08:40 2005] : <B>Aryk</B>: <font color='#000080'>"Sure.  Okay."</font><br>
[Tue Jan 18 15:09:52 2005] : <B>Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>"I think maybe it's the same thing. The Church has rules, and it has them for a reason, and it's worth it to study the rules and the reason they exist. But the rules aren't the goal. A good world, that's the goal. And the rules by themselves won't get us there, I don't think."</font><br>

[Tue Jan 18 15:13:08 2005] : <B>Aryk</B>: <font color='#000080'>"I hear you.  But... I've learned there are those that don't care about the goal... they just want the rewards.  The Raphaelites who heal for money.  The Gabrielite assassins who fulfill contracts for personal gain.  Urielite necromancers, for Michael's sake!  I mean, there is something totally not divine about necromancy, I don't care how you look at it."</font><br>
[Tue Jan 18 15:14:09 2005] : <B>Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>She nods. "You're right. Means your personal set of rules don't always match up with the Church's. I kind of suspect most Churchfolk can say that, actually."</font><br>
[Tue Jan 18 15:14:22 2005] : <B>Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>"But rules change, you know, Aryk. When people care enough to change them."</font><br>

[Tue Jan 18 15:16:30 2005] : <B>Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>"And explained why it's important to you?"</font><br>
[Tue Jan 18 15:17:31 2005] : <B>Aryk</B>: <font color='#000080'>"More or less.  She just tells me that when she's ready... or maybe I'm ready, she'll tell me.  Maybe... maybe I haven't stressed how important it is for me to know, though.  Next time I see her... whenever in blazes that is, I will."</font><br>

[Tue Jan 18 15:24:53 2005] : <B>Aryk</B>: <font color='#000080'>"I guess that's it.  Whenever I try to get everything off my chest, there's always so much of it that I forget half of what I meant to talk about.  But... thank you, Rennie.  You have helped clear some things up."  He puts his and on hers.</font><br>

[Tue Jan 18 15:26:39 2005] : <B>Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>"Um, elementary tactics. Violence is the last resort, not the first. Did you try talking to Dorothy before you attacked her?"</font><br>
[Tue Jan 18 15:27:55 2005] : <B>Aryk</B>: <font color='#000080'>"No.  I was afraid if I let her talk she'd cast some weird spell on all of us.  So I sort of ambushed her and tackled her on the ground off her horse, and then I like planted my forearm over her face so she couldn't make any noise until Emily could gag her.  Then we pretty much did all the talking."</font><br>
[Tue Jan 18 15:28:26 2005] : <B>Aryk</B>: <font color='#000080'>"Emily seemed convinced she was a threat, and at the time I had no other reason to think otherwise."</font><br>

[Tue Jan 18 15:30:01 2005] : <B>Aryk</B>: <font color='#000080'>"Not exactly.  It was stupid.  But... I guess I pictured her to be some sort of evil menace.  But, instantly, when I saw her on the ground there, I regretted it.  I'm no saint, I know that clear as day.  But... I want to be better."</font><br>
[Tue Jan 18 15:30:41 2005] : <B>Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>"Hey. I'm not beating on you. Really. I'm just saying that sometimes giving people a chance to do the right thing before you pound on them saves a lot of pounding. You know what I'm saying?"</font><br>
[Tue Jan 18 15:32:06 2005] : <B>Aryk</B>: <font color='#000080'>"Yeah, I really do.  I was only afraid she'd do something awful if we didn't.  I guess... well... I hate to keep saying it... but I guess I should have given her the chance to proove their was good in her too, first.  I'm... still working on this whole 'the world is not divided solely between good and evil' thing, you know?"</font><br>

[Tue Jan 18 16:59:14 2005] : <B>Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>"Just understanding? Just forgiveness? Or more?"</font><br>

Aryk is right about me, I do despise my father, and one day I will see him dead.  But he is the only one I want dead.  I do not wish to see <i>you</i> dead, Renate, ever, and would gladly fight to my own death to prevent yours.  The same goes for Aryk, which is why I interfered in his fight during that whole Ruido Grande thing."</font><br>

You and I can't take.... him... down by ourselves.  With my lyrics, and hopefully with my album, I want to organize an uprise.  I want to cast the pebble that starts the avalanche.  But ultimately, the three of us are going to be the ones who draw swords against our supposed masters.  The three of us.  Together, we can accomplish so much more."</font><br>
[Tue Jan 18 17:08:07 2005] : <font color='#008000'>** Renate sits still as stone, considering, Rien and Aryk's words washing over her like waves. Are they wearing her resistance away? Hard to tell, she sits so still. **</font><br>

I've made some terrible mistakes in my time, but the biggest one was not trusting you totally, as I should have done.  You are the love of my heart, Renate, and the thought of what I have done to you and what you nearly did in response breaks my heart."</font><br>
[Tue Jan 18 17:11:31 2005] : <font color='#008000'>** Aryk doesn't know what to say.  He decides it's best not to say anything.  He reaches across the table and puts his hand on Rien's shoulder. **</font><br>
