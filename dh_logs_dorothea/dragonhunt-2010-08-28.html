[Sat Aug 28 21:15:31 2010] : <b>(1586) Alan</b>: <font color='#3d0079'>Want to take any of them alive?</font><br />
[Sat Aug 28 21:16:27 2010] : <b>(1568) Rien</b>: <font color='#263607'>(If we did, how would we hold them?)</font><br />
[Sat Aug 28 21:16:28 2010] : <b>(1586) Alan</b>: <font color='#3d0079'>In the end, two Longrangers are wounded, only one seriously, and no deaths. The Margolin unit arrives just as things are settling down.</font><br />
[Sat Aug 28 21:16:39 2010] : <b>(1569) Aryk</b>: <font color='#800000'>Once the fighting starts windi.ng down, Aryk will Fire Emblem one in the leg.</font><br />
[Sat Aug 28 21:16:52 2010] : <b>(1565) Renate</b>: <font color='#000080'>Yes, we should take prisoners.</font><br />
[Sat Aug 28 21:17:00 2010] : <b>(1565) Renate</b>: <font color='#000080'>This situation isn't as desperate as the one in Kentfield.</font><br />
[Sat Aug 28 21:17:20 2010] : <b>(1565) Renate</b>: <font color='#000080'>Aaaaaand we need the intel, damn it. Necromancer Boy is still out there.</font><br />
[Sat Aug 28 21:17:24 2010] : <b>(1565) Renate</b>: <font color='#000080'>So is Heliomere.</font><br />
[Sat Aug 28 21:17:39 2010] : <b>(1569) Aryk</b>: <font color='#800000'>I guess if it comes to it we can tie some up and just leave them here.</font><br />
[Sat Aug 28 21:18:20 2010] : <b>(1565) Renate</b>: <font color='#000080'>I'm afraid we need to burn bodies, though, because of Necromancer Boy.</font><br />
[Sat Aug 28 21:18:27 2010] : <b>(1586) Alan</b>: <font color='#3d0079'>Well, you'll have to subdue them. They refuse to stop fighting; if you offer them terms, they don't believe you. They're pretty desperate at this point.</font><br />
[Sat Aug 28 21:18:41 2010] : <b>(1565) Renate</b>: <font color='#000080'>Fine. I expect we can manage that.</font><br />
[Sat Aug 28 21:18:55 2010] : <b>(1565) Renate</b>: <font color='#000080'>If a few of them die, oh well.</font><br />
[Sat Aug 28 21:19:24 2010] : <b>(1569) Aryk</b>: <font color='#800000'>Well, Aryk only leaves the one alive.  Renate made it clear prisons are out of the question.</font><br />
[Sat Aug 28 21:19:35 2010] : <b>(1586) Alan</b>: <font color='#3d0079'>All right. Let's leave it at that guy, then.</font><br />
[Sat Aug 28 21:20:35 2010] : <b>(1565) Renate</b>: <font color='#000080'>Fine.</font><br />
[Sat Aug 28 21:21:10 2010] : <b>(1586) Alan</b>: <font color='#3d0079'>After you've disarmed and restrained him, he slumps in despair. "Whatever. Just kill that shithead Artonin, too. He told us to wait here while he went ahead and dispelled some more druid magic. Looks like he could tell you were coming and left us to cover his ass."</font><br />

[Sat Aug 28 21:23:08 2010] : <b>(1586) Alan</b>: <font color='#3d0079'>"We were going to Brosford to meet up with Leon. Maybe Artonin's gonna go there, say he was the only one who made it out. You want him, that's where I'd look."</font><br />
[Sat Aug 28 21:23:32 2010] : <b>(1568) Rien</b>: <font color='#263607'>Rien closes his eyes, then opens them again to reveal their blazing white incandesence.  He hunts around with his power, looking for any signs of the mage.</font><br />
[Sat Aug 28 21:24:29 2010] : <b>(1586) Alan</b>: <font color='#3d0079'>"Brosford's a town a ways up north and east from Birch Creek... kind of a rowdy place, a neutral ground for outlaws and mercs," Burress says. "Not surprised these gents use it as a rendezvous."</font><br />
[Sat Aug 28 21:25:01 2010] : <b>(1586) Alan</b>: <font color='#3d0079'>Nope... this Artonin is either not using any magic right now, or he's outside Rien's detection range.</font><br />
[Sat Aug 28 21:25:23 2010] : <b>(1569) Aryk</b>: <font color='#800000'>Aryk turns.  "Sergeant Grant, have some of your men stay behind and burn the bodies.  Everyone else, mount up."</font><br />
[Sat Aug 28 21:25:30 2010] : <b>(1586) Alan</b>: <font color='#3d0079'>Renate doesn't sense anyone (unaccounted for) within a quarter of a kilometer either.</font><br />
[Sat Aug 28 21:25:49 2010] : <b>(1565) Renate</b>: <font color='#000080'>"I can't find anyone either," Renate murmurs. "I suppose there's no pattern to the burning? Can we follow the ley lines?"</font><br />

[Sat Aug 28 21:27:23 2010] : <b>(1568) Rien</b>: <font color='#263607'>Can Rien feel any ley lines where the power isn't flowing because it's blocked upstream?</font><br />
[Sat Aug 28 21:27:40 2010] : <b>(1586) Alan</b>: <font color='#3d0079'>You'd have to get within a few meters of a ley line to detect that.</font><br />
[Sat Aug 28 21:28:18 2010] : <b>(1586) Alan</b>: <font color='#3d0079'>Let's handle it next session; I guess you have a wedding to go to, and it seems like a natural breaking point anyway. You can either chase down your mage friend, or return to town and move on with life.</font><br />
[Sat Aug 28 21:28:22 2010] : <b>(1568) Rien</b>: <font color='#263607'>Well, if he can feel where they are, he can at least go across them</font><br />
[Sat Aug 28 21:28:26 2010] : <b>(1586) Alan</b>: <font color='#3d0079'>You at least wiped out the main force of the bandits.</font><br />
[Sat Aug 28 21:28:46 2010] : <b>(1569) Aryk</b>: <font color='#800000'>Oh, we're going to Brosford.  Some of us, anyway.</font><br />
[Sat Aug 28 21:29:12 2010] : <b>(1565) Renate</b>: <font color='#000080'>Agreed. I don't like the idea of psycho necromancers running around free.</font><br />
[Sat Aug 28 21:29:33 2010] : <b>(1565) Renate</b>: <font color='#000080'>And he'll just be harder to kill if he puts together another merc force.</font><br />
[Sat Aug 28 21:29:40 2010] : <b>(1569) Aryk</b>: <font color='#800000'>And it should piss Heliomere right off if we bag and tag him.</font><br />
[Sat Aug 28 21:29:43 2010] : <b>(1586) Alan</b>: <font color='#3d0079'>Handily, I might add. That mud thing, now that I think about it, is really powerful. I'm going to say that since you have to vibrate the earth into loose dirt AND create water in it, it takes long enough that people can move off the ground before it becomes sticky. They have to use up their movement to do that, of course.</font><br />
[Sat Aug 28 21:30:05 2010] : <b>(1565) Renate</b>: <font color='#000080'>Well, they were tanks.</font><br />
[Sat Aug 28 21:30:07 2010] : <b>(1586) Alan</b>: <font color='#3d0079'>So people can feel the earth getting unstable, and can decide what to do about it.</font><br />
[Sat Aug 28 21:30:12 2010] : <b>(1565) Renate</b>: <font color='#000080'>With people like Renate, that wouldn't work so well.</font><br />
[Sat Aug 28 21:30:27 2010] : <b>(1586) Alan</b>: <font color='#3d0079'>Right, I'm not saying that what happened was wrong.</font><br />
[Sat Aug 28 21:30:42 2010] : <b>(1569) Aryk</b>: <font color='#800000'>That's just because she would start jumping on people's heads.</font><br />
[Sat Aug 28 21:31:29 2010] : <b>(1586) Alan</b>: <font color='#3d0079'>Okay, so, we'll handle the tracking/Brosford/etc next session. Which should give you some hints of what Heliomere's up to.</font><br />
[Sat Aug 28 21:31:43 2010] : <b>(1569) Aryk</b>: <font color='#800000'>I gotta split.  That was fun.  Looking forward to next session.</font><br />
[Sat Aug 28 21:31:53 2010] : <b>(1569) Aryk</b>: <font color='#800000'>Oh, shit. Yeah.</font><br />

[Sat Aug 28 21:32:38 2010] : <b>(1569) Aryk</b>: <font color='#800000'>If you want to tackle this thing, just play without me.  NPC me.</font><br />
[Sat Aug 28 21:32:49 2010] : <b>(1565) Renate</b>: <font color='#000080'>We can probably do that.</font><br />
[Sat Aug 28 21:33:06 2010] : <b>(1569) Aryk</b>: <font color='#800000'>This playing on Saturday thing is really messing up our game.  But what other choice do we have?</font><br />
[Sat Aug 28 21:33:32 2010] : <b>(1565) Renate</b>: <font color='#000080'>Right now, not much. We'll make do.</font><br />
[Sat Aug 28 21:33:34 2010] : <b>(1568) Rien</b>: <font color='#263607'>None, at the moment</font><br />
[Sat Aug 28 21:34:02 2010] : <b>(1569) Aryk</b>: <font color='#800000'>Yeah.  Sorry, guys.  It's not one I should blow off.</font><br />
