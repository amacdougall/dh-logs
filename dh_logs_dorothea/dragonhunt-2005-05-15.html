[Sun May 15 18:05:34 2005] : <B>Tancred</B>: <font color='#000080'>Pointless waste of time. The greats always steal.</font><br>
[Sun May 15 18:05:49 2005] : <B>Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>Someone called Renate, in World of Warcraft, "Rennie." I suggested "Wren."</font><br>
[Sun May 15 18:05:54 2005] : <B>Tancred</B>: <font color='#000080'>:)</font><br>
[Sun May 15 18:05:58 2005] : <B>Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>Then she asked what my horse was named.</font><br>
[Sun May 15 18:06:16 2005] : <B>Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>I'd never thought about it, but yep, horses probably do have to have names, don't they?</font><br>
[Sun May 15 18:06:31 2005] : <B>Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>Her horse was named Satya. So much more educated.</font><br>
[Sun May 15 18:06:41 2005] : <B>Tancred</B>: <font color='#000080'>yes, horses generally do have names</font><br>
[Sun May 15 18:06:49 2005] : <B>Tancred</B>: <font color='#000080'>generally so you can yell at them better</font><br>
[Sun May 15 18:07:08 2005] : <B>Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>So I just used "Will-o-the-Wisp."</font><br>
[Sun May 15 18:07:28 2005] : <B>Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>At least I'm keeping up with the in-combat drunkenness.</font><br>
[Sun May 15 18:07:28 2005] : <B>Sashi</B>: <font color='#004040'>lol</font><br>
[Sun May 15 18:08:05 2005] : <B>Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>It makes it hard when I'm sneaking up on an enemy and wobbling back and forth, but hey. Fun's fun.</font><br>
[Sun May 15 18:08:27 2005] : <B>Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>So I'm thinking we should do Renate's conversation with Darm first, since you'll want time to think about it.</font><br>
[Sun May 15 18:08:31 2005] : <B>Tancred</B>: <font color='#000080'>In a fluff piece I wrote, I assumed that all the von Adler horseflesh was named after bugs... therefore Luna Moth, Dragonfly, Ladybug, etc.</font><br>
[Sun May 15 18:08:36 2005] : <B>Tancred</B>: <font color='#000080'>But I ended up editing that part out.</font><br>

[Sun May 15 18:08:48 2005] : <B>Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>Sounds a bit more like a superhero group anyway.</font><br>
[Sun May 15 18:08:59 2005] : <B>Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>I was hoping to chat with Coris about it, but if she has to do it cold, okay.</font><br>
[Sun May 15 18:09:14 2005] : <B>Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>Oh, and I have to make rollcall at a guild meeting at 7, but I'm going to just go there and tab out.</font><br>
[Sun May 15 18:09:18 2005] : <B>Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>okay</font><br>
[Sun May 15 18:09:20 2005] : <B>Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>So gaming should be relatively uninterrupted.</font><br>
[Sun May 15 18:09:27 2005] : <B>Sashi</B>: <font color='#004040'>yay for walking so much your feet bleed</font><br>
[Sun May 15 18:09:35 2005] : <B>Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>hon, you need new shoes</font><br>
[Sun May 15 18:09:55 2005] : <B>Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>And we can wait on the Darm thing, or heck, get coaching first and then go with Rien. I doubt Darm would refuse Rien's presence.</font><br>
[Sun May 15 18:09:58 2005] : <B>Sashi</B>: <font color='#004040'>probably</font><br>
[Sun May 15 18:10:02 2005] : <B>Sashi</B>: <font color='#004040'>but i couldn't much care</font><br>
[Sun May 15 18:10:04 2005] : <B>Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>As far as Darm's concerned, Rien's still the prince.</font><br>
[Sun May 15 18:10:12 2005] : <B>Sashi</B>: <font color='#004040'>today I am not walking at all if I can avoid it</font><br>
[Sun May 15 18:10:14 2005] : <B>Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>I'll go for plus coaching, minus Rien. :)</font><br>
[Sun May 15 18:10:38 2005] : <B>Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>Darm's enough of a handful. Darm plus Rien is more than she especially wants to deal with. Especially since... well, you'll see.</font><br>
[Sun May 15 18:11:00 2005] : <B>Sashi</B>: <font color='#004040'>my dad's watching monday morning children's cartoons</font><br>

[Sun May 15 18:11:08 2005] : <B>Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>Part of Darm's near-future trouble is that he assumes you're doing what Coris signed on to do: guarantee the success fo the tour.</font><br>
[Sun May 15 18:11:19 2005] : <B>Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>heh heh heh</font><br>
[Sun May 15 18:11:24 2005] : <B>Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>security != success</font><br>
[Sun May 15 18:11:26 2005] : <B>Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>I suspect you have wildly different definitions of "success."</font><br>
[Sun May 15 18:11:34 2005] : <B>Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>that too</font><br>
[Sun May 15 18:11:54 2005] : <B>Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>And part of your long-term trouble will be his reaction to your ploy and possibly the results of the upcoming conversation.</font><br>
[Sun May 15 18:12:04 2005] : <B>Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>but he can be forgiven for assuming that she's a Purgatory fan</font><br>
[Sun May 15 18:12:07 2005] : <B>Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>she used to be, after all</font><br>
[Sun May 15 18:12:16 2005] : <B>Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>yeah, he's not gonna be pleased, if it works out</font><br>
[Sun May 15 18:12:31 2005] : <B>Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>But you've been planning to get Heaven as active enemies for a long time now, so I doubt it'll throw any more of a wrench in.</font><br>
[Sun May 15 18:12:51 2005] : <B>Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>eh, I don't know about *planning* on that... more like assuming it was gonna happen no matter what I did</font><br>
[Sun May 15 18:13:02 2005] : <B>Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>I actually have an interesting ploy planned for Lyria, a bit later on.</font><br>
[Sun May 15 18:13:19 2005] : <B>Sashi</B>: <font color='#004040'>oh, and on the subject of Lyria</font><br>
[Sun May 15 18:13:22 2005] : <B>Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>yes?</font><br>
[Sun May 15 18:13:36 2005] : <B>Sashi</B>: <font color='#004040'>I've talked ot you about this already D</font><br>
[Sun May 15 18:13:44 2005] : <B>Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>sure you shouldn't IM it?</font><br>
[Sun May 15 18:14:03 2005] : <B>Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>Best to keep secrets away from me at this point.</font><br>
[Sun May 15 18:14:12 2005] : <B>Sashi</B>: <font color='#004040'>no, no secrets</font><br>
[Sun May 15 18:14:19 2005] : <B>Sashi</B>: <font color='#004040'>and I've gotta ask you this anyway Alan</font><br>
[Sun May 15 18:14:22 2005] : <B>Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>Mishandling of the Heaven situation will result in Renate's head and body being buried in separate high-security vaults.</font><br>
[Sun May 15 18:14:43 2005] : <B>Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>Joy.</font><br>
[Sun May 15 18:14:47 2005] : <B>Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>It would have to be severely botched, of course.</font><br>
[Sun May 15 18:15:06 2005] : <B>Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>But "botching" can include underestimation of what they can get away with.</font><br>
[Sun May 15 18:15:24 2005] : <B>Sashi</B>: <font color='#004040'>Alan: would it be possible that Rien can find Lyria's little place on the planes and take Renate there, to save Lyria the power of corporeating on the PMP?</font><br>
[Sun May 15 18:15:32 2005] : <B>Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>That's as much DM warning as I can give. :\</font><br>
[Sun May 15 18:16:03 2005] : <B>Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>If you give them reason to decide you're better off neutralized, have strong allies ... ones without political reasons to sacrifice you in the name of peace.</font><br>
[Sun May 15 18:16:27 2005] : <B>Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>Yes, Adrian, I believe so. Particularly if Lyria showed him the way.</font><br>
[Sun May 15 18:16:34 2005] : <B>Sashi</B>: <font color='#004040'>good</font><br>
[Sun May 15 18:16:52 2005] : <B>Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>Well, why do you THINK she's been working so hard to keep a low profile?</font><br>
[Sun May 15 18:17:19 2005] : <B>Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>Right now, all they can really think is "do-gooder, antagonizes dragons, not too bright" which is just fine with her.</font><br>
[Sun May 15 18:17:51 2005] : <B>Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>Anyway. You may turn the log on whenever you please.</font><br>
[Sun May 15 18:18:07 2005] : <B>Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>Right, I'm not saying you can't walk that narrow line.</font><br>
[Sun May 15 18:18:10 2005] : <B>Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>You've done a great job so far.</font><br>
[Sun May 15 18:18:33 2005] : <B>Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>The stakes are going to get higher than they've ever been, though.</font><br>
[Sun May 15 18:18:38 2005] : <B>Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>I doubt it not.</font><br>
[Sun May 15 18:18:42 2005] : <B>Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>Okay, Sashi, are you switching over to Rien?</font><br>
[Sun May 15 18:18:50 2005] : <B>Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>Or do we want to do that at all right now?</font><br>
[Sun May 15 18:18:53 2005] : <B>Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>Sure, let's do it.</font><br>
[Sun May 15 18:19:20 2005] : <B>Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>"Darm wants to talk to you alone? Huh," Coris says, pacing.</font><br>
[Sun May 15 18:19:35 2005] : <B>Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>"We'd better check with all the florists and chocolatiers. Maybe he has a crush."</font><br>
[Sun May 15 18:19:53 2005] : <B>Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>"Mm-hm. You may add remarks about the plot thickening. Well, come to that, I <i>was</i> planning to wear my orange dress."</font><br>
[Sun May 15 18:19:59 2005] : <B>Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>"Can't hurt to keep him sweet."</font><br>
[Sun May 15 18:20:07 2005] : <B>Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>"Besides, he gets thrown off by formality."</font><br>
[Sun May 15 18:20:14 2005] : <B>Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>"It is a very nice dress. And yes, he always has."</font><br>
[Sun May 15 18:20:37 2005] : <B>Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>"Anything that keeps him off-balance helps me. Anyway, you were asking how my brother got tied up in all this?"</font><br>
[Sun May 15 18:20:39 2005] : <B>Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>"He told me he still feels like a back-country boy most of the time. I guess nobody outlives their upbringing."</font><br>
[Sun May 15 18:21:19 2005] : <B>Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>"Yes... or no. I know exactly why good people get attracted to Andragar."</font><br>
[Sun May 15 18:21:49 2005] : <B>Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>"The promise of power is a great catalyst for belief in their social plans."</font><br>
[Sun May 15 18:22:16 2005] : <B>Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>"Is he their new Arc Knight? I haven't been in the loop."</font><br>
[Sun May 15 18:22:17 2005] : <B>Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>"Eh. I've become all but convinced that power is a positive <em>barrier</em> to social plans. Ones that are actually social, at any rate."</font><br>
[Sun May 15 18:22:42 2005] : <B>Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>"Societal plans, then."</font><br>
[Sun May 15 18:23:08 2005] : <B>Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>"There is definitely a distinction. Seems to be lost on many, though. Let me tell you the story."</font><br>
[Sun May 15 18:23:33 2005] : <B>Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>"When we took on the Big Noise, we sent Rien to Atlantis to ask for help from the Lan'yarian consul."</font><br>

[Sun May 15 18:25:15 2005] : <B>Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>"So he gave the Atlantis Watch a false description, to protect me. And came home and kept quiet about it for a few days. Then he told me."</font><br>
[Sun May 15 18:26:35 2005] : <B>Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>Coris sits down. "So what's your reaction to that?"</font><br>
[Sun May 15 18:26:48 2005] : <B>Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>"Well, what <em>could</em> I do? This was just after Darrenfold, so fortunately I could go directly to Noble Sapphire without six layers of bureaucracy in the way."</font><br>
[Sun May 15 18:27:09 2005] : <B>Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>"To tell him?"</font><br>

[Sun May 15 19:20:00 2005] : <B>Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>She sighs. "These stories do get garbled, over time. It doesn't necessarily even take much time. Emilia Eaglebourne only took a day."</font><br>

[Sun May 15 19:21:51 2005] : <B>Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>"She's a story concocted by a butler to put an untried sixteen-year-old girl in an arena with a dragon. That's all she ever was. You take my point, I hope."</font><br>
[Sun May 15 19:22:38 2005] : <B>Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>"Understood. When the 'fiery sword' in question turns out to be a tuning fork, we will all have a good laugh."</font><br>

[Sun May 15 19:27:51 2005] : <B>Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>"Absolutely. At the risk of sounding like a politician, it's been a diverse and vibrant community filled with friendly people."</font><br>

[Sun May 15 20:18:18 2005] : <B>Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>As for further offscreen things: Renate will tell Coris all about it, of course, and advance her two possibilities: that Darm is courting Whirlwind Lionheart for some reason, and that Darm is checking up on her.</font><br>

[Sun May 15 20:18:40 2005] : <B>Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>Since Shaleberg knows the whole story of her little Mists expedition.</font><br>
[Sun May 15 20:19:13 2005] : <B>Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>She'll also ask if he (or Masan Ahim) can get a message to Soleil, along the lines of "Heaven is trying to block your recruitment efforts. Love and kisses, Renate von Adler."</font><br>

[Sun May 15 20:20:11 2005] : <B>Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>He found that out just by asking some street vendors in the area.</font><br>
