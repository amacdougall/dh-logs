[Fri Jul 30 17:59:03 2004] : <B>Rien</B>: <font color='#804040'>let me try something </font><br>
[Fri Jul 30 17:59:05 2004] : <B>Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>It would make sense if an MDI came into existence when you're connected to two things.</font><br>

[Fri Jul 30 18:00:51 2004] : <B>Rien</B>: <font color='#804040'>must have turned it on without thinking</font><br>
[Fri Jul 30 18:01:43 2004] : <B>Dorothea</B>: <font color='#000080'>cleverness!</font><br>
[Fri Jul 30 18:03:42 2004] : <B>Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>By the way, it's probably easier to do your conversation with Whirlwind Lionheart offscreen, in summary&#8212;the information he's willing to share is pretty sparse.</font><br>
[Fri Jul 30 18:03:51 2004] : <B>Dorothea</B>: <font color='#000080'>okay</font><br>
[Fri Jul 30 18:04:01 2004] : <B>Rien</B>: <font color='#804040'>funky</font><br>
[Fri Jul 30 18:04:19 2004] : <B>Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>He's not letting anything slip about Rien's third personality. All he says is that it "sleeps, bound in adamant chains."</font><br>
[Fri Jul 30 18:04:35 2004] : <B>Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>And winkingly implies that if it wakes up, you'll know.</font><br>
[Fri Jul 30 18:05:15 2004] : <B>Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>The information he's giving you for free is&#8212;giant shock&#8212;Rien is older than he remembers.</font><br>
[Fri Jul 30 18:05:23 2004] : <B>Rien</B>: <font color='#804040'>we could scene it like this: rien uses the thingy which summons Mr. Lionheart's servant, takes hm to Forfeit Isle, and we leave the scene with Reante, in the real world, few minutes later back he comes, with lsightly more knowledge than he left with.</font><br>
[Fri Jul 30 18:05:44 2004] : <B>Rien</B>: <font color='#804040'>is he older than he remembers or older than he remembers bewing told he is?</font><br>
[Fri Jul 30 18:06:02 2004] : <B>Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>Excellent question. Whirlwind Lionheart freely admits that he doesn't know.</font><br>
[Fri Jul 30 18:06:14 2004] : <B>Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>It's at least the latter; possibly the former.</font><br>
[Fri Jul 30 18:06:27 2004] : <B>Dorothea</B>: <font color='#000080'>and the price for this tiny nugget of information is...?</font><br>
[Fri Jul 30 18:06:33 2004] : <B>Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>After all, Trancey seems to "remember" things from hundreds of years ago, at least.</font><br>
[Fri Jul 30 18:06:40 2004] : <B>Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>That nugget is a freebie.</font><br>
[Fri Jul 30 18:07:26 2004] : <B>Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>Whirlwind Lionheart says he's willing to provide up to three pieces of guidance, one building on the next, as to Rien's past and true nature...</font><br>
[Fri Jul 30 18:07:35 2004] : <B>Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>...again, in exchange for an indefinite favor.</font><br>
[Fri Jul 30 18:07:43 2004] : <B>Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>Again, something Rien "wants to do."</font><br>
[Fri Jul 30 18:07:45 2004] : <B>Dorothea</B>: <font color='#000080'>grrrrrrrrrrrrrrr...</font><br>
[Fri Jul 30 18:07:56 2004] : <font color='#0000ff'>Aryk (enter): 18:07</font><br>
[Fri Jul 30 18:08:13 2004] : <font color='#0000ff'><i>whispering to Rien,  at least insist that RIEN decides when a piece of guidance is important enough to count!</i> </font><br>

[Fri Jul 30 18:08:18 2004] : <B>Dorothea</B>: <font color='#000080'>howdy!</font><br>
[Fri Jul 30 18:08:24 2004] : <B>Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>Accepting Lionheart's guidance is in no way central to the plot, Adrian. It's just a way of simplifying some things while possibly complicating others.</font><br>
[Fri Jul 30 18:08:36 2004] : <B>Dorothea</B>: <font color='#000080'>(oh, I'm not telling him not to do it)</font><br>
[Fri Jul 30 18:08:42 2004] : <B>Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>Really, though, it's a DM crutch. :) Taking his bargain lets me yank Rien around like I want.</font><br>
[Fri Jul 30 18:08:50 2004] : <B>Dorothea</B>: <font color='#000080'>(I can just *feel* Renate gritting her teeth, though)</font><br>
[Fri Jul 30 18:09:25 2004] : <B>Rien</B>: <font color='#804040'>hmmmmm</font><br>
[Fri Jul 30 18:10:34 2004] : <i><B>Rien</B> (whispering): <font color='#804040'><font color='#804040'>rather than trancey?</font></font></i><br>
[Fri Jul 30 18:10:42 2004] : <B>Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>If you don't take the bargain, you'll just have to find your own way&#8212;and isn't that what life is all about?</font><br>
[Fri Jul 30 18:10:48 2004] : <B>Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>There'll be other hints, other storylines.</font><br>
[Fri Jul 30 18:11:05 2004] : <font color='#0000ff'><i>whispering to Rien,  oh, either way... just make sure WL isn't shortchanging you, I mean</i> </font><br>
[Fri Jul 30 18:11:19 2004] : <font color='#0000ff'><i>whispering to Rien,  if you're going to take the deal at all, that is</i> </font><br>
[Fri Jul 30 18:11:24 2004] : <B>Rien</B>: <font color='#804040'>ok then...I'll ask you: As DM, which would you rather do?  Have a crutch or go the long way?</font><br>
[Fri Jul 30 18:11:38 2004] : <i><B>Rien</B> (whispering): <font color='#804040'><font color='#804040'>oh, ok</font></font></i><br>
[Fri Jul 30 18:11:50 2004] : <B>Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>I honestly don't care. Lionheart's bargain lets me railroad you down a specific path (or make you fight to get away from it)...</font><br>
[Fri Jul 30 18:11:59 2004] : <B>Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>...but I don't need you going down that path to begin with.</font><br>
[Fri Jul 30 18:12:09 2004] : <B>Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>Or if I do, there are other ways to urge you.</font><br>
[Fri Jul 30 18:12:33 2004] : <B>Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>Without Lionheart's three pieces of guidance, there are plenty of other ways to set you on the track. Flashbacks, random oracles, stuff like that.</font><br>
[Fri Jul 30 18:12:48 2004] : <B>Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>They'll be more difficult and obscure, but they'll also allow you to escape Lionheart's "favor."</font><br>
[Fri Jul 30 18:13:02 2004] : <B>Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>Then again, while Rien is thinking, Lionheart calls in his favor from Renate...</font><br>
[Fri Jul 30 18:13:18 2004] : <B>Dorothea</B>: <font color='#000080'>*sigh* yep, he can do that...</font><br>
[Fri Jul 30 18:13:28 2004] : <B>Dorothea</B>: <font color='#000080'>... what does the bastard want?</font><br>
[Fri Jul 30 18:13:42 2004] : <B>Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>...on the pirate base, there is a ruined shrine to a Lady of Faerie. Her name was Lyria.</font><br>

[Fri Jul 30 18:13:53 2004] : <B>Rien</B>: <font color='#804040'>or that :)</font><br>
[Fri Jul 30 18:14:02 2004] : <B>Rien</B>: <font color='#804040'>hehehe</font><br>
[Fri Jul 30 18:14:15 2004] : <B>Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>She must be restored as a divine patron.</font><br>
[Fri Jul 30 18:14:44 2004] : <B>Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>And how is this done?</font><br>
[Fri Jul 30 18:14:54 2004] : <B>Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>Lionheart assures Renate that Lyria will not be at all abhorrent to her, hence fulfilling the "something she'd want to do anyway" criterion.</font><br>
[Fri Jul 30 18:15:04 2004] : <B>Rien</B>: <font color='#804040'>I believe this is aout goddess of lost causes</font><br>
[Fri Jul 30 18:15:26 2004] : <B>Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>Sure, but as far as Renate goes, that's an on-the-scene punchline.</font><br>
[Fri Jul 30 18:15:32 2004] : <B>Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>Renate takes it under advisement. If she and Lyria get along, it's a deal. Otherwise, she refuses and the obligation is still in effect.</font><br>
[Fri Jul 30 18:15:36 2004] : <B>Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>"So wait... you're the patron of <i>what?</i>"</font><br>
[Fri Jul 30 18:15:52 2004] : <font color='#0000ff'><i>whispering to Alan,  (we all know it's gonna work out, but Renate really doesn't like WL)</i> </font><br>
[Fri Jul 30 18:16:22 2004] : <B>Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>At the site of her shrine, Lyria can contact the minds of those who seek her. For the past two thousand years, that's meant "nobody."</font><br>
[Fri Jul 30 18:16:37 2004] : <B>Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>She will have more details.</font><br>
[Fri Jul 30 18:16:51 2004] : <B>Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>Fine. Renate makes a mental note to get back in touch with Noble Sapphire.</font><br>

[Fri Jul 30 21:27:43 2004] : <B>Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>There are markings on the disc, very faint, worn away with time and the elements; but they appear to be religious in nature.</font><br>

[Fri Jul 30 21:29:44 2004] : <font color='#008000'>** Aryk looks around for Kaelie Alastor **</font><br>
[Fri Jul 30 21:29:44 2004] : <B>Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>There's an abstract nature to the markings, although that could just be the weathering; but they betray the finely-honed aesthetics of faerie iconography.</font><br>

[Fri Jul 30 21:35:05 2004] : <B>Aryk</B>: <font color='#000080'>"Perhaps..." Aryk says to Rien and Renate, "everyone should await rescue, and the three of us should search for Mr. Tomaque."</font><br>

[Fri Jul 30 21:35:50 2004] : <B>Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>"Understood. Good luck to you."</font><br>
[Fri Jul 30 21:35:58 2004] : <B>Aryk</B>: <font color='#000080'>"My gut tells me I'd feel a whole lot better if everyone here remained in groups.  Safety in numbers."</font><br>

You stare at the magical glyph for a few seconds, and its pronunciation becomes clear in your mind.

[Fri Jul 30 21:40:32 2004] : <B>Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>Taking Aryk firmly by the elbow, Renate retreats into the jungle outside the clearing.</font><br>

[Fri Jul 30 21:41:25 2004] : <B>Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>The volcano is to the north, so you're in the southern quadrant of the island.</font><br>
[Fri Jul 30 21:41:36 2004] : <B>Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>Galask was blown to the northwest.</font><br>
[Fri Jul 30 21:41:59 2004] : <B>Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>Well, if the ruins don't offer anything intriguing, northward ho, then.</font><br>
[Fri Jul 30 21:42:17 2004] : <B>Aryk</B>: <font color='#000080'>(Alright)</font><br>
[Fri Jul 30 21:42:32 2004] : <B>Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>The ruins might offer something intriguing. Are you going to do Whirlwind Lionheart's task?</font><br>
[Fri Jul 30 21:42:45 2004] : <B>Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>Gonna try, yes.</font><br>
[Fri Jul 30 21:43:07 2004] : <B>Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>Well, Celia and the others have vacated the clearing.</font><br>
[Fri Jul 30 21:43:08 2004] : <B>Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>You'll notice the "if" clause above. *Do* the ruins offer anything intriguing?</font><br>
[Fri Jul 30 21:43:17 2004] : <B>Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>Ah, very well, then. Let's explore.</font><br>
[Fri Jul 30 21:43:42 2004] : <B>Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>There's a big stone disc, about half of which is visible above the ground; the other half seems buried in rock.</font><br>
[Fri Jul 30 21:43:44 2004] : <B>Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>"Aryk, can you see how far these go?" Renate asks.</font><br>
[Fri Jul 30 21:43:53 2004] : <B>Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>In rock, or in dirt?</font><br>
[Fri Jul 30 21:44:11 2004] : <B>Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>How can we tell it's a disc, then? Might just be a half-circle.</font><br>
[Fri Jul 30 21:44:15 2004] : <B>Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>As you examine the rest of the ruins, and your vision slowly recovers somewhat, they too seem trapped partly in volcanic rock.</font><br>
[Fri Jul 30 21:44:47 2004] : <B>Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>May well be, except that the markings are cut off sharply by the black-gray rock the disc may or may not be embedded in.</font><br>
[Fri Jul 30 21:45:23 2004] : <B>Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>"Hm. Looks like this stuff got caught in a lava flow. This is basalt, here, but the circle isn't. It's -- granite, I think."</font><br>
[Fri Jul 30 21:45:42 2004] : <B>Aryk</B>: <font color='#000080'>"Um... so it was some primal faerie temple, a volcano went off, and then 'oops!'  End of religion."</font><br>

[Fri Jul 30 21:46:07 2004] : <B>Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>"Maybe the volcano didn't just 'go off,' Aryk."</font><br>
[Fri Jul 30 21:46:30 2004] : <B>Aryk</B>: <font color='#000080'>"What think something triggered it?"</font><br>
[Fri Jul 30 21:46:32 2004] : <font color='#0000ff'><i>whispering to Alan,  yeah, but it pays to check out one's surroundings. ;)</i> </font><br>
[Fri Jul 30 21:46:47 2004] : <B>Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>"I don't know. I think I'm going to try to find out, though."</font><br>
[Fri Jul 30 21:47:16 2004] : <B>Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>With her back to the stone, Renate puts her hands on it, then levers herself up to sit on it.</font><br>
[Fri Jul 30 21:47:42 2004] : <B>Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>She closes her eyes -- against the sun? the sun is still veiled in cloud -- and bows her head.</font><br>
[Fri Jul 30 21:48:18 2004] : <B>Aryk</B>: <font color='#000080'>"What's she doing, Rien?"  Aryk whispers</font><br>
[Fri Jul 30 21:48:33 2004] : <B>Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>"I'm meeting someone, Aryk. At least, I think I am. Now hush, please."</font><br>
[Fri Jul 30 21:48:58 2004] : <font color='#008000'>** Renate settles her mind, giving it a single word to focus on: "Lyria." **</font><br>
[Fri Jul 30 21:49:35 2004] : <B>Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>Long moments pass; and gradually, the jungle noises, and Aryk's fidgeting, and the distant sound of surf, fade into complete silence.</font><br>
[Fri Jul 30 21:49:55 2004] : <B>Aryk</B>: <font color='#000080'>"I think she might have received a blow to the head," Aryk whispers more quitely to Rien.</font><br>
[Fri Jul 30 21:50:02 2004] : <B>Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>At the same time, even though your eyes are closed, you see, as clearly as you ever have.</font><br>
[Fri Jul 30 21:50:39 2004] : <B>Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>You are in a temple, a small domed shrine really; its floor is a single disc of some white stone, etched with a clear and sharp faerie design.</font><br>
[Fri Jul 30 21:51:21 2004] : <B>Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>Though the shrine is intact, the glass skylights of its stone-ribbed dome are shattered, and trash litters the interior.</font><br>
[Fri Jul 30 21:51:59 2004] : <B>Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>Your viewpoint moves; you've left your body behind. You pass without sensation through the shuttered doors of the shrine...</font><br>
[Fri Jul 30 21:52:15 2004] : <B>Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>...and into the street of a city the likes of which you have never seen.</font><br>
[Fri Jul 30 21:53:06 2004] : <B>Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>The classic "Elven" architecture you have seen in some places as an affectation proves majestic and elegant, not overwrought and artsy, when an entire city is crafted in that image.</font><br>
[Fri Jul 30 21:53:57 2004] : <B>Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>And although there is still no sound you can hear, the streets bustle with tall, slim figures, walking with matchless grace, like fine dancers or elite warriors, even about their daily business.</font><br>
[Fri Jul 30 21:54:18 2004] : <B>Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>They are elves; you're receiving a vision of an elven city at the height of civilization.</font><br>
[Fri Jul 30 21:54:20 2004] : <B>Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>If she were in her body, she would weep for glories lost; but now, all she can do is look, and pass soundlessly on.</font><br>
[Fri Jul 30 21:55:18 2004] : <B>Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>Their beauty, grace, and refinement are obvious; as is their hauteur, their arrogance. They do not avoid the eyes of the human servants who eke out a living near them; they literally do not see.</font><br>
[Fri Jul 30 21:55:39 2004] : <B>Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>She stores as much of it as she can in memory -- the curve of a balcony rail, the majesty of a columned portico, the whisper of silk on the tall, graceful men and women.</font><br>
[Fri Jul 30 21:55:59 2004] : <B>Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>And though the great temples of Whirlwind Lionheart, and Gabriel, and even Kahan, are abustle with activity, the lonely shrine from which your vision came is forgotten.</font><br>
[Fri Jul 30 21:56:33 2004] : <B>Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>This is a neighborhood of temples; and as you keep your silent vigil down the street, your half-controlled viewpoint is lured to a Chaos temple carved of red rock.</font><br>
[Fri Jul 30 21:57:42 2004] : <B>Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>Its doorway is like a leering mouth; purple flames burn in braziers. What manner of temple can this be? Though it seems forbidding, people worship therein... though they go there swathed in robes and masks to hide their identity.</font><br>
[Fri Jul 30 21:58:02 2004] : <B>Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>Once within, it becomes clear to you that everyone in the temple knows the identity of his peers... the masks are a game, to hide from outsiders.</font><br>
[Fri Jul 30 21:58:31 2004] : <B>Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>So that these worshippers, publicly at odds, can work together to control the people they rule... these worshippers of Dadaluma... the Liar.</font><br>
