[Fri Dec 16 23:31:35 2005] : <B>(3) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>It would be little wonder if it caused serious damage down in the shantytown.</font><br>

[Fri Dec 16 23:36:27 2005] : <B>(3) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>Which <i>should</i> bring this chapter to a conclusion. Whew!</font><br>
[Fri Dec 16 23:36:40 2005] : <B>(1) Rien</B>: <font color='#004040'>Okay, now that the log is no longer on I can ask this question here instead</font><br>
[Fri Dec 16 23:36:41 2005] : <B>(5) Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>I think Ren'll be glad just to get down from the heights. Her poor head must be spinning like a top.</font><br>
[Fri Dec 16 23:36:45 2005] : <B>(3) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>Or at least, bring the original point of the chapter to a conclusion.</font><br>
[Fri Dec 16 23:36:49 2005] : <B>(1) Rien</B>: <font color='#004040'>So can RIen perform this 'planar injunction" to sever the connection between Artargus and the Mask?</font><br>
[Fri Dec 16 23:37:14 2005] : <B>(3) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>A planar disjunction is just that -- something that dis-joins two planes.</font><br>
[Fri Dec 16 23:37:40 2005] : <B>(3) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>I don't remember if Rien has been able to do that or not.</font><br>
[Fri Dec 16 23:38:00 2005] : <B>(3) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>Have I ruled that you can cut planar links, such as the link that allows a demon to stay in the human world?</font><br>
[Fri Dec 16 23:38:22 2005] : <B>(1) Rien</B>: <font color='#004040'>No, I don't believe he's ever tried</font><br>
[Fri Dec 16 23:39:04 2005] : <B>(3) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>Hm. Slice the Shimmering Light is pretty good with its known effects: it can strip away magical defenses, cut through magical barriers or walls, dispel illusions, and counter spells that are coming straight at you.</font><br>
[Fri Dec 16 23:39:30 2005] : <B>(3) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>I think I'd say that it can't banish demons or dispel channeling, but Aryk's Demon Slayer technique can.</font><br>
[Fri Dec 16 23:39:53 2005] : <B>(5) Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>Wouldn't surprise me to find out that Holmstock had an anti-demon trick up his sleeve.</font><br>
[Fri Dec 16 23:39:55 2005] : <B>(1) Rien</B>: <font color='#004040'>Wait... there's unknown effects still?</font><br>
[Fri Dec 16 23:39:59 2005] : <B>(4) Aryk</B>: <font color='#000080'>Which I finallly got to use tonight, and that made me happy.</font><br>
[Fri Dec 16 23:40:19 2005] : <B>(1) Rien</B>: <font color='#004040'>hmmm</font><br>
[Fri Dec 16 23:40:27 2005] : <B>(1) Rien</B>: <font color='#004040'>wait... I think you hav ruled he can do that before</font><br>
[Fri Dec 16 23:41:00 2005] : <B>(3) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>Overarching Justice Strike has a chance to outright kill demons or undead it hits; so I imagine it could dispel channeling too.</font><br>
[Fri Dec 16 23:41:05 2005] : <B>(1) Rien</B>: <font color='#004040'>we were in a fight... last chapter, I think.  Some diabilist was summoning in imps, and Rien was in the mirror realm Slicing them out before they could manafest fully</font><br>
[Fri Dec 16 23:41:18 2005] : <B>(3) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>Someone who is channeling a demon or angel counts in the same general category as someone who summons one.</font><br>
[Fri Dec 16 23:41:56 2005] : <B>(3) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>Ah, I remember that, but in my mind Rien was Slicing the magic itself. Countering the summons before they could complete.</font><br>
[Fri Dec 16 23:42:06 2005] : <B>(1) Rien</B>: <font color='#004040'>okay</font><br>
[Fri Dec 16 23:42:21 2005] : <B>(3) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>Heck, if you see someone putting on a red mask, you could try to slice the channeling attempt as a counterspell.</font><br>
[Fri Dec 16 23:42:40 2005] : <B>(3) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>I just don't want to let Rien's menu of abilities get too comprehensive.</font><br>
[Fri Dec 16 23:42:44 2005] : <B>(1) Rien</B>: <font color='#004040'>is there a time-limit on how long the channelling can last?</font><br>
[Fri Dec 16 23:42:57 2005] : <B>(3) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>Right now he's got a bunch of elemental attacks and a bunch of counters.</font><br>
[Fri Dec 16 23:43:27 2005] : <B>(1) Rien</B>: <font color='#004040'>in other words, if we encounter Red masks at the next altar will they already be Masked, or will they have to wait until we get there, lest thier time run out too soon</font><br>
[Fri Dec 16 23:43:29 2005] : <B>(3) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>Someone's got elemental protection, regeneration, haste or something, Rien has Breaks; for incoming spells, he can Slice; he can teleport by Slicing form plane to plane.</font><br>
[Fri Dec 16 23:43:35 2005] : <B>(3) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>It's a pretty nice assortment of moves.</font><br>
[Fri Dec 16 23:44:03 2005] : <B>(3) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>The longer a Red Mask channels special powers, the more of Artagus's energy he uses up.</font><br>
[Fri Dec 16 23:44:21 2005] : <B>(1) Rien</B>: <font color='#004040'>so they'll wait until we're there</font><br>
[Fri Dec 16 23:44:36 2005] : <B>(3) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>The exact mechanics of how it works aren't too important (there are actually priests who grant each Red Mask an allotment of energy).</font><br>
[Fri Dec 16 23:44:37 2005] : <B>(1) Rien</B>: <font color='#004040'>lest the burn poor Artargus to a little DEMONIC cinder</font><br>
[Fri Dec 16 23:44:49 2005] : <B>(3) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>What's important is that yes, they have a limited amount of power they can expend.</font><br>
[Fri Dec 16 23:45:00 2005] : <B>(3) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>The more important their job is, the more power they have available, of course.</font><br>
[Fri Dec 16 23:46:07 2005] : <B>(1) Rien</B>: <font color='#004040'>of course... but they don't know which altar we're going ot next</font><br>
[Fri Dec 16 23:47:03 2005] : <B>(3) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>Right, and they can't extrapolate unless they know which ones you've already been to.</font><br>
[Fri Dec 16 23:47:11 2005] : <B>(5) Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>The question is whether we even have a choice, though.</font><br>
[Fri Dec 16 23:47:18 2005] : <B>(3) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>They can make an educated guess that you're going to one that's closer to the Fountain, though.</font><br>
[Fri Dec 16 23:47:26 2005] : <B>(3) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>Which narrows the options a lot.</font><br>
[Fri Dec 16 23:47:32 2005] : <B>(1) Rien</B>: <font color='#004040'>we do, since Cultist Boy didn't know where all of them are</font><br>
[Fri Dec 16 23:47:53 2005] : <B>(1) Rien</B>: <font color='#004040'>now, see ,we really shoulda messed with them by starting in and working out</font><br>
[Fri Dec 16 23:47:54 2005] : <B>(3) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>The High Masters know, though, and they weren't born yesterday.</font><br>
[Fri Dec 16 23:48:00 2005] : <B>(1) Rien</B>: <font color='#004040'>oh well, hindsight is 20/20</font><br>
[Fri Dec 16 23:48:21 2005] : <B>(5) Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>nah, then we'd have to cut back through the entire lot of them to get to the Fountain</font><br>
[Fri Dec 16 23:48:22 2005] : <B>(5) Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>that's no good</font><br>
[Fri Dec 16 23:50:00 2005] : <B>(1) Rien</B>: <font color='#004040'>do we actually have to get to the Fountain?</font><br>
[Fri Dec 16 23:50:05 2005] : <B>(5) Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>yes</font><br>
[Fri Dec 16 23:50:12 2005] : <B>(5) Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>Mia does, at any rate.</font><br>
[Fri Dec 16 23:50:13 2005] : <B>(1) Rien</B>: <font color='#004040'>I just thoguht Mia's spirit was going ot b taken into it</font><br>
[Fri Dec 16 23:50:23 2005] : <B>(1) Rien</B>: <font color='#004040'>bleh... "to be"</font><br>
[Fri Dec 16 23:50:40 2005] : <B>(3) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>Well, if so, her body has to be there first.</font><br>
[Fri Dec 16 23:51:28 2005] : <B>(1) Rien</B>: <font color='#004040'>okay, yes, sorry.  I missed that part where she said that</font><br>
