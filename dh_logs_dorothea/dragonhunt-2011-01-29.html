[Sat Jan 29 18:23:32 2011] : <b>(143) Alan</b>: <font color='#612769'>When I bake bread, I'm mostly focusing on cutting out the boring parts. So I make food processor bread with a pretty straight-up process.</font><br />
[Sat Jan 29 18:24:15 2011] : <b>(130) Rien</b>: <font color='#263607'>Well, the sponge is dead easy to do.  Flour, water and yeast.  The yeast will feed on some of the gluten as it expands. It really does look like a sponge when it's ready.</font><br />
[Sat Jan 29 18:24:26 2011] : <b>(126) Renate</b>: <font color='#000080'>I have discovered that long rises at room temperature make better bread than shorter, warmer ones.</font><br />
[Sat Jan 29 18:24:38 2011] : <b>(143) Alan</b>: <font color='#612769'>Proof the yeast as normal; mix flour, water, yeast, and salt in the food processor using the dough blade until it forms a ball; rise, punch, loaf, rise. Yeah, long rise.</font><br />
[Sat Jan 29 18:25:01 2011] : <b>(130) Rien</b>: <font color='#263607'>Mix it in with the rest and you get softer, more extendable protein chains so you get fluffier bread.</font><br />

[Sat Jan 29 20:22:35 2011] : <b>(143) Alan</b>: <font color='#612769'>On Renate's mental map, she can sense the people in the mansion all gathering in the dining hall, even the servants.</font><br />
[Sat Jan 29 20:22:48 2011] : <b>(126) Renate</b>: <font color='#000080'>She'll encourage Rien to hustle, then!</font><br />
[Sat Jan 29 20:22:57 2011] : <b>(126) Renate</b>: <font color='#000080'>Better to have him lead, in an unfamiliar space.</font><br />
[Sat Jan 29 20:23:04 2011] : <b>(143) Alan</b>: <font color='#612769'>There are a few stragglers, but after a few minutes, everyone Renate can detect is gathered in what feels like the same room.</font><br />
[Sat Jan 29 20:23:04 2011] : <b>(126) Renate</b>: <font color='#000080'>She doesn't want to run into anything or knock anything over.</font><br />
[Sat Jan 29 20:24:12 2011] : <b>(143) Alan</b>: <font color='#612769'><i>I'll stall until you give me the word,</i> Sabine says; then she leaves the mental connection open as she begins to address the gathering.</font><br />
[Sat Jan 29 20:24:35 2011] : <b>(143) Alan</b>: <font color='#612769'>So instead of hearing Sabine's subvocalized thoughts, Renate mentally overhears what Sabine is saying.</font><br />
[Sat Jan 29 20:24:55 2011] : <b>(126) Renate</b>: <font color='#000080'><i>We're on our way. When you have a moment, tell me what Chastillon is like, physically.</i></font><br />

[Sat Jan 29 20:26:29 2011] : <b>(143) Alan</b>: <font color='#612769'>Renate can hear it clearly with her mind and faintly with her ears.</font><br />
[Sat Jan 29 20:26:32 2011] : <b>(130) Rien</b>: <font color='#263607'>Rien leads Renate through the halls, careful not to make any sound, supressing the magic he normally emanates.</font><br />

[Sat Jan 29 20:29:42 2011] : <b>(143) Alan</b>: <font color='#612769'>Kligh finishes saying something about a series of investments.

[Sat Jan 29 20:32:06 2011] : <b>(143) Alan</b>: <font color='#612769'>Renate has to concentrate to place the exact person Sabine is referring to, but once she does, she can probably pick him out of a crowd. He's definitely feeling a bit nervous.</font><br />
[Sat Jan 29 20:32:29 2011] : <b>(126) Renate</b>: <font color='#000080'>Okay. Anything he's carrying, or has in his pockets, that she might worry about?</font><br />
[Sat Jan 29 20:33:11 2011] : <b>(143) Alan</b>: <font color='#612769'>Sabine passes around a newspaper article detailing some of the business arrangements that implicate Chastillon and others, to further angry protests.</font><br />
[Sat Jan 29 20:33:44 2011] : <b>(143) Alan</b>: <font color='#612769'>Renate can't tell. He'd have to be wielding (or idly fingering) something for her to know he has it.</font><br />
[Sat Jan 29 20:33:54 2011] : <b>(143) Alan</b>: <font color='#612769'><i>Are you in position? I can cut to the chase any time.</i></font><br />
[Sat Jan 29 20:34:03 2011] : <b>(126) Renate</b>: <font color='#000080'>Okay. Anything on any of the rest of them?</font><br />

[Sat Jan 29 20:34:27 2011] : <b>(126) Renate</b>: <font color='#000080'>Are we in position?</font><br />
[Sat Jan 29 20:35:09 2011] : <b>(143) Alan</b>: <font color='#612769'>Some of the men probably have ornamental daggers, but none of them have the body language of experienced fighters.</font><br />
[Sat Jan 29 20:35:27 2011] : <b>(126) Renate</b>: <font color='#000080'>"The one Sabine suspects is fortyish, wearing a blue coat. He's at about two o'clock as you look into the room," Renate whispers to Rien.</font><br />
[Sat Jan 29 20:37:11 2011] : <b>(143) Alan</b>: <font color='#612769'>Through Sabine's eyes, Renate can see a chest sitting in the center of the dining room table. It's padlocked. Sabine explained earlier that the mansion's owner locked the murder weapon, and Sir Carlos's sword and any weapons anyone else had, in the chest and dropped the key down a drain in the kitchen. So actually I guess that answers Renate's question -- no <i>known</i> deadly weapons are available.</font><br />
[Sat Jan 29 20:37:44 2011] : <b>(143) Alan</b>: <font color='#612769'>Sir Carlos didn't have his sword on him when he was killed; he'd left it in the cloakroom like a proper dinner guest.</font><br />
[Sat Jan 29 20:37:46 2011] : <b>(126) Renate</b>: <font color='#000080'>Well, that's a relief.</font><br />
[Sat Jan 29 20:38:01 2011] : <b>(126) Renate</b>: <font color='#000080'>And yeah, Renate is suppressing some serious grief and outrage about that.</font><br />
[Sat Jan 29 20:38:14 2011] : <b>(130) Rien</b>: <font color='#263607'>Rien readies himself for a rapid advancement into the room, aiming to get behind Chastilion.</font><br />
[Sat Jan 29 20:38:29 2011] : <b>(126) Renate</b>: <font color='#000080'>"Just stop him magicking." Renate unlimbers her lasso.</font><br />
[Sat Jan 29 20:38:29 2011] : <b>(143) Alan</b>: <font color='#612769'>Sabine's not happy about it either. Renate gets the impression that they'd been making eyes at one another.</font><br />
[Sat Jan 29 20:39:48 2011] : <b>(143) Alan</b>: <font color='#612769'>The bodies, for the record, are in the root cellar; a practicality suggested by Sabine.</font><br />
[Sat Jan 29 20:39:59 2011] : <b>(126) Renate</b>: <font color='#000080'>Sensible. Renate is proud of her sister.</font><br />
[Sat Jan 29 20:40:50 2011] : <b>(143) Alan</b>: <font color='#612769'><i>Okay, listen for me to say "and just one more thing." It's the traditional phrase, right?</i></font><br />
[Sat Jan 29 20:42:03 2011] : <b>(143) Alan</b>: <font color='#612769'>Kligh finishes explaning some dry point of property law which would allow the company in question to profit from Forthman's death, and then Sabine -- now moving in for the kill -- details Chastillon's history with Forthman, and what magical lore he stands to gain, thus laying bare his motive. There are sounds of outrage.</font><br />
[Sat Jan 29 20:43:30 2011] : <b>(126) Renate</b>: <font color='#000080'><i>Do you think I am stupid?</i> Renate opens the door with the hand holding most of her lasso, leaving her throwing hand free. "If we could all just remain calm, please, we'll have everyone out and safe quickly."</font><br />
[Sat Jan 29 20:43:54 2011] : <b>(143) Alan</b>: <font color='#612769'>Chastillon speaks up for the first time, loudly declaiming that "I had my differences with the man, of course. Let there be no secret! But that was over twenty years ago, and I am no man to hold a grudge. I knew that Martinson Associates held some of his property, but they hold property from many of you as well! Can you produce one shred of evidence to suggest that I would actually consider murder?"</font><br />
[Sat Jan 29 20:44:16 2011] : <b>(143) Alan</b>: <font color='#612769'>Then he turns with alarm, along with everyone else, at Renate's arrival.</font><br />
[Sat Jan 29 20:44:26 2011] : <b>(130) Rien</b>: <font color='#263607'>Can Rien sense the residue of the dagger?</font><br />
[Sat Jan 29 20:44:49 2011] : <b>(126) Renate</b>: <font color='#000080'>(good question!)</font><br />
[Sat Jan 29 20:45:43 2011] : <b>(143) Alan</b>: <font color='#612769'>Nope; magical artifacts seldom leave a trace the way a spellcasting does, and even a spellcasting would have no detectable trace after three hours.</font><br />
[Sat Jan 29 20:46:31 2011] : <b>(126) Renate</b>: <font color='#000080'>"Gentlemen, ladies. The Gereval police are aware of this situation and working to free everyone."</font><br />
[Sat Jan 29 20:46:50 2011] : <b>(143) Alan</b>: <font color='#612769'>Sabine bobs a curtsey. "Lady Renate von Adler and Prince Rien Gerevannin. Forgive me, Lady Ironknuckle, I invited them without your approval."</font><br />
[Sat Jan 29 20:47:14 2011] : <b>(143) Alan</b>: <font color='#612769'>The named dowager, the party's hostess, nods mutely.</font><br />
[Sat Jan 29 20:47:44 2011] : <b>(126) Renate</b>: <font color='#000080'>"Madam. I do apologize for the discourtesy. As I approached, though, there did seem to be a sort of situation...?"</font><br />
[Sat Jan 29 20:47:53 2011] : <b>(143) Alan</b>: <font color='#612769'>Rien can't sense the dagger itself, either; it wouldn't be very good at assassinating mages if they could feel it coming.</font><br />
[Sat Jan 29 20:48:00 2011] : <b>(126) Renate</b>: <font color='#000080'>(Once again, Renate is trying not to let on about the telepathy.)</font><br />
[Sat Jan 29 20:48:10 2011] : <b>(130) Rien</b>: <font color='#263607'>(However, he can pretend like he does)</font><br />
[Sat Jan 29 20:48:16 2011] : <b>(143) Alan</b>: <font color='#612769'>"Quite," she says, managing to gather some breath.</font><br />
[Sat Jan 29 20:48:23 2011] : <b>(126) Renate</b>: <font color='#000080'>(HER talent everyone knows about. Sabine's, not so much.)</font><br />
[Sat Jan 29 20:48:51 2011] : <b>(143) Alan</b>: <font color='#612769'>"There certainly is a situation. I seem to find myself on the receiving end of a vile slander," says Mr. Chastillon, his long waxed goatee quivering.</font><br />
[Sat Jan 29 20:49:34 2011] : <b>(130) Rien</b>: <font color='#263607'>Rien stalks into the room, moving around behind Chastillon, nostrils flaring as he inhales deeply.  "I can smell it on you.  It stinks in this room, stronger here.  Dark magic, wrong.  Magic not born of the fire of life."</font><br />
[Sat Jan 29 20:50:11 2011] : <b>(126) Renate</b>: <font color='#000080'>Renate will watch the rest of the room. If this is an incorrect finger, someone else won't be able to help a small sigh of relief.</font><br />
[Sat Jan 29 20:51:10 2011] : <b>(143) Alan</b>: <font color='#612769'>(If you need mental images of people's clothing, which you probably don't, you can think of the Silver Coast as being 1700s and Gereval as being 1800s.)</font><br />
[Sat Jan 29 20:51:24 2011] : <b>(143) Alan</b>: <font color='#612769'>Also, good call.</font><br />
[Sat Jan 29 20:51:46 2011] : <b>(143) Alan</b>: <font color='#612769'>"I say," says a woman faintly, in response to Rien's performance.</font><br />
[Sat Jan 29 20:52:07 2011] : <b>(143) Alan</b>: <font color='#612769'>"I daresay so, I daresay," replies her escort.</font><br />
[Sat Jan 29 20:52:58 2011] : <b>(143) Alan</b>: <font color='#612769'>"Your highness, I assure you, the only thing you smell on me is Faelrahn." Renate vaguely recognizes it as a brand of cologne.</font><br />
[Sat Jan 29 20:53:30 2011] : <b>(143) Alan</b>: <font color='#612769'><i>And you accuse <b>me</b> of melodrama?</i> Sabine asks Renate.</font><br />
[Sat Jan 29 20:53:30 2011] : <b>(126) Renate</b>: <font color='#000080'>(It was Adrian's idea. I thought it was a good one!)</font><br />
[Sat Jan 29 20:54:08 2011] : <b>(126) Renate</b>: <font color='#000080'><i>You aren't the only one I accuse of it.</i></font><br />
[Sat Jan 29 20:54:40 2011] : <b>(143) Alan</b>: <font color='#612769'><i>Fair point. Are you ready for us to lay out the conclusive bits?</i></font><br />
[Sat Jan 29 20:54:50 2011] : <b>(126) Renate</b>: <font color='#000080'><i>Yes, I am watching.</i></font><br />
[Sat Jan 29 20:55:21 2011] : <b>(143) Alan</b>: <font color='#612769'>"Ladies and gentlemen. Do you remember, at our last meeting, the affair of the bracelet?" Sabine waits a moment for a noise of general assent.</font><br />
[Sat Jan 29 20:56:08 2011] : <b>(143) Alan</b>: <font color='#612769'>"...well, here it is." From her reticule, she withdraws a bracelet of thin gold plates and dangles it at eye level, looking past it to Chastillon.</font><br />
[Sat Jan 29 20:56:59 2011] : <b>(143) Alan</b>: <font color='#612769'>Chastillon freezes, but to Renate's senses, he goes through at least three cycles of tensing for action and inwardly slumping in defeat. Defeat finally wins out, as his eyes dart between Renate and Rien.</font><br />
[Sat Jan 29 20:57:28 2011] : <b>(143) Alan</b>: <font color='#612769'>"I deny everything, and will have my day in court," he says, a second before the entire room bursts out in commotion.</font><br />
[Sat Jan 29 20:57:32 2011] : <b>(126) Renate</b>: <font color='#000080'><i>Well done, Sabine. Chastillon just admitted it, to my eyes. Not that that's court-worthy evidence.</i></font><br />
[Sat Jan 29 20:57:59 2011] : <b>(143) Alan</b>: <font color='#612769'>"Tie him up!" yells a nearby old gentleman in ribbon-festooned military garb.</font><br />
[Sat Jan 29 20:58:23 2011] : <b>(143) Alan</b>: <font color='#612769'>"Never mind, I'll do it myself!" the excited old man rips off a long strip of tablecloth, much to Lady Ironknuckle's consternation.</font><br />
[Sat Jan 29 20:58:35 2011] : <b>(126) Renate</b>: <font color='#000080'>"There is no need for such measures, I am sure. If you will come this way, Mister Chastillon?"</font><br />
[Sat Jan 29 20:58:42 2011] : <b>(130) Rien</b>: <font color='#263607'>"Sir," Rien says, a growl in his voice, "please desist."</font><br />
[Sat Jan 29 21:00:18 2011] : <b>(143) Alan</b>: <font color='#612769'>"Of course. You may brand me a murderer, but I shall endure far worse before I cease to be a gentleman." He raises his hands peaceably and follows Renate's directions.</font><br />
[Sat Jan 29 21:00:59 2011] : <b>(143) Alan</b>: <font color='#612769'>"If all our murderers were as gentlemanly," Kligh says bitterly, "our police would have a far easier time of it."</font><br />
[Sat Jan 29 21:01:29 2011] : <b>(126) Renate</b>: <font color='#000080'>We'll just isolate him in a room with closed windows. No need to be barbaric about things.</font><br />
[Sat Jan 29 21:03:35 2011] : <b>(143) Alan</b>: <font color='#612769'>About a half-hour later -- which gives Kligh and Sabine a little time to catch up with Renate to the extent that they can without distracting her from watching Chastillon -- the barrier falls before a complex Artificer apparatus. Later, Rien learns that the apparatus allows qualified mages to focus their powers on microscopically small areas, which was necessary for the Spellbreakers to unravel the spell.</font><br />
[Sat Jan 29 21:04:11 2011] : <b>(126) Renate</b>: <font color='#000080'>Any Church types around? We'll need them to deal with this knife thing.</font><br />
[Sat Jan 29 21:06:11 2011] : <b>(143) Alan</b>: <font color='#612769'>The murderer has to intentionally undo the soul capture effect, and the undoing requires simply an act of will, which presents a legal and moral quandary.</font><br />
[Sat Jan 29 21:06:36 2011] : <b>(143) Alan</b>: <font color='#612769'>If Chastillon maintains his innocense, he can just touch the knife and pretend to have willed the souls to be released. Then, the fact that they aren't released means he's not the murderer.</font><br />
[Sat Jan 29 21:07:07 2011] : <b>(143) Alan</b>: <font color='#612769'>The act of will doesn't have to be wholly voluntary, so he could be tortured into doing it; but he can't be painlessly mind-controlled into doing it, because then it's not an act of will.</font><br />
[Sat Jan 29 21:07:22 2011] : <b>(143) Alan</b>: <font color='#612769'>He can't ethically be tortured into doing it if he isn't proven guilty, though.</font><br />
[Sat Jan 29 21:08:17 2011] : <b>(143) Alan</b>: <font color='#612769'>After thinking it through, Larousse says Chastillon's case will be given utmost priority, and will be denied the opportunity for jury trial.</font><br />
[Sat Jan 29 21:08:56 2011] : <b>(126) Renate</b>: <font color='#000080'>"Is there a chance of clemency if Mister Chastillon frees the trapped souls?" Renate asks.</font><br />
[Sat Jan 29 21:08:59 2011] : <b>(143) Alan</b>: <font color='#612769'>Instead, invoking a little-used branch of law, an inquisitor will determine his guilt or innocence within two weeks.</font><br />
[Sat Jan 29 21:09:29 2011] : <b>(143) Alan</b>: <font color='#612769'>"Maybe. Not for me to guess. I'll be working with the inquisitor, though, so I'll ask."</font><br />
[Sat Jan 29 21:10:01 2011] : <b>(126) Renate</b>: <font color='#000080'>"Why not ask him now? I hate the idea of leaving them there."</font><br />
[Sat Jan 29 21:11:01 2011] : <b>(143) Alan</b>: <font color='#612769'>"Tell you what, I'll see if we can wake up the Royal Prosecutor. He'd be handling a high-profile case like this anyway."</font><br />

[Sat Jan 29 21:12:09 2011] : <b>(143) Alan</b>: <font color='#612769'>Twenty minutes later, that august personage himself is on the scene, in hunting boots pulled over pajama pants. His initial annoyance at the interruption has been replaced with enthusiasm for such a twisty case.</font><br />
[Sat Jan 29 21:13:04 2011] : <b>(143) Alan</b>: <font color='#612769'>After hearing the details, he agrees on the spot to a bargain: release the souls for resurrection, and the state will level lesser charges totalling five years in prison and a punishing chunk of asset forfeiture.</font><br />
[Sat Jan 29 21:13:22 2011] : <font color='#008000'>** (126) Renate <font color='#008000'>bows to him in mute thanks.</font> **</font><br />
