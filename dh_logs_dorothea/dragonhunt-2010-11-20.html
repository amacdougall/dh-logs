[Sat Nov 20 18:03:59 2010] : <b>(6071) Aryk</b>: <font color='#800000'>I went total Jojo with that one.  They're more or less in the same stance.</font><br />
[Sat Nov 20 18:05:05 2010] : <b>(6071) Aryk</b>: <font color='#800000'>Then I realized that I drew Emily the same way, but I was like, "Ah, fuck it.  I've taken too long getting this to Alan."</font><br />

[Sat Nov 20 18:10:33 2010] : <b>(6071) Aryk</b>: <font color='#800000'>Thursday, but I work at Disney, which means I don't get holidays anymore.</font><br />
[Sat Nov 20 18:10:35 2010] : <b>(6070) Alan</b>: <font color='#000080'>Oh crap, yeah, I'll be visiting home for Thanksgiving next weekend. I could play, technically, but my family-and-friends time is scarce enough that I think we should cancel that session.</font><br />
[Sat Nov 20 18:10:48 2010] : <b>(6068) Renate</b>: <font color='#000080'>That's fine. Sounds like it's a good deal for everyone.</font><br />

[Sat Nov 20 18:11:12 2010] : <b>(6070) Alan</b>: <font color='#000080'>So if Adrian will leave early, and Matt arrives late, and I have a limited window to meet all my Chicago/Milwaukee people, I guess we should let that one slide.</font><br />

[Sat Nov 20 18:12:04 2010] : <b>(6070) Alan</b>: <font color='#000080'>Quite possibly.</font><br />
[Sat Nov 20 18:12:50 2010] : <b>(6066) Rien</b>: <font color='#263607'>So since last session was All About The Rien, other people's turn first this time?</font><br />
[Sat Nov 20 18:12:56 2010] : <b>(6070) Alan</b>: <font color='#000080'>So to get the chronology straight in my head -- at the same time as Rien and Daniel are catching, losing, and then burgling Spitfire, are Aryk, Emily, and Renate sending Hojo to Frowntown?</font><br />
[Sat Nov 20 18:13:27 2010] : <b>(6070) Alan</b>: <font color='#000080'>That would imply that Gravin and Lehron are doing something which has momentarily slipped my mind.</font><br />
[Sat Nov 20 18:13:48 2010] : <b>(6070) Alan</b>: <font color='#000080'>But would logically involve Rockham.</font><br />
[Sat Nov 20 18:13:52 2010] : <b>(6068) Renate</b>: <font color='#000080'>I think Aryk wanted the three of them to look further into the matter of Miss Violet.</font><br />
[Sat Nov 20 18:14:13 2010] : <b>(6068) Renate</b>: <font color='#000080'>Gravin and Lehron can have Knifeboy if they want him.</font><br />
[Sat Nov 20 18:14:28 2010] : <b>(6068) Renate</b>: <font color='#000080'>Yell if I'm wrong, Matt.</font><br />
[Sat Nov 20 18:14:30 2010] : <b>(6070) Alan</b>: <font color='#000080'>Ah, right, since Hojo didn't take long (not as long as the Spitfire sequence, at least); and since Heliomere's men are known to have Miss Violet's cooperation.</font><br />
[Sat Nov 20 18:14:46 2010] : <b>(6070) Alan</b>: <font color='#000080'>Except for Spitfire, the rest of Heliomere's lieutenants are staying in her safehouses.</font><br />
[Sat Nov 20 18:16:02 2010] : <b>(6068) Renate</b>: <font color='#000080'>For certain values of "safe."</font><br />
[Sat Nov 20 18:16:14 2010] : <b>(6070) Alan</b>: <font color='#000080'>Lehron ran into a few old acquaintances, mercs he trusts, and hired them to put an ear to the ground and back him up if needed. He'll rustle them up and get them to cover the exits when he goes to lean on Rockham.</font><br />
[Sat Nov 20 18:16:32 2010] : <b>(6066) Rien</b>: <font color='#263607'>And certain other values of "house".</font><br />
[Sat Nov 20 18:16:37 2010] : <b>(6070) Alan</b>: <font color='#000080'>Gravin's along, not far away, because his powers are actually pretty good at shaking people out of trees, so to speak.</font><br />
[Sat Nov 20 18:17:01 2010] : <b>(6071) Aryk</b>: <font color='#800000'>(I can't remember, honestly, but that sounds right)</font><br />
[Sat Nov 20 18:17:03 2010] : <b>(6070) Alan</b>: <font color='#000080'>So they're going to see what they can find out from Rockham, blowing their thin cover as needed. I don't think true stealth was ever a plan.</font><br />
[Sat Nov 20 18:17:34 2010] : <b>(6070) Alan</b>: <font color='#000080'>So, starting it up. We'll get a report from Gravin and Lehron at some point.</font><br />

A "drug house" is where the product is sold and consumed, and since it's such an obvious target, there's seldom more than a day's worth of money or drugs there. These runners are surely taking the money and drugs -- split into multiple packages for safety -- to a "stash house," a more heavily fortified place that acts as a local distribution hub.</font><br />

[Sat Nov 20 21:01:10 2010] : <b>(6068) Renate</b>: <font color='#000080'>I wasn't trying to play him as one, actually.</font><br />

[Sat Nov 20 21:04:04 2010] : <b>(6071) Aryk</b>: <font color='#800000'>Not that lucky, I'm guessing.  And no, as for our "plan," there was always specualtion, I think, something like this would happen.</font><br />

[Sat Nov 20 21:07:16 2010] : <b>(6070) Alan</b>: <font color='#000080'>Naguru and Kodaku were rivals in the Zion game... friendly rivals, but still distant. Naguru even taught Kodaku some of his Eternal Capital style, because that's how hobgoblins bond -- by fighting.</font><br />
[Sat Nov 20 21:07:33 2010] : <b>(6070) Alan</b>: <font color='#000080'>Kodaku had a mind power too: he could "absorb" the fighting style of anyone he fought for long enough, and use their moves against them.</font><br />
[Sat Nov 20 21:07:58 2010] : <b>(6070) Alan</b>: <font color='#000080'>Naguru, knowing this, drew out one of his several duels with Kodaku, intentionally letting Kodaku learn his secret style.</font><br />

[Sat Nov 20 21:09:31 2010] : <b>(6070) Alan</b>: <font color='#000080'>Instead of reaching out and reconciling, like Renate did, they clashed with him over and over. Always in a manly spirit of brotherly competition, but never in a true alliance.</font><br />
[Sat Nov 20 21:10:18 2010] : <b>(6070) Alan</b>: <font color='#000080'>That's why Naguru went down a different path: he planned to conquer the Patchwork Kingdoms himself, and instead of a military invasion, he planned to use a "flaming sword," just like Hob, the mythical founder of the goblin races.</font><br />
[Sat Nov 20 21:10:51 2010] : <b>(6070) Alan</b>: <font color='#000080'>Hob's legendary sword was called Erethrak, and prophecies said that some day Hob would be reborn, and would wield Erethrak again.</font><br />

[Sat Nov 20 21:11:36 2010] : <b>(6070) Alan</b>: <font color='#000080'>Naguru, as you can guess, interpreted the modern-day Erethrak as Orbital Battlestation Kailaser (as it was called in the Zion game).</font><br />
[Sat Nov 20 21:12:17 2010] : <b>(6070) Alan</b>: <font color='#000080'>There were no katana keys in that game, but the heroes raced Naguru to the long-forgotten warp gate up to the battlestation, and arrived after him.</font><br />
