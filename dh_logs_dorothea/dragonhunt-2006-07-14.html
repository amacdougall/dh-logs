[Fri Jul 14 19:19:05 2006] : <B>(1) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>Mr. Sinister still makes no sense to me. I don't know his background or his powers (except "evil" and "whatever serves the plot"), and his name is retarded.</font><br>

[Fri Jul 14 19:19:37 2006] : <B>(6) Aryk</B>: <font color='#000080'>You're not supposed to know what he can do.  That's kind of his thing.  But his background and motives change with every new writer.</font><br>
[Fri Jul 14 19:19:55 2006] : <B>(4) Rien</B>: <font color='#004000'>He was a geneticist well, well ahead of his time, back in the 1700s, I think.  Apocolypse granted him immortality (kinda) and resources and all this other shit.</font><br>
[Fri Jul 14 19:20:11 2006] : <B>(1) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>Apocalypse is basically Magneto without the interesting background.</font><br>

[Fri Jul 14 19:21:00 2006] : <B>(5) Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>Okay, so I'll just assume I can't have any actual effect on the course of events, and not worry about it. That works.</font><br>
[Fri Jul 14 19:21:02 2006] : <B>(1) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>Sorry, I'm thinking about this stuff because I recently started reading my old X-downloads again.</font><br>

[Fri Jul 14 19:24:46 2006] : <B>(1) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>I imagine Aryk and Arretia, at least, were up pretty late with the afterparty; Superior Tech was playing a new style he's working on, which sounds a lot like Arretia's power-pop on serious depressant chemicals.</font><br>
[Fri Jul 14 19:25:22 2006] : <B>(6) Aryk</B>: <font color='#000080'>Yeah, they probably were.  </font><br>
[Fri Jul 14 19:25:43 2006] : <B>(1) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>But if anyone happens to be up early, they'll notice Ryofu Kasugano at a window seat in the Blue Boar, scarfing down steak and eggs with an expression of determination.</font><br>
[Fri Jul 14 19:25:47 2006] : <B>(5) Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>Well, Renate's likely to stay up until she's reasonably convinced nothing's going to go boom if she goes to sleep.</font><br>

[Fri Jul 14 19:26:24 2006] : <B>(4) Rien</B>: <font color='#004000'>And Rien's going to be up until he's sure that Renate's going to go to sleep.</font><br>

[Fri Jul 14 19:26:57 2006] : <B>(4) Rien</B>: <font color='#004000'>Not like they haven't before.</font><br>
[Fri Jul 14 19:27:14 2006] : <B>(1) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>Oh, Ryofu's early departure isn't a necessary plot hook, just a convenient way of getting some information across if anyone were there.</font><br>
[Fri Jul 14 19:27:31 2006] : <B>(5) Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>Eh. Renate doesn't like early. Rien, you take this one.</font><br>

[Fri Jul 14 19:28:18 2006] : <B>(4) Rien</B>: <font color='#004000'>Whatever works.</font><br>
[Fri Jul 14 19:28:20 2006] : <B>(1) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>Hm. We can explain the late night by saying that Wren asked Renate to tie up loose ends for her as long as she's imprisoned.</font><br>
[Fri Jul 14 19:28:38 2006] : <B>(1) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>So Our Heroes were all around town helping keep things to a simmer.</font><br>
[Fri Jul 14 19:28:51 2006] : <B>(5) Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>Fair enough.</font><br>
[Fri Jul 14 19:29:19 2006] : <B>(1) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>The case against Wren looks very slim, by the way, and both she and the local police are confident she'll be released as soon as a judge can review all the information.</font><br>

[Fri Jul 14 19:29:49 2006] : <B>(1) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>But under the circumstances, bringing her in was the only reasonable choice for the cops.</font><br>

[Fri Jul 14 19:31:38 2006] : <B>(5) Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>"What is the nature of their grievance?"</font><br>

[Fri Jul 14 19:35:12 2006] : <B>(1) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>"I do not know. The telegram only ordered me to return quickly."</font><br>
[Fri Jul 14 19:36:23 2006] : <B>(4) Rien</B>: <font color='#004000'>"Hmm... I hate to sound like a ssupicious cynicist, but are you certain that the telegram comes from whom you believe it does?"</font><br>
[Fri Jul 14 19:37:30 2006] : <B>(5) Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>"There is that. But why would anyone object to your presence here, Kasugano-sama?"</font><br>
[Fri Jul 14 19:37:32 2006] : <B>(6) Aryk</B>: <font color='#000080'>"Could be Hell."</font><br>
[Fri Jul 14 19:37:55 2006] : <B>(1) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>"No, not entirely. It definitely comes from Kudan. And Kudan is small enough... the telegraph workers would not agree to send a message falsely in the name of the grandmaster."</font><br>
[Fri Jul 14 19:38:12 2006] : <B>(1) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>"It is more reasonable to think it is genuine."</font><br>
