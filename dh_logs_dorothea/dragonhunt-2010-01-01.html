[Fri Jan  1 18:07:26 2010] : <b>(1673) Alan</b>: <font color='#000080'>He joined the Army, as far as I can tell, because it would provide the structure and guidance he couldn't give himself.</font><br />

[Fri Jan  1 18:09:12 2010] : <b>(1673) Alan</b>: <font color='#000080'>It's a decision that's hard to justify and naturally draws questions, so I can't blame him.</font><br />
[Fri Jan  1 18:09:52 2010] : <b>(1675) Aryk</b>: <font color='#710000'>Hm.  He always struck me as a pretty confident person.  But I don't know him all that well.</font><br />
[Fri Jan  1 18:10:07 2010] : <b>(1673) Alan</b>: <font color='#000080'>He had his BFA -- his ticket to the middle class. Army was a weird choice.</font><br />
[Fri Jan  1 18:10:41 2010] : <b>(1674) Renate</b>: <font color='#000080'>I don't blame him. I just don't think he needs to engage in that effort, and could find better uses for the mental energy.</font><br />

[Fri Jan  1 18:17:53 2010] : <b>(1673) Alan</b>: <font color='#000080'>Well, let's discuss stuff. How am I doing on loose ends so far? Have I left anything important hanging without hints or updates?</font><br />
[Fri Jan  1 18:18:57 2010] : <b>(1673) Alan</b>: <font color='#000080'>This is the phase where I'm really going to be concentrating on established themes and characters instead of introducing new ones.

[Fri Jan  1 18:19:24 2010] : <b>(1673) Alan</b>: <font color='#000080'>And it's entirely in my nature to skip over something that might have seemed important, just because my perspective is different.</font><br />
[Fri Jan  1 18:19:54 2010] : <b>(1675) Aryk</b>: <font color='#710000'>Most of my stuff is cleared up.  Loose threads are Garland and Emily and how they're getting on, and defeating every fighter in the Deadly Fighters one by one.</font><br />
[Fri Jan  1 18:22:00 2010] : <b>(1674) Renate</b>: <font color='#000080'>Hm.</font><br />

[Fri Jan  1 18:22:38 2010] : <b>(1674) Renate</b>: <font color='#000080'>But it seems like most of Renate's stuff is tied up with the fate of the world.</font><br />

[Fri Jan  1 18:23:40 2010] : <b>(1673) Alan</b>: <font color='#000080'>Yeah, I'm still holding on to the Rainbow thing. Daniel actually knows the move too, but ... did he ever explain about that?</font><br />
[Fri Jan  1 18:24:02 2010] : <b>(1673) Alan</b>: <font color='#000080'>If he didn't, I guess I'll hold onto it. His status is a bit unclear, by the way, yeah. Need to write a story about that.</font><br />
[Fri Jan  1 18:24:22 2010] : <b>(1675) Aryk</b>: <font color='#710000'>Not that I'd call it a loose, thread, but Aryk hasn't checked on the Churchies in forever, either, though I imagine they might come back into play when the Adam storyline kicks in.</font><br />
[Fri Jan  1 18:24:47 2010] : <b>(1673) Alan</b>: <font color='#000080'>Dorothy Durai is a total WTF, yeah. A fair amount of it is that she's just messed up in the head (let's be honest here).</font><br />
[Fri Jan  1 18:25:57 2010] : <b>(1673) Alan</b>: <font color='#000080'>She insists on betraying everyones' expectations -- so as your image of her changes, she'll keep doing different things to make sure you don't feel like you "understand" her. She finds the very concept stifling.</font><br />
[Fri Jan  1 18:26:10 2010] : <b>(1673) Alan</b>: <font color='#000080'>This should not really be a revelation.</font><br />

[Fri Jan  1 18:28:03 2010] : <b>(1673) Alan</b>: <font color='#000080'>The main question is whether he'll come back and cause trouble, or whether trouble will find him.</font><br />
