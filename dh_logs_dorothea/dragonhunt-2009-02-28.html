Rien has never seen spellcraft like that, but he's heard of Spellbreaker magic which counter-strikes when dispelled, so this must be a similar metamagic.</font><br />

[Sat Feb 28 01:14:18 2009] : <b>(23130) Alan</b>: <font color='#000080'>More pinpoints of light are coming, but fewer this time; as they descend, Fantome jets across the sky, moving to a new position. Rien can barely make out his arms moving, perhaps casting another spell as he goes.</font><br />

[Sat Feb 28 01:16:04 2009] : <b>(23130) Alan</b>: <font color='#000080'>Now that would probably be quite effective.</font><br />
[Sat Feb 28 01:16:53 2009] : <b>(23130) Alan</b>: <font color='#000080'>Now, there's a risk that, if the energy balls were designed to go into the Mirror Realm when dispelled, they might go back into this one when dispelled in the Mirror Realm.</font><br />
[Sat Feb 28 01:17:17 2009] : <b>(23130) Alan</b>: <font color='#000080'>Of course, there's a limit to just how much metamagic you can pack into one thing. Reacting to a dispel attempt is very advanced stuff.</font><br />

[Sat Feb 28 01:21:56 2009] : <b>(23130) Alan</b>: <font color='#000080'>The first swipe cuts through about half the accumulated Mirror Realm energy balls, and blessedly, it appears to annihilate them.

[Sat Feb 28 02:26:41 2009] : <b>(23133) Alan</b>: <font color='#000080'>(He took the fancy-pants elixir ahead of time.)</font><br />
[Sat Feb 28 02:26:54 2009] : <b>(23129) Aryk</b>: <font color='#710000'>Chenji catches up.  "There's nothing we can do!  Rien's throwing around power not meant for this world!"</font><br />
[Sat Feb 28 02:27:22 2009] : <b>(23133) Alan</b>: <font color='#000080'>Rien can also see that Fantome's magical reserves are near an end.</font><br />

[Sat Feb 28 02:29:18 2009] : <b>(23128) Rien</b>: <font color='#003300'>Hmm</font><br />
[Sat Feb 28 02:29:21 2009] : <b>(23128) Rien</b>: <font color='#003300'>Actually</font><br />
[Sat Feb 28 02:29:45 2009] : <b>(23128) Rien</b>: <font color='#003300'>Rien lets the death curse hit him.  A little false security on the enemy's part never hurts.</font><br />
[Sat Feb 28 02:30:20 2009] : <b>(23133) Alan</b>: <font color='#000080'>Fantome is not taking anything for granted; even as his spell flies, he flies after it, reaching out with hands that are just skeleton and tendon.</font><br />
[Sat Feb 28 02:32:23 2009] : <b>(23131) Renate</b>: <font color='#000080'>Renate feels the death, even as far away as she is; a scream of grief and rage tears through her throat, and she redoubles her efforts against Chenji's cage.</font><br />
[Sat Feb 28 02:34:08 2009] : <b>(23133) Alan</b>: <font color='#000080'>Even as he confirms that Rien was killed by his spell, Fantome grabs Rien by the throat again, intending to destroy Rien's body. If it was to be a gentlemanly duel at any point, it is not now. But at that moment the elixir takes effect and Rien is restored to full life.</font><br />
[Sat Feb 28 02:34:27 2009] : <b>(23129) Aryk</b>: <font color='#710000'>Chenji dodges a huge chunk of rock, narrowly missing his head, and as he does so for a moment the barrier gives, allowing Renate through.</font><br />
[Sat Feb 28 02:37:14 2009] : <b>(23131) Renate</b>: <font color='#000080'>"RIEN!" Renate is running again, heedless of the ordinary physical barriers battering her, only Chenji's uncertain alcoholic sense of the world to guide her.</font><br />
[Sat Feb 28 02:39:55 2009] : <b>(23129) Aryk</b>: <font color='#710000'>Chenji again follows.</font><br />
[Sat Feb 28 02:42:51 2009] : <b>(23128) Rien</b>: <font color='#003300'>Rien's sword immediate sweeps up, trailing blue light.  His sword sweeps through Fantome's body, bisecting him, a wave of plasma sweeping out from each side, blowing the Lich apart.</font><br />
[Sat Feb 28 02:44:07 2009] : <b>(23133) Alan</b>: <font color='#000080'>There's nothing left of him but dry bone, withered ligaments, packed ash; he explodes into dust and shards and is gone.</font><br />
[Sat Feb 28 02:44:19 2009] : <b>(23128) Rien</b>: <font color='#003300'>(Too many sweepings... I really need to re-read things before I hit enter)</font><br />
[Sat Feb 28 02:46:17 2009] : <b>(23129) Aryk</b>: <font color='#710000'>Chenji skids to a halt.  "Alright!  YA DID IT!"</font><br />
[Sat Feb 28 02:46:34 2009] : <b>(23133) Alan</b>: <font color='#000080'>As Renate gets closer to Rien, she feels strange things: bushes whose leaves feel like fur pads, wind that blows only at face level in a gentle stripe, chimes in the air. Chenji sees trees with bright blue leaves, and stones floating above the ground.</font><br />
[Sat Feb 28 02:47:16 2009] : <b>(23133) Alan</b>: <font color='#000080'>For hundreds of meters all around Rien, the area looks like it was hit by a wave of Chaos.</font><br />
[Sat Feb 28 02:48:41 2009] : <b>(23128) Rien</b>: <font color='#003300'>Rien returns to his normal, limited self with a feeling that is much akin to relief, mostly because that's exactly what it is.</font><br />
[Sat Feb 28 02:48:49 2009] : <b>(23133) Alan</b>: <font color='#000080'>And in the last fleeting seconds before Rien's consciousness drops back down to normal, he realizes that's exactly what happened: he opened a conduit to the primal chaos in the depths of the plane, and used its unformed essence as a source of magical power.</font><br />
[Sat Feb 28 02:49:15 2009] : <b>(23131) Renate</b>: <font color='#000080'>Renate hardly cares; her only concern is her lover, whom she felt die.</font><br />
[Sat Feb 28 02:49:36 2009] : <b>(23133) Alan</b>: <font color='#000080'>Not a Chaos power, as he once thought himself a Chaos being... but a planar power of great versatility and danger.</font><br />
[Sat Feb 28 02:49:47 2009] : <b>(23133) Alan</b>: <font color='#000080'>(There. There's at least one small hint for you.)</font><br />
[Sat Feb 28 02:50:07 2009] : <b>(23131) Renate</b>: <font color='#000080'>Customarily, the victor enjoys a kiss from a pretty girl; but Rien will have to settle for a bleeding, bruised, half-crazed, all-too-mortal Renate.</font><br />
[Sat Feb 28 02:51:47 2009] : <b>(23131) Renate</b>: <font color='#000080'>"Rien! Saints and angels, I felt you die..."</font><br />
[Sat Feb 28 02:52:22 2009] : <b>(23128) Rien</b>: <font color='#003300'>Rien holds as tightly onto Renate as he can, "that would be because I did.  It was done on purpose, however; marvelous stuff, this elixer."</font><br />
[Sat Feb 28 02:53:49 2009] : <b>(23131) Renate</b>: <font color='#000080'>"Oh. Oh! Oh, thank goodness." She kisses him; he can taste blood on her lips.</font><br />
[Sat Feb 28 02:54:31 2009] : <b>(23128) Rien</b>: <font color='#003300'>"Now, however did you manage to get so bruised, my love?  Am I going to have to chastise Chenji?"  Rien speaks with such light-heartedness only because he's riding the biggest adrenaline high of his life, and it's either laugh like a loon or cry like a fightened child.</font><br />
[Sat Feb 28 02:55:06 2009] : <b>(23131) Renate</b>: <font color='#000080'>She hits at him with the flat of her hand. "I'm still blind, you know. Chenji's no help at all."</font><br />
[Sat Feb 28 02:56:00 2009] : <b>(23128) Rien</b>: <font color='#003300'>Rien laughs and kisses Renate in a manner best left for the bedroom.</font><br />
[Sat Feb 28 02:56:15 2009] : <b>(23129) Aryk</b>: <font color='#710000'>Chenji folds his arms and scowls at Rien.  "Chastise me?  You're the one needs chastisin'!  You broke the restrictions on your powers!  You opened up a whole new can of worms there, buddy!"</font><br />
[Sat Feb 28 02:57:51 2009] : <b>(23128) Rien</b>: <font color='#003300'>"I'd be interested to know just how much you know about that, Chenji, but later.  I don't supposed someone could help me up, could they?  I should probably let someone know that Fantome is no more."  The look he directs at Renate also indicates that he'd dearly like to become reacquainted with his lover.</font><br />
[Sat Feb 28 02:58:35 2009] : <font color='#008000'>** (23131) Renate <font color='#008000'>gladly gives him a hand up.</font> **</font><br />

[Sat Feb 28 03:01:45 2009] : <b>(23131) Renate</b>: <font color='#000080'>"All right. Can you walk, or should we rest a little first?"</font><br />
[Sat Feb 28 03:02:40 2009] : <b>(23129) Aryk</b>: <font color='#710000'>Rien is suddenly knocked to the ground, and his face becomes disgustingly wet and slimey.  "NO!" screams Chenji.  "BAD!  GET OFF!"</font><br />

[Sat Feb 28 03:06:08 2009] : <b>(23131) Renate</b>: <font color='#000080'>Not really. It could just be all the Chaos power running around.</font><br />
[Sat Feb 28 03:06:13 2009] : <b>(23131) Renate</b>: <font color='#000080'>Chenji just THINKS it's his dog.</font><br />
[Sat Feb 28 03:06:47 2009] : <b>(23128) Rien</b>: <font color='#003300'>Maybe the malleable nature of the Chaos energy means that Rien's just allowed Chenji's dog to permanents manifest.</font><br />
