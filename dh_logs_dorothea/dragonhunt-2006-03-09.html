[Thu Mar  9 19:14:24 2006] : <B>(2) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>Well, the phones that come with GPS right now definitely can be used for law enforcement to track you down, but you can also disable it if you're planning to rob a bank...</font><br>

[Thu Mar  9 19:16:33 2006] : <B>(2) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>There is at least one person on the list who you've encountered before, but unfortunately not with a name you'd recognize.</font><br>
[Thu Mar  9 19:16:40 2006] : <B>(2) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>Ah, kettle's whistling.</font><br>
[Thu Mar  9 19:16:48 2006] : <B>(1) Rien</B>: <font color='#004040'>Would we recognise them by powers?</font><br>
[Thu Mar  9 19:17:09 2006] : <B>(3) Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>And has Rien made the list yet?</font><br>
[Thu Mar  9 19:17:20 2006] : <B>(3) Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>I'm curious to know what's generally known about him.</font><br>
[Thu Mar  9 19:17:31 2006] : <B>(3) Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>Also, I should think there's a list of question-marks. Anybody we know on it?</font><br>
[Thu Mar  9 19:17:53 2006] : <B>(3) Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>(Rien may be, in fact. Depends how fast news travels.)</font><br>
[Thu Mar  9 19:18:34 2006] : <B>(2) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>There's an appendix of people who have been acting in ways consistent with dragonrank candidacy, but you don't know most of them either, except for Genjiro Hideki.</font><br>
[Thu Mar  9 19:19:16 2006] : <B>(3) Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>So much for heroism. *shrug* No wonder Renate isn't interested in it.</font><br>
[Thu Mar  9 19:19:17 2006] : <B>(2) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>And there's a note that certain people are left out, such as Heaven members and prominent religious figures.</font><br>
[Thu Mar  9 19:19:55 2006] : <B>(2) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>Well, the part where you haven't heard of most of the people is that you just haven't been involved in their game -- which is the endless Civ II match in the Patchwork Kingdoms.</font><br>
[Thu Mar  9 19:20:20 2006] : <B>(3) Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>That may come. We'll have to see.</font><br>
[Thu Mar  9 19:20:27 2006] : <B>(2) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>The vast majority of dragonrank folks get there through feats of arms, strategy, government under fire, or leveraged diplomacy.</font><br>
[Thu Mar  9 19:20:44 2006] : <B>(2) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>Those are uniformly violent skills quite separate from what Renate's interested in so far.</font><br>
[Thu Mar  9 19:20:45 2006] : <B>(3) Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>Well, leveraged diplomacy we seem to be not half bad at. :)</font><br>
[Thu Mar  9 19:21:08 2006] : <B>(3) Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>But you're right about the violence.</font><br>
[Thu Mar  9 19:21:34 2006] : <B>(2) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>Well, by "leveraged diplomacy" I mostly mean "convincing people they're doomed unless they meet conditions foo and bar."</font><br>
[Thu Mar  9 19:21:43 2006] : <B>(3) Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>Ah. Heaven-style diplomacy. Gotcha.</font><br>
[Thu Mar  9 19:22:15 2006] : <B>(2) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>One of the dragonrank candidates is a "mediator" Devoted to Lisanne, the angel of the forge.</font><br>
[Thu Mar  9 19:22:33 2006] : <B>(3) Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>Interesting. Renate would take note of that name.</font><br>
[Thu Mar  9 19:22:41 2006] : <B>(3) Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>Someone to learn from, perhaps.</font><br>
[Thu Mar  9 19:22:43 2006] : <B>(2) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>He forged alliances, usually grossly unequal but still better than war; but he also summons angelic firearms to defend himself if things go wrong.</font><br>
[Thu Mar  9 19:23:01 2006] : <B>(1) Rien</B>: <font color='#004040'>firearms?</font><br>
[Thu Mar  9 19:23:02 2006] : <B>(2) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>His most powerful spell/gun is called Ultima Ratio, of course.</font><br>
[Thu Mar  9 19:23:11 2006] : <B>(1) Rien</B>: <font color='#004040'>aren't they forbidden by dragon accord?</font><br>
[Thu Mar  9 19:23:25 2006] : <B>(1) Rien</B>: <font color='#004040'>oh</font><br>
[Thu Mar  9 19:23:26 2006] : <B>(1) Rien</B>: <font color='#004040'>no</font><br>
[Thu Mar  9 19:23:30 2006] : <B>(1) Rien</B>: <font color='#004040'>that's gunpowder</font><br>
[Thu Mar  9 19:23:38 2006] : <B>(2) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>Yes and no. The principles of firearms are well-known, but nobody has discovered a suitable gunpowder (due to dragon discouragement).</font><br>
[Thu Mar  9 19:23:57 2006] : <B>(2) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>However, there's a sacred metal which, when powdered, produces the same result. So angels can have guns.</font><br>
[Thu Mar  9 19:24:07 2006] : <B>(4) Aryk</B>: <font color='#000080'>HOLY firearms are okay.</font><br>
[Thu Mar  9 19:24:11 2006] : <B>(2) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>Exactly.</font><br>
[Thu Mar  9 19:24:26 2006] : <B>(2) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>Gah, this food I'm eating just cut the roof of my mouth for no obvious reason.</font><br>
[Thu Mar  9 19:24:35 2006] : <B>(2) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>Did I mention it's spicy, salty, and acidic?</font><br>
[Thu Mar  9 19:24:47 2006] : <B>(1) Rien</B>: <font color='#004040'>You did now</font><br>
[Thu Mar  9 19:25:09 2006] : <B>(2) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>Anyway, what's the next step? Meet up with Solaris? You've got some slack time to do something else in the area if you want.</font><br>
[Thu Mar  9 19:25:34 2006] : <B>(3) Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>Sparky have any suggestions?</font><br>
[Thu Mar  9 19:25:35 2006] : <B>(2) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>I was going to spend part of Friday coming up with a more precise picture of the war outside Narristown, but if you ask around, I can just BS it and write down the results as I go.</font><br>
[Thu Mar  9 19:25:48 2006] : <B>(3) Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>Or does Rien want to take up anything else with the PIs?</font><br>
[Thu Mar  9 19:25:56 2006] : <B>(2) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>Yes, but more in the way of the local puppet theater being hilarious.</font><br>
[Thu Mar  9 19:26:08 2006] : <B>(2) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>See, this one puppet has a silly accent, then the other puppet punches him.</font><br>
[Thu Mar  9 19:26:16 2006] : <B>(3) Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>Woo.</font><br>
[Thu Mar  9 19:27:06 2006] : <B>(4) Aryk</B>: <font color='#000080'>I'd say if we're done with the PI's, then Solaris is the next stop.</font><br>
[Thu Mar  9 19:27:27 2006] : <B>(2) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>I'd probably recommend asking about the war, since right now you don't have too clear a picture of what's going on down there, and it'll obviously end up being vital knowledge.</font><br>
[Thu Mar  9 19:27:38 2006] : <B>(2) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>Even though that would involve me doing more work. :)</font><br>
[Thu Mar  9 19:27:39 2006] : <B>(3) Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>Yes, that was on the Solaris agenda.</font><br>
[Thu Mar  9 19:27:57 2006] : <B>(4) Aryk</B>: <font color='#000080'>Yes, once we have a reliable source to ask.  Solaris just might do.</font><br>
[Thu Mar  9 19:28:03 2006] : <B>(1) Rien</B>: <font color='#004040'>And Rien will ask what they know about himself</font><br>
[Thu Mar  9 19:28:09 2006] : <B>(1) Rien</B>: <font color='#004040'>Just because he's got an ego that way.</font><br>
[Thu Mar  9 19:28:27 2006] : <B>(1) Rien</B>: <font color='#004040'>And about how Renate can get her talent trained and such.</font><br>
[Thu Mar  9 19:30:35 2006] : <B>(2) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>All right, got my coffee, lemme resume the log.</font><br>
[Thu Mar  9 19:30:51 2006] : <B>(2) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>And I'm sorry about my forgetfulness, but fortunately we're not starting too late.</font><br>

[Thu Mar  9 19:35:46 2006] : <B>(2) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>"That is right. Only your powers&#8212;those you have exhibited; your recent history&#8212;with notable lacunae; your motivations&#8212;what we can deduce; and that you are almost certainly non-human and of great age."</font><br>

[Thu Mar  9 22:09:00 2006] : <B>(2) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>The gist is that the dragon Thousand Scales has controlled all of Ordillus except Narristown for decades now.</font><br>
[Thu Mar  9 22:09:28 2006] : <B>(2) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>He's engaged in a lot of political struggles with Red Claw Kazz, but he has never mustered enough influence to pull off a coup.</font><br>
[Thu Mar  9 22:09:59 2006] : <B>(2) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>Thousand Scales may have more manpower and material resources, but Red Claw Kazz has far superior diplomatic and political power.</font><br>
[Thu Mar  9 22:10:40 2006] : <B>(2) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>Thousand Scales appeared to be preparing for war for about a year prior to the actual outbreak... but he had no clear enemy.</font><br>
[Thu Mar  9 22:10:56 2006] : <B>(2) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>It appears that his current adversaries arose in response to his military preparations -- not the other way around.</font><br>
[Thu Mar  9 22:11:35 2006] : <B>(4) Aryk</B>: <font color='#000080'>Interesting.</font><br>
[Thu Mar  9 22:11:51 2006] : <B>(3) Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>So what kind of Bad Stuff has been happening to neutral third parties?</font><br>
[Thu Mar  9 22:12:30 2006] : <B>(2) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>The three dragons are Horizon, a gold dragon with huge shimmering wings, who lives his entire life in the upper skies; Alcaz, an ice dragon with a cold tactical mind; and Oresh the Loyal, a mandrake (dragon preferring human form) who became very popular with the locals when he lived among them in disguise.</font><br>
[Thu Mar  9 22:13:17 2006] : <B>(2) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>Oresh the Loyal made friends in dozens of villages and towns, in human guise, and became a valued member of many communities with his knowledge, strength, and evidently tremendous personal charisma.</font><br>
[Thu Mar  9 22:13:51 2006] : <B>(2) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>A month ago, he revealed himself as a dragon; a dragon whose goal and destiny was to lead the people to successful rebellion against Thousand Scales.</font><br>
[Thu Mar  9 22:14:35 2006] : <B>(3) Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>Pfeh. If he was as loyal as all THAT he'd take on Thousand Scales himself. It's not like humans have much chance against a dragon!</font><br>

[Thu Mar  9 22:14:40 2006] : <B>(4) Aryk</B>: <font color='#000080'>These three dragons are allied with Red Claw Kazz?</font><br>
[Thu Mar  9 22:14:52 2006] : <B>(2) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>The time was ripe for such an action: Thousand Scales had been running his kingdom as a personal vendetta against Red Claw Kazz for over ten years, selling food surpluses for weapons and mercenaries, expending resources in fruitless maneuvers which Kazz always bloodlessly parried.</font><br>
[Thu Mar  9 22:14:59 2006] : <B>(3) Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>Or, indeed, <em>any</em> chance.</font><br>
[Thu Mar  9 22:15:43 2006] : <B>(2) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>Oresh and his two allies don't appear to have any link with Kazz; but the obvious hypothesis is that Kazz put them up to challenging Thousand Scales, in hopes of weakening him enough to depose.</font><br>
[Thu Mar  9 22:15:54 2006] : <B>(4) Aryk</B>: <font color='#000080'>I see.</font><br>
[Thu Mar  9 22:16:33 2006] : <B>(2) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>And in an actual battle, the three dragons would have to fight Thousand Scales&#8212;dragons duel alongside their men. But it's necessary to defeat your enemy in a land campaign as well, or else you've simply killed the mayor without controlling the city.</font><br>
[Thu Mar  9 22:17:30 2006] : <B>(2) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>(The "why don't Reagan and Kruschev just fist-fight" model of grade-school politics ignores the fact that the "losing" country wouldn't give up a single one of the points that were being fought over.)</font><br>
[Thu Mar  9 22:18:10 2006] : <B>(3) Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>(Still, if you kick over the general you generally find it fairly easy to move in on the confusion. Especially in the military-junta ways dragons tend to rule.)</font><br>

[Thu Mar  9 22:19:46 2006] : <B>(2) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>Anyway, Oresh the Loyal built up a revolution army quickly and efficiently; it turned out his ally Alcaz had been planning the war from the start, and even had secret supply depots set up throughout the archipelago.</font><br>
[Thu Mar  9 22:20:41 2006] : <B>(2) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>Combine Oresh's inspiring leadership with Alcaz's strategic and logistic skills, and Horizon's sheer aerial firepower, and Thousand Scales was rocked on his heels in the first week of the war.</font><br>
[Thu Mar  9 22:21:24 2006] : <B>(4) Aryk</B>: <font color='#000080'>Nice.</font><br>
[Thu Mar  9 22:21:47 2006] : <B>(2) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>Horizon, in particular, has been a major force in weakening and dispersing Thousand Scales' responses; since he can drop powerful magic on any exposed and concentrated unit, Thousand Scales has to move his men in multiple columns, through dense jungle or mountain.</font><br>
[Thu Mar  9 22:22:27 2006] : <B>(2) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>In return, Thousand Scales has been engaging in a steady surface-to-air engagement that has lasted over a week so far; the events of last night seem to be only the latest exchange.</font><br>
[Thu Mar  9 22:22:59 2006] : <B>(3) Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>Thousand Scales is an earthbound dragon? Or does he fly?</font><br>
[Thu Mar  9 22:23:08 2006] : <B>(2) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>Horizon shows signs of weakening; he can't land in Ordillus or he'll be shot down, but if he sails off over the horizon, Thousand Scales is free to move.</font><br>
[Thu Mar  9 22:23:50 2006] : <B>(2) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>Thousand Scales is a land dragon with powerful burrowing abilities; he also has supernatural control over his own kinetic energy.</font><br>
[Thu Mar  9 22:24:22 2006] : <B>(2) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>He can "store" impacts within his own body, to be released as extra strength in any attack; and he can change direction without inertia, even in midair.</font><br>
[Thu Mar  9 22:24:35 2006] : <B>(1) Rien</B>: <font color='#004040'>If Horizon lives entirely in the upper atmosphere, why does he need to land at all?</font><br>
[Thu Mar  9 22:24:51 2006] : <B>(2) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>This means that under the right circumstances, he can leap far into the sky and then maneuver; but definitely not enough to fight Horizon.</font><br>
[Thu Mar  9 22:25:32 2006] : <B>(2) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>Horizon can rest and heal in the sky; but not while ground-based mages are throwing spells at him every so often.</font><br>
[Thu Mar  9 22:26:51 2006] : <B>(2) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>Anyway, the ground war is going poorly for the revolutionaries, despite Horizon's support; Thousand Scales' forces have secured all of Indalecio Island except for Skyseek Tower, the last redoubt of the Storm Wolves and Oresh's forces there.</font><br>
[Thu Mar  9 22:27:43 2006] : <B>(2) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>Oresh retains control of the eastern island, Aleste; but Thousand Scales has a fleet of interceptors shielded by expensive mercenary mages.</font><br>
[Thu Mar  9 22:28:11 2006] : <B>(2) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>He can't field enough of a shielded fleet to break into Skyseek Tower's harbor; but he can field enough to blockade it.</font><br>
[Thu Mar  9 22:28:21 2006] : <B>(3) Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>"Well," Renate sighs, "I made it across Ktarr's Field once, when Garland Stahl and the Reavers were scrapping. I suppose I can try to wetback the lines."</font><br>
[Thu Mar  9 22:28:44 2006] : <B>(3) Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>"Not my idea of a relaxing holiday, however."</font><br>
[Thu Mar  9 22:29:02 2006] : <B>(2) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>About half of Marsilio Island, and all of Aleste Island, is still under the revolutionaries' control.</font><br>
[Thu Mar  9 22:30:09 2006] : <B>(2) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>The war is a civil war, but Ordillans are generally not very cosmopolitan; rivalries between villages on opposite sides of rivers could turn into headhunting feuds, so the transition to fratricidal warfare wasn't hard.</font><br>
[Thu Mar  9 22:31:06 2006] : <B>(2) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>Skyseek Tower isn't directly controlled by the Skyseekers, by the way; it's named after the original explorers, just as the pirates are.</font><br>
[Thu Mar  9 22:31:07 2006] : <B>(1) Rien</B>: <font color='#004040'>Fratricide?  The explosion of one sets off the explosion of the next, and so on down the line until they're all gone?</font><br>
[Thu Mar  9 22:31:21 2006] : <B>(2) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>But although the Storm Wolves call the city home, the city is not theirs to command or anything.</font><br>

[Thu Mar  9 22:32:01 2006] : <B>(2) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>The main reason they're there on the revolutionary side is that the Perfect Thunder was shot down by Thousand Scales as a target of opportunity.</font><br>
[Thu Mar  9 22:32:29 2006] : <B>(2) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>The heresimachs of Artagus only hustled there once they learned Lonze Martinez was sealed in by the siege.</font><br>

I don't feel like we're equipped enough to make any sort of decisions on 'who's right' and 'who's wrong.' "</font><br>

[Thu Mar  9 22:51:12 2006] : <B>(4) Aryk</B>: <font color='#000080'>I'm pretty confident we'll get there.  It's after getting there that I think we might all die.</font><br>
[Thu Mar  9 22:51:14 2006] : <B>(1) Rien</B>: <font color='#004040'>Who's Martinez again?</font><br>
[Thu Mar  9 22:51:17 2006] : <B>(3) Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>Or pull a deal like was done with Mia. He'd be a good intercessor.</font><br>
[Thu Mar  9 22:51:21 2006] : <B>(4) Aryk</B>: <font color='#000080'>But, hey, it sounds fun to me.</font><br>

[Thu Mar  9 22:51:39 2006] : <B>(1) Rien</B>: <font color='#004040'>The renegade Artargian who was preaching about Artargus being a loving ol' softy?</font><br>
[Thu Mar  9 22:51:40 2006] : <B>(2) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>Next chapter is "All the Shit Goes Down"</font><br>
[Thu Mar  9 22:51:48 2006] : <B>(4) Aryk</B>: <font color='#000080'>He's the Artagusian priest that</font><br>
[Thu Mar  9 22:51:49 2006] : <B>(3) Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>Something like that, yeah.</font><br>
[Thu Mar  9 22:51:50 2006] : <B>(4) Aryk</B>: <font color='#000080'>Yeah.</font><br>
[Thu Mar  9 22:52:17 2006] : <B>(4) Aryk</B>: <font color='#000080'>He's considered a heretic amongst other Artagusian types.</font><br>
[Thu Mar  9 22:52:20 2006] : <B>(2) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>Well, he didn't preach that Artagus was completely benevolent; just that if you're going to sacrifice to him, sacrifice all those other chumps instead of your own people.</font><br>
[Thu Mar  9 22:52:31 2006] : <B>(2) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>Still a great leap forward.</font><br>
[Thu Mar  9 22:52:42 2006] : <B>(3) Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>Well, I think Mia leaped even further than that.</font><br>
[Thu Mar  9 22:53:07 2006] : <B>(3) Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>Renate is still wearing mourning, of course, for the pox-stricken and for Mia.</font><br>
[Thu Mar  9 22:53:49 2006] : <B>(3) Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>Even a good death doesn't entirely soften the blow of losing someone important.</font><br>
[Thu Mar  9 22:54:55 2006] : <B>(1) Rien</B>: <font color='#004040'>And so it shouldn't.</font><br>
[Thu Mar  9 22:55:00 2006] : <B>(3) Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>Anyway, I have an early day tomorrow, folks. Cheers!</font><br>
