[Sat Jan 17 17:44:46 2009] : <b>(21118) Rien</b>: <font color='#003300'>Rien closed his eyes and sighed.

[Sat Jan 17 20:08:13 2009] : <b>(21119) Alan</b>: <font color='#000080'>Yes, you can definitely teleport and do a spell in the same action, but only to a place within direct line of sight, or one that is very familiar, against a target in direct line of sight.</font><br />
[Sat Jan 17 20:08:23 2009] : <b>(21119) Alan</b>: <font color='#000080'>Or else you could teleport and cast blindly.</font><br />

[Sat Jan 17 20:08:40 2009] : <b>(21119) Alan</b>: <font color='#000080'>It's a tricky procedure, and you don't have time to look around and aim after coming out of the portal.</font><br />
[Sat Jan 17 20:08:55 2009] : <b>(21119) Alan</b>: <font color='#000080'>So you have to get your bearings before the teleport-spell combination.</font><br />

[Sat Jan 17 20:09:31 2009] : <b>(21119) Alan</b>: <font color='#000080'>It requires more concentration, so be warned, if you do it a lot, or under pressure, you're more likely to screw up.</font><br />
[Sat Jan 17 20:09:32 2009] : <b>(21118) Rien</b>: <font color='#003300'>Also deLeon would have to have inhuman reflexes in order to avoid Rien teleporting behind him and hitting him with lightning.</font><br />
