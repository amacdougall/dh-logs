[Fri May 28 21:12:28 2010] : <b>(8027) Renate</b>: <font color='#000080'>I just want to mention that I NOW HAVE A BOSS WHO DOES NOT SUCK. And this is awesome.</font><br />
[Fri May 28 21:12:28 2010] : <b>(8028) Alan</b>: <font color='#00008c'>I'm gonna make an arugula and mustard green salad with julienned radishes. It may well be too much flavor!</font><br />
[Fri May 28 21:12:35 2010] : <b>(8028) Alan</b>: <font color='#00008c'>Awesome!</font><br />
[Fri May 28 21:12:48 2010] : <b>(8029) Rien</b>: <font color='#263607'>It all came through?  Much with the awesome!</font><br />
[Fri May 28 21:12:50 2010] : <b>(8028) Alan</b>: <font color='#00008c'>I did notice on your blog that the new boss seemed much more promising.</font><br />

[Fri May 28 21:13:30 2010] : <b>(8029) Rien</b>: <font color='#263607'>Oh, just to warn you, the first couple of weeks of August might be a bit craptacular for me.  They want to trial a 12x7 roster for us, which means I'll be working at least one day that fortnight, and I don't know which yet.</font><br />
[Fri May 28 21:13:50 2010] : <b>(8027) Renate</b>: <font color='#000080'>Yep, and I have a concert one Friday in July.</font><br />
[Fri May 28 21:14:02 2010] : <b>(8027) Renate</b>: <font color='#000080'>But we'll manage. We always do.</font><br />
