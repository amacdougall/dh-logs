[Fri May 20 18:10:02 2005] : <B>Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>"Well," Renate answers, mindful of Rien's and Lyria's lessons, "there are certain differences of opinion as to what beauty actually is."</font><br>

[Fri May 20 18:11:08 2005] : <B>Rien</B>: <font color='#004040'>"Although socienty holds beauty to be a group consensus, the old adage still holds true: Beauty really <i>is</i> in the eye of the beholder."</font><br>

[Fri May 20 18:11:55 2005] : <B>Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>"Ah, my mistake. The threats of violence led me to a misunderstanding."</font><br>
[Fri May 20 18:12:21 2005] : <B>Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>"But that's all cleared up now," she says coolly, pausing to examine a watchmaker's display case.</font><br>

[Fri May 20 18:13:57 2005] : <B>Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>"I like the one with the amber band. That's handsome."</font><br>
[Fri May 20 18:14:21 2005] : <B>Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>"It is. With a weighty price tag."</font><br>
[Fri May 20 18:14:36 2005] : <B>Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>"I identify with it."</font><br>
[Fri May 20 18:14:59 2005] : <B>Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>"Just appreciating beauty where I find it, Mistress. I can't always own it, and that's all right with me."</font><br>
[Fri May 20 18:15:07 2005] : <B>Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>"You'd like me to repeat my Atlantis performance. Preferably in spades, isn't that right?"</font><br>
[Fri May 20 18:16:19 2005] : <B>Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>Renate's lips curve. "I'd be much obliged to anyone else for that, Mistress Durai, but I thought we'd already established that I don't have anything that you want. So I'll just say I'd find it useful."</font><br>
[Fri May 20 18:17:23 2005] : <B>Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>"I've already had a visit from someone who would prefer the reverse. One more than capable of matching my price tag, plus tax."</font><br>
[Fri May 20 18:17:44 2005] : <B>Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>In the back of her mind, she reaches for the remembered harmonica-chords that tie her to Lyria. <i>She's smarter than I am, Lady Lyria. Forgive me if I can't match her.</i></font><br>
[Fri May 20 18:18:00 2005] : <B>Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>"Hm, indeed. I can't say I'm surprised."</font><br>

[Fri May 20 18:19:36 2005] : <B>Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>"There's a way to make me bow out."</font><br>
[Fri May 20 18:20:04 2005] : <B>Rien</B>: <font color='#004040'>"We prefer not to make anyone do anything, previous expereinces not withstanding."</font><br>
[Fri May 20 18:20:26 2005] : <B>Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>"That's right, Mistress Durai. No force."</font><br>
[Fri May 20 18:20:29 2005] : <B>Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>Dorothy smiles, a thin bronze-shaded line crossed by a stray copper braid.</font><br>
[Fri May 20 18:20:57 2005] : <B>Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>"Ah. Then though my applause ring hollow in the face of the audience's... I applaud you."</font><br>
[Fri May 20 18:21:12 2005] : <B>Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>"Few have the courage to stand on their convictions as their goals crumble around them."</font><br>
[Fri May 20 18:22:00 2005] : <B>Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>Renate grimaces. "This was an extremely long shot at best. At least it's taking them some work -- and expense -- to get past me. I suppose I take my small victories where I can get them."</font><br>
[Fri May 20 18:22:11 2005] : <B>Rien</B>: <font color='#004040'>"If we were to abandon our convictions, we would not be who we are."</font><br>
[Fri May 20 18:22:20 2005] : <B>Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>"Out of curiosity, Mistress Durai, what sort of price did you have in mind?"</font><br>
[Fri May 20 18:22:32 2005] : <B>Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>"Rien, you're happy with who you are?"</font><br>

[Fri May 20 18:24:28 2005] : <B>Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>"Alas, my hellbent desire for self-destruction is forever thwarted," she cries melodramatically.</font><br>
[Fri May 20 18:25:00 2005] : <B>Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>"I'll ask. I'll even beg. But I won't make you." She rubs the sweat off her forehead with one hand. "But if it's a scene you want, well... that could be arranged."</font><br>
[Fri May 20 18:25:01 2005] : <B>Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>"Then let us continue, horn-locked, until we neutralize each other completely and cease to exist," she adds brightly.</font><br>

[Fri May 20 18:26:22 2005] : <B>Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>"That fascinates me."</font><br>
[Fri May 20 18:26:50 2005] : <B>Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>"It isn't the violence I want, sweet Renate. I want to see ... what could possibly bring it about."</font><br>
[Fri May 20 18:27:33 2005] : <B>Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>"I appreciate that you'd say that about me," Renate says soberly. "It doesn't fit with how I was trained, or what seems to be expected of me... but it's what calls me."</font><br>
[Fri May 20 18:27:46 2005] : <B>Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>"But if it's a fight you want to see, just wait for the vampires."</font><br>
[Fri May 20 18:28:17 2005] : <B>Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>"There's a stake just waiting, Mistress, and if it's me that has to wield it, well, that's just perfectly fine and dandy."</font><br>

[Fri May 20 18:29:33 2005] : <B>Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>"So an action that could endanger the lives of thousands, if only through omission, does not warrant rough play, while two murders do?"</font><br>
[Fri May 20 18:29:51 2005] : <B>Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>"A grasp of the largest picture has never been a feature of the 'principled.'"</font><br>
[Fri May 20 18:30:25 2005] : <B>Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>"It's not that simple, Mistress," Renate sighs. "Part of the problem is that the murders have already happened, while the concert's yet to play out."</font><br>
[Fri May 20 18:30:26 2005] : <B>Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>Dorothy turns down a narrow alley; in this trade district, even here there are vendors, selling discount goods from tables no larger than nightstands.</font><br>
[Fri May 20 18:30:39 2005] : <B>Rien</B>: <font color='#004040'>"And those who think they see the bigger picture often miss it's subtleties, Mistress Durai" Rien says complacently</font><br>
[Fri May 20 18:31:01 2005] : <B>Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>"Part of it is that violence tends to draw more to itself, and what I'm trying to avoid is precisely <i>more</i> violence."</font><br>
[Fri May 20 18:31:39 2005] : <B>Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>"And part of it is that I don't -- yet -- see the necessity. You've been trustworthy so far. That doesn't give me a reason to threaten violence, much less employ it."</font><br>
[Fri May 20 18:32:07 2005] : <B>Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>"I'm sorry if I'm disappointing your death-wish. Believe me, I understand how frustrating that can be."</font><br>
[Fri May 20 18:32:25 2005] : <B>Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>Dorothy doesn't laugh, but casts a backward glance that glitters with amusement.</font><br>
[Fri May 20 18:32:36 2005] : <B>Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>"Who says the wish is mine in specific?"</font><br>
[Fri May 20 18:32:57 2005] : <B>Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>"I serve a harsh conclave, whose membership is not made up entirely of my own neuroses."</font><br>
[Fri May 20 18:33:10 2005] : <B>Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>"Well, all right. I suppose your patron has an interest." A swift look upward indicates that Renate does not mean any human patron.</font><br>
[Fri May 20 18:34:34 2005] : <B>Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>"But, look, I'm trying to answer your question as best I can. You want to know what'll make me violent? An obvious, immediate need. If you make a riot out of that crowd, yes, I <i>will</i> get violent with you if there's no other way of stopping you. Are you -- excuse me, is the conclave -- satisfied with that?"</font><br>

[Fri May 20 19:05:21 2005] : <B>Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>"Well... maybe, maybe not. I don't know whether their motive in framing you was targeted specifically at you, or whether they just found you convenient."</font><br>

[Fri May 20 19:06:00 2005] : <B>Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>"Of course, if the frame was that incompetent, can I even believe implicating me was their motive?"</font><br>

[Fri May 20 19:07:17 2005] : <B>Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>"Not the wisest assessment."</font><br>
[Fri May 20 19:07:25 2005] : <B>Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>"As for motives... well, one Council member has significant reason not to be fond of me in particular."</font><br>

[Fri May 20 19:09:00 2005] : <B>Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>"I did not realize that it was so directly relevant. This 'sigil' they talk about, that gives me passage past the alarms, isn't a physical object. It's easy to forget about."</font><br>
[Fri May 20 19:09:11 2005] : <B>Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>"And... hard to get rid of. Vampire initiations tend to be of the more serious sort."</font><br>

[Fri May 20 21:44:45 2005] : <B>Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>She goes over to Durai, slipping an arm under the woman's shoulders. "Let's get you up. This isn't dignified. There we go."</font><br>
[Fri May 20 21:44:52 2005] : <font color='#008000'>** Rien stands in front of the door, his sword point-down on the ground, looking more substnatial than normal, his hands crossed on the pommel **</font><br>
[Fri May 20 21:45:02 2005] : <B>Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>"What did you take, and how much?"</font><br>
[Fri May 20 21:45:16 2005] : <B>Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>She stands up, sagging against you, face nuzzled against your neck. She's not as tall as you always thought... some of it must be attitude.</font><br>
[Fri May 20 21:45:33 2005] : <B>Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>"The Council of Balance... they killed all those people."</font><br>
[Fri May 20 21:45:59 2005] : <B>Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>Renate half-carries, half-drags her to a worn chaise, and lets her gently down onto it.</font><br>
[Fri May 20 21:46:01 2005] : <B>Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>"And now," Linetta Jenner whispers in your ear, "they're killing you."</font><br>
[Fri May 20 21:46:05 2005] : <B>Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>Log off.</font><br>
[Fri May 20 21:46:09 2005] : <B>Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>(nice!)</font><br>
[Fri May 20 21:46:30 2005] : <B>Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>It should now be evident how it all works out.</font><br>
[Fri May 20 21:46:54 2005] : <B>Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>Pretty much, yeah.</font><br>
[Fri May 20 21:46:56 2005] : <B>Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>Er, not how Good saves the day, but just the triple-cross of the vampire killings.</font><br>
[Fri May 20 21:47:08 2005] : <B>Rien</B>: <font color='#004040'>aww crap, and there's Rien outside the door, perfectly poised ot help, and all unaware</font><br>
[Fri May 20 21:47:22 2005] : <B>Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>No worries. She'll have time to scream.</font><br>
[Fri May 20 21:47:41 2005] : <B>Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>And then Aryk and Rien get there in time to keep Linetta from escaping.</font><br>
[Fri May 20 21:47:45 2005] : <B>Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>And hey, fight scene!</font><br>
[Fri May 20 21:47:54 2005] : <B>Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>yay fight scene!</font><br>
[Fri May 20 21:48:06 2005] : <B>Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>yay fight scene I don't have to worry about participating in, 'cuz I'll be dead already!</font><br>
[Fri May 20 21:48:22 2005] : <B>Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>Hah, true!</font><br>
[Fri May 20 21:48:42 2005] : <B>Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>Or at least incapacitated.</font><br>
[Fri May 20 21:49:11 2005] : <B>Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>Wow, so Linetta played Markwith for a fool. I'm impressed.</font><br>
[Fri May 20 21:49:24 2005] : <B>Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>He was dumb, but not that dumb.</font><br>
[Fri May 20 21:49:39 2005] : <B>Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>Well, when you use the love triangle and revenge on Raven as a lever...</font><br>
[Fri May 20 21:49:49 2005] : <B>Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>People have been known to agree to stupider plots.</font><br>
[Fri May 20 21:49:50 2005] : <B>Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>... you can move the world, yeah.</font><br>
[Fri May 20 21:50:05 2005] : <B>Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>And he certainly made a convincing patsy.</font><br>
[Fri May 20 21:50:14 2005] : <B>Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>That he did.</font><br>
[Fri May 20 21:50:52 2005] : <B>Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>Torrenne, by the way, deserves a terrific bitching-out for being such a fucking idiot, and if Renate manages to remember this day, she'll get one.</font><br>
[Fri May 20 21:51:06 2005] : <B>Rien</B>: <font color='#004040'>So Linetta's making use of Shaodw Illusion ot hide who she is, right?</font><br>
[Fri May 20 21:51:21 2005] : <B>Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>Yep. She's young and in love, and delightfully unaware of the risks. Torrenne is.</font><br>
[Fri May 20 21:51:27 2005] : <B>Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>Linetta dropped the illusion.</font><br>
[Fri May 20 21:51:40 2005] : <B>Rien</B>: <font color='#004040'>well, she *was* making use of it, right?</font><br>
[Fri May 20 21:51:43 2005] : <B>Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>Right.</font><br>
[Fri May 20 21:51:55 2005] : <B>Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>Renate's no fool. She's not going to scream "help!" She's going to yell "Jenner!"</font><br>
[Fri May 20 21:51:58 2005] : <B>Rien</B>: <font color='#004040'>so why didn't Rien pick it up... I had him scanning the venue for it</font><br>
[Fri May 20 21:52:12 2005] : <B>Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>Rien didn't see Jenner directly.</font><br>
[Fri May 20 21:52:14 2005] : <B>Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>Only Renate.</font><br>
[Fri May 20 21:52:15 2005] : <B>Rien</B>: <font color='#004040'>running around in the mirror realm and all that</font><br>
[Fri May 20 21:52:15 2005] : <B>Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>You're limited to visual range. This was deep backstage.</font><br>
[Fri May 20 21:52:40 2005] : <B>Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>Anything that would obstruct vision also keeps you from detecting magic.</font><br>
[Fri May 20 21:53:04 2005] : <B>Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>Except for particularly powerful sources, which might shine through walls.</font><br>
[Fri May 20 21:53:08 2005] : <B>Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>That's honestly up to DM whimsy.</font><br>
[Fri May 20 21:53:14 2005] : <B>Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>Nope, it was a good ploy, and Renate totally fell for it. Though Durai asking for a hug was completely bizarre, it wasn't any more bizarre than the other bizarre stuff.</font><br>
[Fri May 20 21:53:37 2005] : <B>Rien</B>: <font color='#004040'>I wondered what was up with the 'she's not as tall as you thought she was' thing</font><br>
[Fri May 20 21:53:54 2005] : <B>Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>The real Dorothy is, in fact, high.</font><br>
[Fri May 20 21:53:55 2005] : <B>Rien</B>: <font color='#004040'>becuase Dorothy's always been tall, in comparison to Renate, that doesn't change when someone's down</font><br>
[Fri May 20 21:53:57 2005] : <B>Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>Just elsewhere.</font><br>
[Fri May 20 21:54:19 2005] : <B>Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>Well, may she OD in peace, or something.</font><br>
[Fri May 20 21:54:30 2005] : <B>Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>And the range of Linetta's illusions shows she's been paying good attention, to bring in the Sijan and everything.</font><br>
[Fri May 20 21:54:38 2005] : <B>Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>Quite so.</font><br>
[Fri May 20 21:54:55 2005] : <B>Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>Way to keep Renate off-balance.</font><br>
[Fri May 20 21:55:38 2005] : <B>Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>Okay, time for me to get on to the next thing, as always.</font><br>
[Fri May 20 21:55:39 2005] : <B>Rien</B>: <font color='#004040'>so running Shadow Illusions don't pin back to the one source?</font><br>
[Fri May 20 21:55:47 2005] : <B>Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>Thanks, Alan! Fun game!</font><br>
[Fri May 20 21:55:53 2005] : <B>Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>See you next time!</font><br>
[Fri May 20 21:56:05 2005] : <font color='#ff0000'>Disconnecting from server...</font><br>
