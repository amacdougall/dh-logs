[Sat Nov 27 21:24:36 2004] : <B>Sorel</B>: <font color='#000080'>(Heh)</font><br>
[Sat Nov 27 21:24:46 2004] : <B>Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>She reaches Coris and stops, not quite sure what to offer.</font><br>
[Sat Nov 27 21:25:23 2004] : <B>Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>He takes her in his arms in a long, comforting hug. "Glad you're alive. Stay that way for a few more years, please?"</font><br>
[Sat Nov 27 21:25:31 2004] : <B>Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>"Like, more than the requisite five."</font><br>
[Sat Nov 27 21:25:48 2004] : <B>Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>"I'll try. Er, I've said that before to you, haven't I?"</font><br>
[Sat Nov 27 21:26:06 2004] : <font color='#008000'>** Sorel saves his comments **</font><br>

[Sat Nov 27 21:27:11 2004] : <B>Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>You notice, as he steps back, that he's wearing your handkerchief woven around one shoulder, like an epaulette of rank.</font><br>
[Sat Nov 27 21:27:49 2004] : <B>Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>His eyes flick to it for a moment. "It was necessary. I have discipline to maintain."</font><br>
[Sat Nov 27 21:28:18 2004] : <B>Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>"Now," he adds, punching Gravin in the shoulder, "after hours, off duty, is another matter, right?" But his eyes are still on you, eyebrow arched.</font><br>
[Sat Nov 27 21:28:41 2004] : <B>Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>Gravin and Lehron respond with obligatory "you know it, buddy" and reciprocal arm-punching.</font><br>
[Sat Nov 27 21:28:43 2004] : <B>Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>She sees it, and her eyes light up. For the first time since the Black Forest, she finds the dazzling von Adler smile. "We're not off duty yet. We've got to get our wandering master-of-arms back home."</font><br>

[Sat Nov 27 21:30:23 2004] : <B>Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>Sorry to delay your designs on Coris, but your suicide move gave him second thoughts.</font><br>

[Sat Nov 27 21:30:37 2004] : <B>Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>Don't blame him.</font><br>
[Sat Nov 27 21:30:47 2004] : <B>Sorel</B>: <font color='#000080'>Like "this chick is wacky!"</font><br>

[Sat Nov 27 21:31:38 2004] : <B>Dorothy</B>: <font color='#004040'>D and I played a very satisfying reconciliation scene the other... morning</font><br>

[Sat Nov 27 21:32:06 2004] : <B>Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>yes... somewhat in advance of events, so it may not turn out to be canon</font><br>
[Sat Nov 27 21:32:08 2004] : <B>Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>but we'll see</font><br>
[Sat Nov 27 21:32:20 2004] : <B>Rien</B>: <font color='#004040'>it's good nad fits well so far though</font><br>
[Sat Nov 27 21:32:26 2004] : <B>Matt</B>: <font color='#000080'>I guess when the actual time comes you can just cut and paste</font><br>
[Sat Nov 27 21:32:39 2004] : <B>Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>Well, it depends on whether you want to be involved too.</font><br>
