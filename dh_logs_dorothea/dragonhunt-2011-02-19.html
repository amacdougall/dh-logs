[Sat Feb 19 21:18:38 2011] : <b>(817) Alan</b>: <font color='#612769'>(Or you can send Chenji off with a handshake.)</font><br />
[Sat Feb 19 21:19:09 2011] : <b>(817) Alan</b>: <font color='#612769'>(It was meant as a throwaway while I'm busy being sick, but it's not like it's not fun.)</font><br />
[Sat Feb 19 21:20:37 2011] : <b>(820) Chenji</b>: <font color='#800000'>(Up to you two)</font><br />
[Sat Feb 19 21:21:03 2011] : <b>(815) Renate</b>: <font color='#000080'>(Either way. I'm curious about Brosford, though.)</font><br />

[Sat Feb 19 21:21:27 2011] : <b>(818) Rien</b>: <font color='#263607'>(Yeah, let's let him go)</font><br />
[Sat Feb 19 21:21:35 2011] : <b>(820) Chenji</b>: <font color='#800000'>(heh)</font><br />
[Sat Feb 19 21:23:52 2011] : <b>(820) Chenji</b>: <font color='#800000'>Chenji makes for the portal.  "Thanks, you two.  Couldn't have done it without you.  Well, I could have, but it wouldn't have been as easy.  Say, Renate, you should wear your hair up.  It would look way better than what you're working with, now.  Kind of makes you look like a little kid.  Alright, Rien.  Don't be evil.  See you guys on the other side!"  Chenji jumps in the portal.</font><br />
[Sat Feb 19 21:24:26 2011] : <b>(815) Renate</b>: <font color='#000080'>"He is truly irksome," Renate sighs. "Can we get out of here without being seen?"</font><br />
[Sat Feb 19 21:25:17 2011] : <b>(817) Alan</b>: <font color='#612769'>Right before the portal closes, Renate hears a faint whine, followed by a clicking of claws on stone; there's a brief scramble, and then the portal closes.</font><br />
[Sat Feb 19 21:25:37 2011] : <b>(818) Rien</b>: <font color='#263607'>"I believe so.  Let's at least step back beyond the safety door before Chenji does something wrong and triggers it."</font><br />
[Sat Feb 19 21:25:40 2011] : <b>(817) Alan</b>: <font color='#612769'>Rien didn't hear anything.</font><br />
[Sat Feb 19 21:26:12 2011] : <b>(817) Alan</b>: <font color='#612769'>The residual energy of the planar transit dissipates without incident; the shield door stays up.</font><br />
[Sat Feb 19 21:27:04 2011] : <b>(817) Alan</b>: <font color='#612769'>There is only silence, punctuated by a hum so low Renate is not sure if she's just imagining it: the throbbing might of the power conduit running -- by the map -- from Southpoint, through Gereval, to Parnesse.</font><br />
[Sat Feb 19 21:28:41 2011] : <b>(818) Rien</b>: <font color='#263607'>(Folks, I have to leave)</font><br />
[Sat Feb 19 21:28:57 2011] : <b>(820) Chenji</b>: <font color='#800000'>(Yeah, me too)</font><br />
[Sat Feb 19 21:29:01 2011] : <b>(817) Alan</b>: <font color='#612769'>(We covered all the bases.)</font><br />
[Sat Feb 19 21:29:39 2011] : <b>(820) Chenji</b>: <font color='#800000'>(What to take away from this session, though?  Why are the Spirit Realms in an uproar?)</font><br />

[Sat Feb 19 21:30:36 2011] : <b>(817) Alan</b>: <font color='#612769'>(Oh, it's just Chenji being bad at summoning. I'm not going to try to link it to some larger thing.)</font><br />
[Sat Feb 19 21:30:56 2011] : <b>(820) Chenji</b>: <font color='#800000'>Really?</font><br />
[Sat Feb 19 21:31:14 2011] : <b>(817) Alan</b>: <font color='#612769'>(The unprecedently huge power line passing through Gereval is the part that ties into other events, actually.)</font><br />

[Sat Feb 19 21:32:08 2011] : <b>(820) Chenji</b>: <font color='#800000'>Good thing nobody asked him about the tattoos.  Because I had an uncomfortable story to go along with them.</font><br />
[Sat Feb 19 21:32:23 2011] : <b>(815) Renate</b>: <font color='#000080'>oh dear</font><br />
[Sat Feb 19 21:32:25 2011] : <b>(817) Alan</b>: <font color='#612769'>Well, blowing up the power line would be problematic.</font><br />
