[Sat Jun 11 11:03:22 2011] : <b>(208) Rien</b>: <font color='#263607'>Dude's an archangel... if anyone would really know the True King, it's the highest echelon of angelitude.</font><br />
[Sat Jun 11 11:03:36 2011] : <b>(208) Rien</b>: <font color='#263607'>So since this isn't the True King, there's something more to it.</font><br />
[Sat Jun 11 11:03:45 2011] : <b>(210) Aryk</b>: <font color='#800000'>Yeah, you'd think.  But they probably don't.</font><br />
[Sat Jun 11 11:04:11 2011] : <b>(208) Rien</b>: <font color='#263607'>Well, yeah, the whole "we neither confirm nor deny" act could be to cover up the fact that they have no clue.</font><br />
[Sat Jun 11 11:04:29 2011] : <b>(208) Rien</b>: <font color='#263607'>In fact they usually are.</font><br />
[Sat Jun 11 11:04:51 2011] : <b>(209) Renate</b>: <font color='#000080'>You know, we could spin this as Adam going deep undercover to expose the renegade angel. *g*</font><br />
[Sat Jun 11 11:04:59 2011] : <b>(209) Renate</b>: <font color='#000080'>That's me talking rather than Renate, of course.</font><br />
[Sat Jun 11 11:05:03 2011] : <b>(216) Alan</b>: <font color='#612769'>Hah, good idea!</font><br />
[Sat Jun 11 11:05:05 2011] : <b>(210) Aryk</b>: <font color='#800000'>That's a good idea!</font><br />
[Sat Jun 11 11:05:23 2011] : <b>(210) Aryk</b>: <font color='#800000'>Fits his M.O., too!</font><br />
[Sat Jun 11 11:05:26 2011] : <b>(216) Alan</b>: <font color='#612769'>He got his reputation as a sort of corruption-busting boy detective, after all.</font><br />
[Sat Jun 11 11:05:28 2011] : <b>(208) Rien</b>: <font color='#263607'>Yeah, because they can't read what's in your heart unless they're bound to you.</font><br />
[Sat Jun 11 11:05:40 2011] : <b>(216) Alan</b>: <font color='#612769'>Back when they were all in school together.</font><br />
[Sat Jun 11 11:05:44 2011] : <b>(209) Renate</b>: <font color='#000080'>Though the truth is really almost as good a story.</font><br />
[Sat Jun 11 11:05:57 2011] : <b>(209) Renate</b>: <font color='#000080'>"Got sucked in; got suspicious; got in trouble; found the problem; dealt with it."</font><br />
[Sat Jun 11 11:06:17 2011] : <b>(210) Aryk</b>: <font color='#800000'>Aryk won't let Adam sink for this.</font><br />
[Sat Jun 11 11:06:56 2011] : <b>(208) Rien</b>: <font color='#263607'>Thing is, would Adam be willing to lie and say this was the case?</font><br />
[Sat Jun 11 11:07:07 2011] : <b>(208) Rien</b>: <font color='#263607'>He's always been all about the truth at any cost.</font><br />
[Sat Jun 11 11:07:16 2011] : <b>(209) Renate</b>: <font color='#000080'>Except with regard to himself, sometimes.</font><br />
[Sat Jun 11 11:07:40 2011] : <b>(209) Renate</b>: <font color='#000080'>Again, if he goes for the truth -- which IMO isn't all that prejudicial, honestly! -- Renate will back him to the hilt.</font><br />
[Sat Jun 11 11:07:47 2011] : <b>(216) Alan</b>: <font color='#612769'>There are levels of truth -- he'll lie to get at a bigger truth. But he wouldn't lie to save himself. Saying "I can do more good if I'm free and respected" is too bald a justification.</font><br />
[Sat Jun 11 11:08:18 2011] : <b>(216) Alan</b>: <font color='#612769'>He'll lie to himself, of course -- he's only human. But knowingly is another matter.</font><br />
[Sat Jun 11 11:08:30 2011] : <b>(209) Renate</b>: <font color='#000080'>Yep.</font><br />
[Sat Jun 11 11:09:03 2011] : <b>(209) Renate</b>: <font color='#000080'>I'm afraid Myra's gonna have a shitfit about this.</font><br />
[Sat Jun 11 11:09:42 2011] : <b>(210) Aryk</b>: <font color='#800000'>One thing at a time.  Aryk's going to do something about Myra when he's in a better position to.</font><br />
[Sat Jun 11 11:09:46 2011] : <b>(208) Rien</b>: <font color='#263607'>I assume Emily didn't come with, by the way.</font><br />
[Sat Jun 11 11:09:58 2011] : <b>(209) Renate</b>: <font color='#000080'>No, she didn't.</font><br />
[Sat Jun 11 11:10:00 2011] : <b>(210) Aryk</b>: <font color='#800000'>She's holding down the fort in Carrackshire.</font><br />
[Sat Jun 11 11:10:01 2011] : <b>(208) Rien</b>: <font color='#263607'>She probably wouldn't want ot go to the Sacred Realm.</font><br />
[Sat Jun 11 11:10:04 2011] : <b>(209) Renate</b>: <font color='#000080'>She's heading up Longranger patrols.</font><br />
[Sat Jun 11 11:10:31 2011] : <b>(209) Renate</b>: <font color='#000080'>But this might be the opportunity. I mean, how embarrassing is it to be all down on Myra who never did anything wrong while harboring Zadchiel?</font><br />
[Sat Jun 11 11:10:57 2011] : <b>(210) Aryk</b>: <font color='#800000'>Heh, we said nearly that the last time we were talking about Zadchiel.</font><br />
[Sat Jun 11 11:11:11 2011] : <b>(209) Renate</b>: <font color='#000080'>I'm not surprised!</font><br />
[Sat Jun 11 11:11:35 2011] : <b>(208) Rien</b>: <font color='#263607'>I'm not convinced that Zadchiel has gone renegade, but we'll find out next time, I guess.</font><br />
[Sat Jun 11 11:11:52 2011] : <b>(210) Aryk</b>: <font color='#800000'>If it wasn't for his responsibility to Carrackshire, Aryk would be staying in Gereval when they traveled there.</font><br />
[Sat Jun 11 11:12:30 2011] : <b>(209) Renate</b>: <font color='#000080'>Ren can't stand that place.</font><br />
[Sat Jun 11 11:12:41 2011] : <b>(209) Renate</b>: <font color='#000080'>I mean, she CAN stand it, but she hates it.</font><br />
[Sat Jun 11 11:12:54 2011] : <b>(209) Renate</b>: <font color='#000080'>There is, however, a fair bit of detectoring to be done there.</font><br />
[Sat Jun 11 11:12:59 2011] : <b>(210) Aryk</b>: <font color='#800000'>Yeah, but that's where the College is.</font><br />
[Sat Jun 11 11:13:26 2011] : <b>(209) Renate</b>: <font color='#000080'>Oh, sure. Ren would go to get Adam out of hock, no question.</font><br />
[Sat Jun 11 11:13:57 2011] : <b>(210) Aryk</b>: <font color='#800000'>Where the proverbial tidal wave of change is going to come crashing down.</font><br />
[Sat Jun 11 11:14:17 2011] : <b>(209) Renate</b>: <font color='#000080'>And also, this is Kahan's main chance.</font><br />
[Sat Jun 11 11:14:21 2011] : <b>(209) Renate</b>: <font color='#000080'>But I suppose that was obvious.</font><br />
[Sat Jun 11 11:14:22 2011] : <b>(210) Aryk</b>: <font color='#800000'>Or at least the proverbial equivalent of a Chinese water torture.</font><br />
[Sat Jun 11 11:14:51 2011] : <b>(209) Renate</b>: <font color='#000080'>Emily may have to be the one to carry that banner.</font><br />
[Sat Jun 11 11:15:24 2011] : <b>(210) Aryk</b>: <font color='#800000'>Aryk and her both.  But dammit, Kahan better be open with Aryk about his intentions, otherwise Aryk is going to keep second-guessing himself on that whole issue.</font><br />
[Sat Jun 11 11:15:48 2011] : <b>(210) Aryk</b>: <font color='#800000'>But I digress.  Ima go eat a sandwich.</font><br />
[Sat Jun 11 11:16:10 2011] : <b>(210) Aryk</b>: <font color='#800000'>Oh, by the way, one of these weekends in the near future the wiz and I are going to be out of town.  I'll keep you all posted.</font><br />
[Sat Jun 11 11:16:12 2011] : <b>(208) Rien</b>: <font color='#263607'>I think I might go bang my ear soon.</font><br />
[Sat Jun 11 11:16:28 2011] : <b>(210) Aryk</b>: <font color='#800000'>Bang your ear?</font><br />
[Sat Jun 11 11:16:46 2011] : <b>(216) Alan</b>: <font color='#612769'>Oh yeah! I almost forgot.</font><br />
[Sat Jun 11 11:17:03 2011] : <b>(216) Alan</b>: <font color='#612769'>Next weekend I can't play -- going to go do all kinds of outdoorsy stuff instead.</font><br />
[Sat Jun 11 11:17:18 2011] : <b>(208) Rien</b>: <font color='#263607'>Bang your ear = sleep</font><br />
[Sat Jun 11 11:17:21 2011] : <b>(216) Alan</b>: <font color='#612769'>But this is actually pretty straightforward from here, for a bit, so I can write a DM packet.</font><br />

[Sat Jun 11 11:17:46 2011] : <b>(210) Aryk</b>: <font color='#800000'>You go do that.  Go sleep.  </font><br />
[Sat Jun 11 11:17:59 2011] : <b>(209) Renate</b>: <font color='#000080'>OK, Alan, send me teh packet and I'll run.</font><br />
