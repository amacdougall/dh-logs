[Sat Sep 25 18:23:12 2010] : <b>(3387) Alan</b>: <font color='#3d0079'>Randall's charm has already taken effect: the drug dealer who was sitting at one end of the thicket, and the teen lovers who were canoodling at the other, have picked up a feeling of restlessness and decided to head elsewhere.</font><br />

[Sat Sep 25 20:59:41 2010] : <b>(3399) Alan</b>: <font color='#3d0079'>Okay. That is in fact what happens -- the flatiron stops radiating magic, and Randall's spell has no effect, but he's still safe behind his shield.</font><br />
[Sat Sep 25 21:00:28 2010] : <b>(3399) Alan</b>: <font color='#3d0079'>And now Leonid Tarraquene jumps down from the far rooftop, landing on a gentle cushion of air. Sabra almost doesn't recognize him without his huge steelbound spellbook.</font><br />

[Sat Sep 25 21:04:33 2010] : <b>(3399) Alan</b>: <font color='#3d0079'>Nice. The weakness spell works this time, and the agent falls to his knees, sword dropping from his hands.</font><br />
[Sat Sep 25 21:04:53 2010] : <b>(3399) Alan</b>: <font color='#3d0079'>He manages to lift his potion gauntlet to his lips, and instantly recovers, picking his sword back up.</font><br />

[Sat Sep 25 21:05:27 2010] : <b>(3386) Randall</b>: <font color='#263607'>TO which Randall's response would be to weaken him again.  "I can keep this up all day, you know."</font><br />
[Sat Sep 25 21:05:45 2010] : <b>(3399) Alan</b>: <font color='#3d0079'>Leonid picks one of Sabra's assailants off with a hail of lightning bolts.</font><br />

[Sat Sep 25 21:08:37 2010] : <b>(3399) Alan</b>: <font color='#3d0079'>Excellent. The Hell agents are off balance from Leonid's whirlwind and attacks; Sabra is able to stick one of them with some more arrows.</font><br />

He falls like a meteor, smashing into a defensive formation of three agents with a shield of rock and fire.

[Sat Sep 25 21:10:51 2010] : <b>(3399) Alan</b>: <font color='#3d0079'>The Hell agent confronting Randall realizes he's at an impasse, and goes for another of those tubes of blinding powder, which does have the benefit of going through the golden shield.</font><br />
[Sat Sep 25 21:10:59 2010] : <b>(3383) Sabra</b>: <font color='#000080'>"Oh, for fuck's sake, shut UP." Sabra spins low to take an agent's leg out from under -- her, as it turns out.</font><br />
[Sat Sep 25 21:12:10 2010] : <b>(3399) Alan</b>: <font color='#3d0079'>"And worst of all, I have come to realize that everything I endured was due to my own failings... and I came up after that blow as well!" Templeton intercepts an agent who was angling for a backstab on Leonid, turning the agent from a barely perceptible blur into two barely perceptible blurs.</font><br />
[Sat Sep 25 21:12:15 2010] : <b>(3386) Randall</b>: <font color='#263607'>And the shield of light turns to a shield of fire as Randall calls upon the Grace of Michael.  Burn that powder to ash.</font><br />
[Sat Sep 25 21:12:49 2010] : <b>(3399) Alan</b>: <font color='#3d0079'>"So tell me... what do I have to fear from Hell?" Leonid summons a whirlwind which flings the last agent easily a kilometer into the air.</font><br />
[Sat Sep 25 21:13:01 2010] : <b>(3399) Alan</b>: <font color='#3d0079'>All that's left are the one facing Randall and the one Sabra just knocked down.</font><br />
[Sat Sep 25 21:13:46 2010] : <b>(3399) Alan</b>: <font color='#3d0079'>Randall blocks the blinding powder with the fire shield, definitely.</font><br />
[Sat Sep 25 21:13:47 2010] : <b>(3383) Sabra</b>: <font color='#000080'>Sabra'll knife hers. Pretty soon her cherubs will be getting busy.</font><br />
[Sat Sep 25 21:15:30 2010] : <b>(3399) Alan</b>: <font color='#3d0079'>Templeton runs past the defensive line of angels, bearing down on the agent fighting Randall. That agent has recovered his strength again, and after dodging a swing of Templeton's axe, fades from view.</font><br />
[Sat Sep 25 21:16:33 2010] : <b>(3399) Alan</b>: <font color='#3d0079'>Templeton spins his axe overhead, playing another hymn which (as Sabra knows) should slow down every enemy nearby. The faded agent becomes more visible -- a moving blur heading away toward the north.</font><br />
[Sat Sep 25 21:17:30 2010] : <b>(3399) Alan</b>: <font color='#3d0079'>Leonid flies after him, blanketing the area in fire. Randall can tell that he's burning through his mana reserves pretty fast, but he can't tell how well he's doing.</font><br />
[Sat Sep 25 21:17:49 2010] : <b>(3383) Sabra</b>: <font color='#000080'>Hee hee. Can Sabra charge up and still hit this creep before he's out of range? Without getting killed by the one she just dropped?</font><br />
[Sat Sep 25 21:18:37 2010] : <b>(3399) Alan</b>: <font color='#3d0079'>Templeton's going to run around making sure all the fallen enemies are dead and stay dead. As an Urielite paladin, he can take a second over a body to "freeze" it in death.</font><br />
[Sat Sep 25 21:18:52 2010] : <b>(3399) Alan</b>: <font color='#3d0079'>It takes a full-on resurrection spell to counteract it.</font><br />
[Sat Sep 25 21:19:06 2010] : <b>(3383) Sabra</b>: <font color='#000080'>Good plan.</font><br />
[Sat Sep 25 21:19:18 2010] : <b>(3383) Sabra</b>: <font color='#000080'>If they can just be kept down for five minutes, that's very helpful.</font><br />
[Sat Sep 25 21:19:35 2010] : <b>(3399) Alan</b>: <font color='#3d0079'>The agent has got fire resistance up; Sabra figures they went in without magical defenses, to avoid detection, but started putting them up during the fight. That's SOP.</font><br />
[Sat Sep 25 21:20:13 2010] : <b>(3399) Alan</b>: <font color='#3d0079'>She can definitely shoot him; Leonid's on him, too, trying one element after another. Earth ends up working; Leonid just clobbers him with a catapult blast of rocks.</font><br />
[Sat Sep 25 21:20:50 2010] : <b>(3386) Randall</b>: <font color='#263607'>Once they're all down and staying down, unmask them.  See if any of them look familiar.</font><br />
[Sat Sep 25 21:20:55 2010] : <b>(3399) Alan</b>: <font color='#3d0079'>The agent goes face down in a field of scorched, frozen, and rubble-strewn cobblestones.</font><br />
[Sat Sep 25 21:20:58 2010] : <b>(3386) Randall</b>: <font color='#263607'>We need the angelic version of a camera, dammit.</font><br />
[Sat Sep 25 21:21:13 2010] : <b>(3383) Sabra</b>: <font color='#000080'>Sabra is trained to remember faces, I'm sure.</font><br />
[Sat Sep 25 21:21:43 2010] : <b>(3383) Sabra</b>: <font color='#000080'>And that's a VERY good idea, by the way.</font><br />
[Sat Sep 25 21:21:47 2010] : <b>(3399) Alan</b>: <font color='#3d0079'>Nope; they're all just people. Six men, three women, in all, ranging from 20 to 40.</font><br />
[Sat Sep 25 21:21:48 2010] : <b>(3386) Randall</b>: <font color='#263607'>Well, being able to put names to these faces could help unravel the cloak of mystery over Hell.</font><br />
[Sat Sep 25 21:23:03 2010] : <b>(3399) Alan</b>: <font color='#3d0079'>A black stain begins to spread across their faces, roughly in order of their deaths. The skin becomes black and dry, and then they begin to crumble slowly to dust.</font><br />
[Sat Sep 25 21:23:18 2010] : <b>(3386) Randall</b>: <font color='#263607'>(Final death is final)</font><br />
[Sat Sep 25 21:23:21 2010] : <b>(3399) Alan</b>: <font color='#3d0079'>"We've got to get out of here," Earnest says, horrified.</font><br />
[Sat Sep 25 21:23:46 2010] : <b>(3386) Randall</b>: <font color='#263607'>Can Randall stop it?</font><br />
[Sat Sep 25 21:23:50 2010] : <b>(3383) Sabra</b>: <font color='#000080'>Don't bother.</font><br />
[Sat Sep 25 21:23:52 2010] : <b>(3399) Alan</b>: <font color='#3d0079'>Templeton says, "Yes. To the ship. Leonid, I thank you from the bottom of my heart for your help. Does this mean you are now aligned against Dark Eternal?"</font><br />
[Sat Sep 25 21:24:12 2010] : <b>(3399) Alan</b>: <font color='#3d0079'>"Yes," Leonid says. "I have a lot to make up for."</font><br />
[Sat Sep 25 21:24:26 2010] : <b>(3383) Sabra</b>: <font color='#000080'>We need to vamoose, leaving Sabra's cherubs behind to distract anybody else who shows up.</font><br />
[Sat Sep 25 21:24:58 2010] : <b>(3399) Alan</b>: <font color='#3d0079'>Even if people ignore the cherubs (who are stealthed anyway unless you choose not to), Sabra can at least see if something's coming.</font><br />
[Sat Sep 25 21:25:17 2010] : <b>(3399) Alan</b>: <font color='#3d0079'>Anyway, you can hear alarm-bells not too far off. Definitely time to go.</font><br />
[Sat Sep 25 21:25:20 2010] : <b>(3383) Sabra</b>: <font color='#000080'>Yep, we should do that -- and stealth is fine, but buildings going boom is not exactly stealthy.</font><br />
[Sat Sep 25 21:25:35 2010] : <b>(3399) Alan</b>: <font color='#3d0079'>Oh, good point! It's about time....</font><br />
[Sat Sep 25 21:25:52 2010] : <b>(3399) Alan</b>: <font color='#3d0079'>The status has turned entirely to lead, and now a shimmering blue portal opens...</font><br />
[Sat Sep 25 21:26:21 2010] : <b>(3383) Sabra</b>: <font color='#000080'>Besides, Our Heroes vamoosing before a curtain of crumbling buildings -- it's very cinematic!</font><br />
[Sat Sep 25 21:26:26 2010] : <b>(3399) Alan</b>: <font color='#3d0079'>...and in a steady stream comes a heavenly stampede of armor-plated golden oxen with glowing blue eyes.</font><br />
[Sat Sep 25 21:27:11 2010] : <b>(3399) Alan</b>: <font color='#3d0079'>They charge immediately at the nearest man-made structure they can see, crashing through warehouse walls, uprooting support pillars, throwing themselves through windows.</font><br />
[Sat Sep 25 21:27:49 2010] : <b>(3399) Alan</b>: <font color='#3d0079'>When it's just three or four oxen, the effect is comedic; but once over two dozen are on the scene, it quickly becomes clear that the entire city block is about to get torn to rubble.</font><br />
[Sat Sep 25 21:28:52 2010] : <b>(3399) Alan</b>: <font color='#3d0079'>"Quick, we're casting off immediately," Kleinfelt says as you pour onto the boat; and not a moment too soon, because the harbormaster and his police squad are already running down to see what the racket is. When they see the stampede of heavenly oxen, they're too astonished to notice Kleinfelt's boat before it's a hundred meters out to the harbor.</font><br />
[Sat Sep 25 21:29:31 2010] : <b>(3399) Alan</b>: <font color='#3d0079'>There's a blockade, of course, blocking the way out; but no matter. Summoning the power of Ariodant, Lord of the Seas, Kleinfelt causes the entire ship to submerge in a magical bubble of air, and cruise invisibly out to sea.</font><br />
