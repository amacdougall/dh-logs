[Sun Jan  1 19:12:42 2006] : <B>(1) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>The nearest town is Cordelus Green, on the shores of Lake Cordelus, at the edge of the Timbers.</font><br>
[Sun Jan  1 19:12:54 2006] : <B>(3) Tancred</B>: <font color='#000080'>Right-ho, then.</font><br>
[Sun Jan  1 19:13:30 2006] : <B>(1) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>It's a tangle of boom-town slums and miniature mansions that has grown up around the original carefully-planned core of offices, government buildings, and corporate residences.</font><br>
[Sun Jan  1 19:14:14 2006] : <B>(3) Tancred</B>: <font color='#000080'>Church? Law enforcement?</font><br>

[Sun Jan  1 19:17:26 2006] : <B>(1) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>Since the city is run by the Lakaira Group, a corporation/state headed by its dragon owner Katedona, it's safe to assume the law enforcement, the government, and the main office buildings are all one.</font><br>
[Sun Jan  1 19:17:57 2006] : <B>(3) Tancred</B>: <font color='#000080'>What time of day is it when we get there?</font><br>
[Sun Jan  1 19:18:51 2006] : <B>(1) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>Jusgaarde mentioned that the real power in Lakaira rests with the Hekkruns; to which the sergeant replied, "Dragon first. Human second."</font><br>

[Sun Jan  1 19:19:13 2006] : <B>(1) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>The attack was early in the day; so it's a bit after noon after all the running.</font><br>

[Sun Jan  1 19:20:34 2006] : <B>(3) Tancred</B>: <font color='#000080'>Once or twice, the purple glow that is Yewey appears to whisper in Sashi's ear.</font><br>
[Sun Jan  1 19:21:05 2006] : <font color='#008000'>** (2) Sashi tries several differet grips as she drags Arno along behind her, finally settling for a tight grip on his hair **</font><br>
[Sun Jan  1 19:21:23 2006] : <B>(1) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>"Nice weather," Arno grumbles. The aftermath of the artificial hurricane has been buffeting gusts of wind and rain.</font><br>
[Sun Jan  1 19:21:42 2006] : <B>(1) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>He's been fading in and out of consciousness.</font><br>
[Sun Jan  1 19:22:18 2006] : <B>(3) Tancred</B>: <font color='#000080'>An evil look is all the answer Arno gets from Tancred.</font><br>
[Sun Jan  1 19:22:53 2006] : <B>(1) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>From the forest, it looked like no more than a few kilometers to the city; but distances out on the plains are deceptive to someone accustomed to city streets.</font><br>
[Sun Jan  1 19:23:32 2006] : <B>(3) Tancred</B>: <font color='#000080'>Tancred's wrist is throbbing and he is in an evil humor, but he grits his teeth and marches on.</font><br>
[Sun Jan  1 19:23:56 2006] : <B>(2) Sashi</B>: <font color='#004040'>Sashi narrows her eyes, trying to judge their remaining distance</font><br>
[Sun Jan  1 19:24:14 2006] : <B>(1) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>As you draw nearer, you can see roads running from the city toward the Timbers; there are occasional caravans, drawn by yak-like beasts of burden, traveling in either direction, bearing either loads of packages from the city, or loads of raw wood or stone toward it.</font><br>
[Sun Jan  1 19:24:33 2006] : <B>(1) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>It might be easier to meet the road and try to hitch a ride.</font><br>
[Sun Jan  1 19:24:46 2006] : <B>(3) Tancred</B>: <font color='#000080'>Sure, we'll do that.</font><br>
[Sun Jan  1 19:25:06 2006] : <B>(3) Tancred</B>: <font color='#000080'>Tancred doesn't want Sashi wearing out all her strength dragging Arno.</font><br>
[Sun Jan  1 19:25:51 2006] : <B>(1) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>The road at first looks like just a packed-earth trail, but on closer examination, it's a path of something quite similar to Andragar's streetweave; the grasses here have been convinced to mat and knit themselves into a resilient surface.</font><br>
[Sun Jan  1 19:26:29 2006] : <B>(1) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>Twin metal rails run along it, embedded in the grass so that foot traffic has no trouble.</font><br>
[Sun Jan  1 19:27:27 2006] : <font color='#008000'>** (3) Tancred trips over the slight ridge and curses violently. **</font><br>
[Sun Jan  1 19:27:42 2006] : <B>(1) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>A particularly large convoy is coming from the west, behind you, from the Timbers&#8212;not from the part that was just hit with a tornado, of course.</font><br>
[Sun Jan  1 19:27:50 2006] : <B>(1) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>(Okay, almost no trouble.)</font><br>
[Sun Jan  1 19:28:05 2006] : <B>(3) Tancred</B>: <font color='#000080'>(He's tired.)</font><br>
[Sun Jan  1 19:28:41 2006] : <B>(1) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>It's guarded; one of the advance riders flows up on some sort of low-slinking cat/fox hybrid.</font><br>
[Sun Jan  1 19:29:37 2006] : <B>(3) Tancred</B>: <font color='#000080'>"Yewey, I'll need help with this," Tancred murmurs.</font><br>
[Sun Jan  1 19:29:41 2006] : <B>(1) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>"Good day!" Yewey translates. "You look like a demon vomited on you! {Idiom translation: translation aborted. Error message: meaning is obvious.}"</font><br>
[Sun Jan  1 19:30:01 2006] : <B>(3) Tancred</B>: <font color='#000080'>"Not so far off. Could we have a ride into town?"</font><br>
[Sun Jan  1 19:30:37 2006] : <B>(1) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>The rider looks half concerned, half amused. "You went into the Timbers with just you three? You are fortunate to be alive."</font><br>
[Sun Jan  1 19:30:56 2006] : <B>(3) Tancred</B>: <font color='#000080'>"We hadn't much choice in the matter."</font><br>
[Sun Jan  1 19:31:12 2006] : <B>(2) Sashi</B>: <font color='#004040'>*We were a much bigger group when we went in,* Sashi signs with her free hand.</font><br>
[Sun Jan  1 19:31:49 2006] : <B>(3) Tancred</B>: <font color='#000080'>Tancred almost laughs. They are a trio, aren't they? He with his useless wrist, mute Sashi, and half-conscious Arno. At least their alibi will stand up to observation!</font><br>
[Sun Jan  1 19:31:51 2006] : <B>(1) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>"{lacuna} if you don't, right? Hey! boss! Three people here, two wounded, need a ride in. We have a space?"</font><br>
[Sun Jan  1 19:33:12 2006] : <B>(1) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>The driver of the first wagon grunts something affirmative. The wagons themselves are an intriguing piece of work; designed solely for traveling these rails between Lakaira depots and the Timbers, they have sails as well as animal teams.</font><br>
[Sun Jan  1 19:33:36 2006] : <B>(1) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>Right now, the sails are cautiously rigged, so that the upredictable wind won't tip them over.</font><br>
[Sun Jan  1 19:34:23 2006] : <B>(1) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>The outrider dismounts to help Sashi lift Arno up onto the back of one of the wagonbeds, propping him up between chunks of quarried stone.</font><br>
[Sun Jan  1 19:34:59 2006] : <font color='#008000'>** (3) Tancred climbs into the rig behind him, leaving space for Sashi to sit beside. **</font><br>
[Sun Jan  1 19:35:19 2006] : <B>(1) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>"Funny accent you have there," he comments. "Is that a {speech-changing-understand-box}?"</font><br>
[Sun Jan  1 19:35:42 2006] : <B>(3) Tancred</B>: <font color='#000080'>"Not quite. Does just as well as."</font><br>
[Sun Jan  1 19:35:52 2006] : <B>(3) Tancred</B>: <font color='#000080'>"Are you in?" he whispers to Sashi.</font><br>
[Sun Jan  1 19:36:19 2006] : <B>(2) Sashi</B>: <font color='#004040'>Sashi sees him arranged in place, then hops up into the wagon-bed, suatting down rather than sitting, alert as they ride these unfamiliar contraptions.  She nods at Tancred, making no other sign</font><br>
[Sun Jan  1 19:36:49 2006] : <B>(1) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>"Well, it is very good. Most {added: "translators"} just have twenty or so phrases."</font><br>
[Sun Jan  1 19:36:53 2006] : <B>(3) Tancred</B>: <font color='#000080'>"When I say," Tancred whispers back, and says no more.</font><br>
[Sun Jan  1 19:37:11 2006] : <B>(3) Tancred</B>: <font color='#000080'>"There you are, Yewey. Note that in 'compliments' file."</font><br>
[Sun Jan  1 19:37:18 2006] : <B>(1) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>"Are you a visiting mage too?" The outrider walks along behind the wagon, which is traveling at no more than a brisk walk.</font><br>
[Sun Jan  1 19:37:51 2006] : <B>(3) Tancred</B>: <font color='#000080'>"I am a mage, and I appear to be visiting," answers Tancred, his patience worn thin.</font><br>

[Sun Jan  1 19:39:06 2006] : <B>(1) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>"Maybe there is a message I should be riding ahead with?"</font><br>
[Sun Jan  1 19:39:27 2006] : <B>(3) Tancred</B>: <font color='#000080'>"No, not at the moment.</font><br>

[Sun Jan  1 19:40:43 2006] : <font color='#008000'>** (3) Tancred slumps against the side of the wagon, his own consciousness fading. **</font><br>
[Sun Jan  1 19:42:18 2006] : <B>(1) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>You're jolted awake an indeterminate time later by a sudden shift in the wagon; it's going through a series of switches.</font><br>
[Sun Jan  1 19:42:29 2006] : <B>(1) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>The sun has moved a bit; it's mid-afternoon.</font><br>
[Sun Jan  1 19:43:02 2006] : <B>(1) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>You're in the outermost city limits; it's fairly domesticated here, and the weather has calmed down enough for a schoolyard to be full of children playing some sort of stickball.</font><br>
[Sun Jan  1 19:43:06 2006] : <font color='#008000'>** (3) Tancred blinks sand out of his eyes and gets to his knees to peer over the wagonload toward the city. **</font><br>
[Sun Jan  1 19:43:29 2006] : <B>(1) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>No, on second glance, there is no ball; they're just hitting one another with sticks. Sports at its most literal prototype.</font><br>
[Sun Jan  1 19:43:51 2006] : <B>(3) Tancred</B>: <font color='#000080'>Ouch. Tancred begins to wonder if... no, it must.</font><br>
[Sun Jan  1 19:46:06 2006] : <B>(1) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>The housing and nearly everything else here give an impression of ad hoc utility. The caravan driver waves his hands and says "The butterfly is eaten by the hawk. {Idiom: Something to do with an ending?}"</font><br>
[Sun Jan  1 19:46:25 2006] : <B>(3) Tancred</B>: <font color='#000080'>"Good meal. Thanks. Hey, Arno!"</font><br>
[Sun Jan  1 19:46:48 2006] : <B>(1) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>The wagons are entering a sort of lock, one by one, in which they're jacking up on their axels and their metal train-wheels are replaced with rubber-coated street wheels.</font><br>
[Sun Jan  1 19:47:27 2006] : <B>(1) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>"Reminds me of home," he says. (I don't remember; is he tied up or something?)</font><br>

[Sun Jan  1 19:48:51 2006] : <B>(3) Tancred</B>: <font color='#000080'>"No," Tancred says grimly.</font><br>
