[Sat Aug  1 00:53:24 2009] : <b>(1775) Alan</b>: <font color='#000080'>Old Wolf does shake his head a bit now, a bit amused to see his advice taken so abruptly to heart.</font><br />

[Sat Aug  1 00:57:33 2009] : <b>(1777) Renate</b>: <font color='#000080'>"We'll discuss it later," Renate overrides.</font><br />

[Sat Aug  1 00:58:26 2009] : <b>(1779) Aryk</b>: <font color='#710000'>"Okay then.  I'm listening."</font><br />
[Sat Aug  1 00:59:19 2009] : <b>(1777) Renate</b>: <font color='#000080'>"You made a mistake in a high-stakes situation," says Renate calmly. "All right. I've done that. Rien has done that. Master Yulias might even admit to it."</font><br />
[Sat Aug  1 00:59:59 2009] : <b>(1775) Alan</b>: <font color='#000080'>"Seldom that I haven't," he owns.</font><br />

[Sat Aug  1 01:01:16 2009] : <b>(1777) Renate</b>: <font color='#000080'>She grins. "Well spotted."</font><br />

[Sat Aug  1 01:04:45 2009] : <b>(1777) Renate</b>: <font color='#000080'>"Aryk, part of my work is to marshal resources, to judge what I need for the work I have to do. I tell you quite honestly that you are an asset, and an important one, and an <em>irreplaceable</em> one. So yes, let us come to an arrangement."</font><br />
[Sat Aug  1 01:06:20 2009] : <b>(1779) Aryk</b>: <font color='#710000'>"Now you're trying logic on me," Aryk mumbles.  "Okay, I... stay on... until we settle this... issue.  In the meantime, you have to increase your teaching the 'thinking hard' to me."</font><br />
[Sat Aug  1 01:06:57 2009] : <b>(1777) Renate</b>: <font color='#000080'>"Very well, I agree. And should we come across opportunities for more such training, I am happy for you to avail yourself of them."</font><br />

[Sat Aug  1 01:08:14 2009] : <b>(1777) Renate</b>: <font color='#000080'>"It means that you do them." She smiles. "My brother," she adds, less formally, "I know you can think. You've surprised me at it more than once. What you need is to <em>believe</em> that you can; and that I will do my best to give you."</font><br />
[Sat Aug  1 01:09:17 2009] : <b>(1779) Aryk</b>: <font color='#710000'>"Well, you know best.  Thank you, Rennie."</font><br />
[Sat Aug  1 01:09:17 2009] : <b>(1777) Renate</b>: <font color='#000080'>"Because if you believe it, you'll rely on that belief."</font><br />
[Sat Aug  1 01:09:46 2009] : <b>(1779) Aryk</b>: <font color='#710000'>"Oh, and I'm also to really figure out what I believe in, too, so that's good."</font><br />
[Sat Aug  1 01:10:06 2009] : <b>(1777) Renate</b>: <font color='#000080'>"I know well enough. I ought, by now. Gentlemen and ladies -- Papa, if you'll forgive me -- a toast! To our paladin, Sir Aryk Lazarus; long may he live, and long prosper!"</font><br />
[Sat Aug  1 01:10:40 2009] : <b>(1775) Alan</b>: <font color='#000080'>"So," Daniel says, after the toast. "Old Wolf, I believe you said you could still play the banjo?"</font><br />
[Sat Aug  1 01:11:10 2009] : <b>(1775) Alan</b>: <font color='#000080'>"Rusty as an old gate, but I expect I could coax a few notes out of one... you're going to tell me you have one close to hand?"</font><br />
[Sat Aug  1 01:11:24 2009] : <b>(1777) Renate</b>: <font color='#000080'>"One can be found. Daniel, if you will?"</font><br />
[Sat Aug  1 01:11:39 2009] : <b>(1775) Alan</b>: <font color='#000080'>"Look where you are, sir. If you cannot find a banjo in Karlbotel, you cannot find one in the world."</font><br />
[Sat Aug  1 01:11:41 2009] : <b>(1777) Renate</b>: <font color='#000080'>She steps to Old Wolf's side, prepared for that conversation.</font><br />
