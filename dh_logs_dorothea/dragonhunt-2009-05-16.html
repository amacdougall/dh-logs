[Sat May 16 01:02:36 2009] : <b>(26819) Alan</b>: <font color='#000080'>"I defer to the judgment of the honorable War Minister, your Majesty," Rousseau says readily. "His words are wise."</font><br />
[Sat May 16 01:03:15 2009] : <b>(26820) The Empress</b>: <font color='#000080'>It is the proper thing to say; but Viviana is somehow obscurely disappointed.</font><br />
[Sat May 16 01:03:19 2009] : <b>(26819) Alan</b>: <font color='#000080'>"Indeed they are," replies the Emperor, "but if you have some additional insight, let us hear it."</font><br />
[Sat May 16 01:03:21 2009] : <b>(26822) Noemi</b>: <font color='#710000'>Like Hell you do.</font><br />
[Sat May 16 01:04:40 2009] : <b>(26819) Alan</b>: <font color='#000080'>Rousseau nods. "While reserving the possibility of a draft, your Majesty, I believe we could do much by investing in so-called 'force multipliers' -- techniques and equipment which enhances the effectiveness of existing personnel."</font><br />
[Sat May 16 01:05:23 2009] : <b>(26819) Alan</b>: <font color='#000080'>"Of course, we have already done so, to a huge degree -- our defense grid, our flying castles, our new magics." He nods at Pascal and Laurent in turn.</font><br />
[Sat May 16 01:06:02 2009] : <b>(26819) Alan</b>: <font color='#000080'>"If we accelerate the pace of research and development, we may be able to stay ahead even if the tide of numbers turns against us."</font><br />
[Sat May 16 01:06:33 2009] : <b>(26819) Alan</b>: <font color='#000080'>He gives a quick bow to indicate that his answer is complete. He rattled it off almost like a self-conscious schoolboy; quite the right tone for addressing the Emperor, one would think.</font><br />
[Sat May 16 01:06:34 2009] : <b>(26822) Noemi</b>: <font color='#710000'>Of course he's right.  Damn him.</font><br />
[Sat May 16 01:07:36 2009] : <b>(26819) Alan</b>: <font color='#000080'>"Indeed... you and High Master Laurent have been cooking up quite a few new dishes, have you not?"</font><br />
[Sat May 16 01:08:04 2009] : <b>(26819) Alan</b>: <font color='#000080'>"Yes, Your Majesty. The honorable High Master is a brilliant mind, and I am humbled to assist him."</font><br />
[Sat May 16 01:09:15 2009] : <b>(26815) Tristan Laurent</b>: <font color='#003300'>"No need to be so modest about it, my dear Rousseau.  Your contributions have been invaluable.  Using tachyons to send the results of a spell back in time was unprecidented."</font><br />
[Sat May 16 01:11:18 2009] : <b>(26819) Alan</b>: <font color='#000080'>"The Lord-Major is an inventor of spells as well?" the Emperor asks with some surprise.</font><br />
[Sat May 16 01:12:13 2009] : <b>(26815) Tristan Laurent</b>: <font color='#003300'>"We were juggling ideas around, your Majesty, and Rousseau here simply blurted out the most inspired idea I'd heard all day.  It brought all the research together."</font><br />
[Sat May 16 01:12:43 2009] : <b>(26819) Alan</b>: <font color='#000080'>"Not at all, Your Majesty. Often the High Master, or his student Clerk Raleigh, will come to me full of ideas, and as they talk to me, they figure out more about what is in their mind. I am a conversationl blackboard, nothing more." He seems embarassed.</font><br />
[Sat May 16 01:13:20 2009] : <b>(26819) Alan</b>: <font color='#000080'>"I ask questions because, naturally, it is all beyond me." He shrugs as if to say, mages! What can you do?</font><br />
[Sat May 16 01:14:15 2009] : <b>(26819) Alan</b>: <font color='#000080'>"I might suggest something, not knowing it is impossible, but that is out of ignorance. If it turns out that High Master Laurent can <i>make</i> it possible, the genius is all his."</font><br />
[Sat May 16 01:15:03 2009] : <b>(26819) Alan</b>: <font color='#000080'>The Emperor likes this. He laughs and claps Laurent on the shoulder. "A worthy foil, eh? Seems a shame to keep him away from you."</font><br />
[Sat May 16 01:16:26 2009] : <b>(26819) Alan</b>: <font color='#000080'>A week later, Kenneth Raleigh was assigned as head of the assault mages of the Imperial Strikers. Even Laurent was never able to learn why he resigned his clerkship; the Council mages and their clerks, career politicians all, drew a veil of silence.</font><br />
[Sat May 16 01:17:33 2009] : <b>(26815) Tristan Laurent</b>: <font color='#003300'>Didn't stop him from trying to find out, though.  If there's one thing Tristan hates it's knowledge withheld.</font><br />
[Sat May 16 01:17:52 2009] : <b>(26819) Alan</b>: <font color='#000080'><hr /></font><br />

[Sat May 16 01:18:47 2009] : <b>(26819) Alan</b>: <font color='#000080'>More spirits go neutral or switch sides, more battles are won with higher stakes, and factions emerge within the elves, though not yet warring.</font><br />

[Sat May 16 01:21:21 2009] : <b>(26822) Noemi</b>: <font color='#710000'>Okay, then.  Well, until next we meet.</font><br />
