The palace wall is nothing more than a decorative steel lattice, designed to hold the snow and ice of Sune in pleasing patterns; but none of the gathered demonstrators, human or goblin, has shown any urge to climb it.</font><br>

[Fri Sep 29 19:16:58 2006] : <B>(3) Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>(And it was turning out to be a totally standard labor demonstration.)</font><br>
[Fri Sep 29 19:17:24 2006] : <B>(1) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>Instead, they are gathered, organized in camps, watched over by Fernando de Santos y So&ntilde;ero, the Raphaelites, and no doubt by hidden bards&#8212;if Shadow-watcher's plan extends that far.

[Fri Sep 29 19:17:59 2006] : <B>(1) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>I think you've been told that if Shadow-watcher is involved with this, it would be through a dragon called Skybreaker; but you would only have heard the name, no more.</font><br>

[Fri Sep 29 19:19:06 2006] : <B>(1) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>(Of demonstrators? Because you also know that Genjiro Hideki is arriving in the city tonight, and will report to "his commander" in the morning...)</font><br>
[Fri Sep 29 19:19:40 2006] : <B>(3) Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>(Unclear.)</font><br>
[Fri Sep 29 19:19:42 2006] : <B>(1) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>(This is intentionally vague terminology, as the common-tongue newspapers explain. Traditionally Genjiro would have no "commander," but would report to his "lord" the king.)</font><br>

[Fri Sep 29 19:20:55 2006] : <B>(1) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>So one would assume. As for Sakade and Kifura, well, that's the most information Rien could get from the book. Rien does get the impression the book was meant to address goblins, not humans&#8212;its language is meant to add to the obscurity, not take it away.</font><br>
[Fri Sep 29 19:21:07 2006] : <B>(1) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>Therefore, perhaps there's a cultural reference.</font><br>

[Fri Sep 29 19:24:13 2006] : <B>(1) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>(Okay, so you're back south in Vollis proper.)</font><br>
[Fri Sep 29 19:24:25 2006] : <B>(3) Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>(Yes. Went there in the evening, slept there.)</font><br>
[Fri Sep 29 19:24:54 2006] : <B>(2) Aryk</B>: <font color='#000080'>Aryk kicks back.  "Rennie, isn't that successor guy the one you schooled with an oyster fork?"</font><br>

[Fri Sep 29 20:29:46 2006] : <B>(1) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>The guards have halberds, but they don't look like the type to cross them ceremonially; instead, the human one (a giant of a man, bulkier than most of the hobgoblins), takes a posture of exaggerated immobility astride the small gate that leads into the curtained-off box.</font><br>
[Fri Sep 29 20:30:38 2006] : <B>(1) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>"Your highness," he says, "we are honored by your presence. Please allow a moment as the duke is notified of your presence."</font><br>
[Fri Sep 29 20:31:32 2006] : <B>(1) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>A goblin in rich robes scurries up to the gate and peers at Rien through a monocle; Rien notices him adjust some very finely-worked slide controls along its heavy rim. Likely a magical device.</font><br>
[Fri Sep 29 20:32:07 2006] : <B>(1) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>The goblin bows and lets the monocle drop into a vest pocket. "Your highness," he says with a sweeping bow; and at this, the guards open the gate with great deference.</font><br>

[Fri Sep 29 20:40:25 2006] : <B>(1) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>The count seems inclined to agree, but the duke interrupts his uxorious reply with a dry laugh; literally dry, he sounds as though he is suffering a bout of bronchitis.</font><br>

[Fri Sep 29 20:43:17 2006] : <B>(1) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>The count's hand-waving brings out servants bearing delicacies; and as you sample them, he and the Baron of the Falls attempt to interest you in the commercial and cultural progress of the city.</font><br>

[Fri Sep 29 20:43:54 2006] : <B>(1) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>The lesser nobles love this sentiment, and agree heartily, providing copious examples.</font><br>
[Fri Sep 29 20:44:03 2006] : <B>(1) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>(Rather than do the whole conversation, after all; how do you want to play it?)</font><br>

[Fri Sep 29 20:48:35 2006] : <B>(1) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>All right. What you learn from the lesser nobles, and the duke's infrequent commentary, is that the commercial revolution in Sune dates back a little bit before Shadow-watcher took over.</font><br>
[Fri Sep 29 20:49:02 2006] : <B>(1) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>Between the Dragon War and Shadow-watcher, the kingdom was a lot like a Patchwork Kingdom&#8212;fought over as a prize, but never fully ruled by any dragon.</font><br>
[Fri Sep 29 20:49:18 2006] : <B>(1) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>The land simply wasn't prosperous, the people not obsequious enough, to satisfy dragon instincts.</font><br>
[Fri Sep 29 20:49:58 2006] : <B>(1) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>And the current royal house Takemura, and the previous three dynasties, did an amazing job of setting dragons against one another to retain their own independence.</font><br>
[Fri Sep 29 20:50:48 2006] : <B>(1) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>However, a few decades before Shadow-watcher arrived, the king lost the traditional power of divine edict, not to mortal conspirators or dragon rulership, but to the angels themselves.</font><br>
[Fri Sep 29 20:51:30 2006] : <B>(1) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>The king of the time clashed with the Church&#8212;the details aren't mentioned in depth by the lords&#8212;and the Church flatly declared that the king did not have the power to issue edicts with the strength of divine law.</font><br>
[Fri Sep 29 20:52:18 2006] : <B>(1) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>This created a serious problem, because the entire legal and political system was based on the edicts of the kings, and the extensive glosses (think midrashim) published by the house of the court librarians.</font><br>
[Fri Sep 29 20:52:38 2006] : <B>(1) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>Suddenly, by angelic decree, the king could not make laws, only enforce those which exist.</font><br>
[Fri Sep 29 20:53:15 2006] : <B>(1) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>Enter Shadow-watcher, one of the most subtle opportunists known to dragon lore. (The Baron of the Falls uses this exact phrase, with a hint of adulation.)</font><br>
[Fri Sep 29 20:54:09 2006] : <B>(1) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>He doesn't conquer the city; he reveals himself as the long-hidden head of an ancient secret society called The Silver Tree.</font><br>
[Fri Sep 29 20:54:29 2006] : <B>(3) Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>( o_O )</font><br>
[Fri Sep 29 20:55:11 2006] : <B>(1) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>The count can't quite express this in the trade tongue; he has to resort to a hobgoblin expression: "arose in fullness as," which could mean a revelation, or could mean an assumption.</font><br>
[Fri Sep 29 20:55:27 2006] : <B>(1) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>Odds are good that Shadow-watcher usurped an existing position.</font><br>
[Fri Sep 29 20:55:51 2006] : <B>(1) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>Either way, he was able to take de facto control of the economy and commerce through his disciples of The Silver Tree...</font><br>
[Fri Sep 29 20:56:15 2006] : <B>(1) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>...and here, Count Ano declares with glee, is the genius of it. The vast majority of the nobility are hobgoblins.</font><br>
[Fri Sep 29 20:56:27 2006] : <B>(1) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>The vast majority of the Silver Tree, and of businessmen and traders in general, are goblins.</font><br>
[Fri Sep 29 20:56:40 2006] : <B>(3) Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>(Divide and fucking conquer. Sigh.)</font><br>
[Fri Sep 29 20:57:09 2006] : <B>(1) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>Shadow-watcher gained the ability to control the terms of business&#8212;and by controlling what sorts of contracts and agreements businesses make, he made himself the legislator of Sune.</font><br>
[Fri Sep 29 20:57:18 2006] : <B>(1) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>Filling the power void the Church created when they neutered the king.</font><br>
[Fri Sep 29 20:57:45 2006] : <B>(1) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>So Shadow-watcher has absolutely zero official power; and near-absolute real power.</font><br>
[Fri Sep 29 20:58:19 2006] : <B>(1) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>The only thing he doesn't control is the military; and King Sesshu IV hasn't been eager to try to take the reins away from Genjiro.</font><br>
[Fri Sep 29 20:58:32 2006] : <B>(1) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>This is the only reason Genjiro Patchwork Kingdom rampage has been allowed to continue.</font><br>
[Fri Sep 29 20:59:03 2006] : <B>(1) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>And (this part Kensuke interjects) <i>nobody</i> has any clue which side Genjiro supports.</font><br>

[Fri Sep 29 21:02:48 2006] : <B>(4) Rien</B>: <font color='#004000'>Rien wil ask where Sakade and Kifura come into all this, and if they don't know (or pretend not ot know) about them, he'll plead a momentary brain-fart, or something like that.</font><br>

[Fri Sep 29 21:21:33 2006] : <B>(1) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>A nagging sensation had been tickling at the back of Rien's skull for a little while now; and now he identifies it.</font><br>
[Fri Sep 29 21:21:58 2006] : <B>(1) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>The planar fabric is weakening; the effect is exactly the same as when Rien plays Ander's drum.</font><br>

[Fri Sep 29 21:25:39 2006] : <B>(1) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>The focal point is closest to Kensuke Toshiro, though not directly under him. In fact, Rien realizes, it would have been directly under Kensuke if the chairs hadn't been moved upon Rien's arrival.</font><br>
[Fri Sep 29 21:26:57 2006] : <B>(4) Rien</B>: <font color='#004000'>"My Lords, I feel I must warn you that there is a severe weakening of the planar fabric in this area.  I would suggest that we all leave this booth immediately."</font><br>

[Fri Sep 29 21:29:55 2006] : <B>(1) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>"Up, out," he barks in hobgoblin. "Quick."</font><br>
[Fri Sep 29 21:30:05 2006] : <B>(1) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>But at about this moment, Rien feels an incoming Slice.</font><br>
[Fri Sep 29 21:30:42 2006] : <B>(1) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>Now, having identified the danger, Rien does have the ability to counter it, but only by "using up" the planar weakening with his own Slice...</font><br>

[Fri Sep 29 21:34:04 2006] : <B>(1) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>A rent appears in the air behind Rien's sword, and a bright white light beams out from it; daytime in a much balmier climate. Mist forms in the air as humid heat pours from the portal.</font><br>
[Fri Sep 29 21:34:37 2006] : <B>(1) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>Then, with a sudden and terrible force, air rushes into the portal, creating a hurricane-like vacuum.</font><br>
[Fri Sep 29 21:35:03 2006] : <B>(1) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>It seems the invading force planned to simply suck the entire contents of the VIP box into the planar rift.</font><br>
[Fri Sep 29 21:35:50 2006] : <B>(1) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>Rien may not be able to counteract the wind; his experience so far has been in creating wind by moving air around, not in stopping air from moving.</font><br>

[Fri Sep 29 21:36:15 2006] : <B>(1) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>Redirecting it is a good strategy; just like focusing a wind-blast from his sword.</font><br>
[Fri Sep 29 21:37:07 2006] : <B>(1) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>The guards rush in and pull the nobles to safety; the servants and wives are on the safe side of the portal, so they don't experience the suction effect as much to begin with.</font><br>

[Fri Sep 29 21:38:59 2006] : <B>(1) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>Rien's efforts reduce the intensity of the vortex; and after ten seconds, the wind dies down. The mouth of the rift had been opaque with hurricane-channeled mist and dust and even snow from the Sune side, but as the wind attack exhausts its fury, Rien gets the barest glimpse before the portal ripples shut.</font><br>
[Fri Sep 29 21:39:03 2006] : <B>(3) Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>Below them, Renate feels the nobles' box tremble; she leaps up and a touch outward, reaching for whatever edge or foothold she can find.</font><br>

[Fri Sep 29 21:47:44 2006] : <B>(1) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>The human guard says, "Miss, please sheathe that sword." His tone is bouncer-polite, not polite-polite.</font><br>
