[Fri Jan 15 19:27:45 2010] : <b>(2242) Alan</b>: <font color='#000080'>Rien does not have all the parts he needs to reconfigure the device, at first; but acting on memories beyond his conscious mind, he darts across the room to open storage bins and assemble odd lengths of pipe, tiny mirrors, and snap together glass bulbs filled with gears and springs.</font><br />
[Fri Jan 15 19:28:34 2010] : <b>(2242) Alan</b>: <font color='#000080'>He can only guess at the magic involved, but the more he sees of the probable flows of energy through the devices, the more he is able to tie its workings in to his existing knowledge.</font><br />
[Fri Jan 15 19:29:00 2010] : <b>(2240) Aryk</b>: <font color='#710000'>"Kind of weird.  It seems like Rien's really started to remember things," Aryk remarks to Renate, watching Rien work.</font><br />
[Fri Jan 15 19:29:15 2010] : <b>(2242) Alan</b>: <font color='#000080'>He begins to suspect that, if he were given a team of master elven artificers and told to design such a device, he might come up with something similar.</font><br />
[Fri Jan 15 19:29:31 2010] : <b>(2241) Renate</b>: <font color='#000080'>"So it seems." Renate doesn't seem precisely happy at the prospect.</font><br />
[Fri Jan 15 19:29:51 2010] : <b>(2242) Alan</b>: <font color='#000080'>Elven artificers are in woefully short supply at the moment, though; Rien is forced to work alone.</font><br />

[Fri Jan 15 19:30:17 2010] : <b>(2240) Aryk</b>: <font color='#710000'>"What are we going to do with this thing?  Re-configuratize it so we can point it at the sky and shoot Boiling Sky into another dimension?"</font><br />
[Fri Jan 15 19:30:24 2010] : <b>(2242) Alan</b>: <font color='#000080'>He presses Aryk into a few feats of heavy lifting here and there; some of the parts are far lighter than they seem they should be, while others are heavy as lead bricks.</font><br />
[Fri Jan 15 19:30:46 2010] : <font color='#008000'>** (2240) Aryk <font color='#008000'>helps however he can, careful not to touch fragile-looking things.</font> **</font><br />
[Fri Jan 15 19:31:02 2010] : <b>(2238) Rien</b>: <font color='#400040'>Rien explains what he needs to Renate, working with parts eerily familiar whilst being completely in the dark as to what they do.</font><br />
[Fri Jan 15 19:31:36 2010] : <b>(2242) Alan</b>: <font color='#000080'>Every now and then, Rien has to puzzle over the parts and choose between three or four possible assemblies; he can only hope that what he chooses is right</font><br />
[Fri Jan 15 19:32:18 2010] : <b>(2241) Renate</b>: <font color='#000080'>"I suppose the only way to test this is to use it for real?"</font><br />
[Fri Jan 15 19:33:04 2010] : <b>(2242) Alan</b>: <font color='#000080'>The entire process takes another hour, much of it taken up in the painstaking sorting of gears and threaded screws, and the careful cleaning of a box of wires that had suffered from corrosion due to a faulty seal on their box.</font><br />
[Fri Jan 15 19:33:25 2010] : <b>(2240) Aryk</b>: <font color='#710000'>(how long do we have with the amulets?)</font><br />
[Fri Jan 15 19:33:51 2010] : <b>(2241) Renate</b>: <font color='#000080'>Accustomed to the painstaking cleaning of Crescent Light, Renate has no trouble cleaning wires.</font><br />
[Fri Jan 15 19:34:11 2010] : <b>(2242) Alan</b>: <font color='#000080'>To Rien's detail-oriented eye, your amulet fields have now definitely shrunk by a few centimeters; which means you have several more hours before the bottom of aura even reaches the soles of your choes.</font><br />
[Fri Jan 15 19:34:37 2010] : <b>(2242) Alan</b>: <font color='#000080'>The saints willing, you will not have need of the air bubbles again.</font><br />

[Fri Jan 15 19:35:18 2010] : <b>(2242) Alan</b>: <font color='#000080'>Of course, one of Aryk's first military lessons under Orden Talliger was, "they aren't, always."</font><br />
[Fri Jan 15 19:35:18 2010] : <b>(2238) Rien</b>: <font color='#400040'>(I was trying to avoid saying that)</font><br />
[Fri Jan 15 19:35:56 2010] : <b>(2242) Alan</b>: <font color='#000080'>"So pray to the saints, but don't break formation to do it."</font><br />
[Fri Jan 15 19:37:04 2010] : <b>(2242) Alan</b>: <font color='#000080'>At last, the reconfiguration is complete; or at least, Rien cannot think what he should do next. The machine looks right to him; or at least, he does not feel like he needs to do anything else.</font><br />
[Fri Jan 15 19:37:33 2010] : <b>(2242) Alan</b>: <font color='#000080'>One of the changes he made was to remove the connection between the tower-top telescope and the binocular-like viewfinder on the portal device.</font><br />
[Fri Jan 15 19:38:14 2010] : <b>(2242) Alan</b>: <font color='#000080'>Instead, the viewfinder is attached by a dozen thin wires to a smooth obsidian box whose only feature is a dozen tiny brass screw-heads to wrap the wires around.</font><br />
[Fri Jan 15 19:38:22 2010] : <b>(2242) Alan</b>: <font color='#000080'>A literal "black box."</font><br />
[Fri Jan 15 19:38:55 2010] : <b>(2242) Alan</b>: <font color='#000080'>Little metal wheels, with little winch handles, are attached to a brass fixture which has -- Rien suspects -- a magical connection to the black box.</font><br />
[Fri Jan 15 19:39:05 2010] : <b>(2238) Rien</b>: <font color='#400040'>"If I recall the histories I read correctly, then this was made to lock on to a specific... something and send people there, or retrieve them from that location."</font><br />
[Fri Jan 15 19:39:07 2010] : <b>(2242) Alan</b>: <font color='#000080'>This is very likely used to target the portal destination.</font><br />
[Fri Jan 15 19:39:38 2010] : <b>(2242) Alan</b>: <font color='#000080'>The portal, according to the histories, can only target certain extremely strong power sources -- such as the central power source of the sky fortress.</font><br />
[Fri Jan 15 19:40:12 2010] : <b>(2241) Renate</b>: <font color='#000080'>"Would it make any difference to us to find out where, my dear?"</font><br />
[Fri Jan 15 19:40:17 2010] : <b>(2242) Alan</b>: <font color='#000080'>I don't know if you all are mentally thinking of it as a "sky fortress" or as "Orbital Strongpoint A-16," a phrase you heard once right before it blew up Yves's platform thing.</font><br />

[Fri Jan 15 21:48:37 2010] : <b>(2242) Alan</b>: <font color='#000080'>It's almost completely irrelevant to the game at hand though.</font><br />

[Fri Jan 15 21:53:16 2010] : <b>(2242) Alan</b>: <font color='#000080'>"Positive! Eject outward, maximum thrust!" The captain vaults down one tier, then another, pulling an identical key out of a pocket and fumbling it into a keyhole on the opposite side of the bridge.</font><br />

[Fri Jan 15 21:54:12 2010] : <b>(2242) Alan</b>: <font color='#000080'>The captain and his second twist their keys at the same time. The entire bridge hums for a second, then a huge hollow <i>clunk</i> makes everything shake.</font><br />

[Fri Jan 15 21:56:50 2010] : <b>(2242) Alan</b>: <font color='#000080'>The armored warriors are scrambling around you, reforming. Lt. Orlean yells, "Return their weapons, then let's go! You want to help, come help!"</font><br />

[Fri Jan 15 22:00:02 2010] : <b>(2240) Aryk</b>: <font color='#710000'>Aryk grips the sword tightly, and it begins to smoke with inky blackness.  He looks to Rien and Renate, deadly serious.  "Let's bust out the heavy arms, then."</font><br />
[Fri Jan 15 22:00:20 2010] : <b>(2238) Rien</b>: <font color='#400040'>"Unimaginable magic?  Sounds like cup of tea."</font><br />

[Fri Jan 15 22:01:07 2010] : <b>(2238) Rien</b>: <font color='#400040'>Rien waits until the tube is green, then directs Renate into one.</font><br />

[Fri Jan 15 22:02:03 2010] : <b>(2238) Rien</b>: <font color='#400040'>Then let us away.</font><br />
[Fri Jan 15 22:02:44 2010] : <b>(2242) Alan</b>: <font color='#000080'>As you jump into the tube, you grow light, and fall like a feather; someone should make a spell that does that.</font><br />
[Fri Jan 15 22:03:01 2010] : <b>(2240) Aryk</b>: <font color='#710000'>And put it on a ring or something.</font><br />
[Fri Jan 15 22:03:52 2010] : <b>(2242) Alan</b>: <font color='#000080'>The magic or technology of the tube holds you on a straight drop, though. As your feet touch the ground, you hear a crashing noise from up above, and a swift fierce howling of wind; then a metallic clanging noise, then nothing.</font><br />
[Fri Jan 15 22:04:33 2010] : <b>(2240) Aryk</b>: <font color='#710000'>(Damn)</font><br />
[Fri Jan 15 22:04:43 2010] : <b>(2242) Alan</b>: <font color='#000080'>A second later, a klaxon begins to sound, repetitive and piercing. "Hull breach!" one of the warriors yells. "Ignore it! Face the objective! We're in for worse if we don't take out this dragon!"</font><br />
