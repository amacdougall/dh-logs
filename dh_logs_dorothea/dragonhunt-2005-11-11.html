[Fri Nov 11 19:07:36 2005] : <B>(2) Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>Well, I believe the first scene is Aryk talking things over with Ricard, so Rennie will just leave him to it while she takes Dorothy for a walk and scares up some dinner for everybody.</font><br>
[Fri Nov 11 19:08:08 2005] : <B>(1) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>Oh, Matt, in response to your latest email -- you don't need to learn any Flash, or rather, to help me you'd have to learn some pretty intensive programming aspects of Flash.</font><br>
[Fri Nov 11 19:08:24 2005] : <B>(1) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>If that's up your alley, fine; but really all you'd have to do is art.</font><br>
[Fri Nov 11 19:08:58 2005] : <B>(1) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>As for atmosphere, heck, wait until I get a working engine before putting too much thought in! It'll be set in the Dragonhunt world, though.</font><br>
[Fri Nov 11 19:09:26 2005] : <B>(1) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>Anyway, over to the game.</font><br>
[Fri Nov 11 19:09:59 2005] : <B>(3) Aryk</B>: <font color='#000080'>Will do, then.</font><br>
[Fri Nov 11 19:10:37 2005] : <B>(1) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>Just give me two or three seconds of some Dragonhunt-type guy doing some sort of attack -- really just so I can test whatever animation routine I write.</font><br>
[Fri Nov 11 19:10:52 2005] : <B>(1) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>A spinning beachball would be as effective, but not as nifty.</font><br>
[Fri Nov 11 19:11:07 2005] : <B>(3) Aryk</B>: <font color='#000080'>Something really basic then?</font><br>
[Fri Nov 11 19:11:45 2005] : <B>(1) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>Well, you've played games like Shining Force and Fire Emblem, right? Overheard icon tile-based things, cut to a very simple little "guy takes a swing" cinematic for each fight.</font><br>
[Fri Nov 11 19:11:50 2005] : <B>(1) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>I'm thinking of *exactly* that.</font><br>
[Fri Nov 11 19:12:33 2005] : <B>(3) Aryk</B>: <font color='#000080'>'Cuz you know if it's in a DH setting, Rien and Aryk and Renate are going to HAVE to be involved.</font><br>
[Fri Nov 11 19:13:08 2005] : <B>(1) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>I'm kind of thinking it would be all new characters, but possibly in the same time period. Let's not talk about plot right now, though. Actually I want to avoid getting anyone too excited.</font><br>
[Fri Nov 11 19:13:16 2005] : <B>(3) Aryk</B>: <font color='#000080'>Never played Fire Emblem, but I think I know what you have in mind.  Again, I have a cousin who could really help us out in this route.  He's got one year left before he gets his degree in video game design, and he's the top of his class.</font><br>
[Fri Nov 11 19:13:29 2005] : <B>(3) Aryk</B>: <font color='#000080'>Sure, sure.</font><br>
[Fri Nov 11 19:13:46 2005] : <B>(1) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>I don't want to have to learn C for it.</font><br>
[Fri Nov 11 19:14:56 2005] : <B>(3) Aryk</B>: <font color='#000080'>Besides all that, he's just a super-talented guy.  I know if the three of us got together, shit would hit the fan.</font><br>
[Fri Nov 11 19:15:13 2005] : <B>(1) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>Anyway, let's just play some Dragonhunt right now. We can talk about the other stuff later.</font><br>
[Fri Nov 11 19:15:23 2005] : <B>(3) Aryk</B>: <font color='#000080'>right.</font><br>
[Fri Nov 11 19:16:34 2005] : <B>(1) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>Okay, turning the log on.</font><br>
[Fri Nov 11 19:17:32 2005] : <B>(1) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>Grayport Commerce Road is busy; freight-wagons trundle along from Grayport warehouses toward the bridge over the Falcoon.</font><br>
[Fri Nov 11 19:18:07 2005] : <B>(1) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>The southermost border of the Clover District has enough of a police and Lawbringer presence that people and cargo along the road are safe enough; just don't go after dark.</font><br>
[Fri Nov 11 19:19:24 2005] : <B>(1) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>Ricard manifests out of Aryk's black mood, holy armor dripping blood. He glances down at his unusual raiment. "You know we have to do our own laundry, right?"</font><br>
[Fri Nov 11 19:20:01 2005] : <B>(2) Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>A respectful distance behind them, Renate suppresses a chuckle.</font><br>

[Fri Nov 11 19:22:08 2005] : <B>(1) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>"I reflect your mental state, Aryk. Which is why I'm usually as mellow as the wind-blown clouds," he adds with faint irony.</font><br>
[Fri Nov 11 19:23:43 2005] : <B>(3) Aryk</B>: <font color='#000080'>"Oh, right," Aryk agrees.  He looks around to make sure he's not within earshot of anyone, and ducks off to the side of the road.  "Ricard... my eternal companion... listen... I KNOW that you're supposed to reflect everything that I am.  I KNOW it."</font><br>
[Fri Nov 11 19:24:45 2005] : <B>(3) Aryk</B>: <font color='#000080'>"But all that crap aside... I have to know... first of all... how would YOU feel... if I turned a cold shoulder to the fact Emily is a Kahanite?  I mean to say... is there some scripture that, like, forbids me to consort with her?"</font><br>
[Fri Nov 11 19:25:23 2005] : <B>(3) Aryk</B>: <font color='#000080'>"Does the<b> law</b> say that I have to, you know, smite her, because of what she is?"</font><br>
[Fri Nov 11 19:25:47 2005] : <B>(1) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>"No. There is only a tradition. And as the Kahanites delight in pointing out, the tradition is largely on our side."</font><br>
[Fri Nov 11 19:26:24 2005] : <B>(1) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>"The fact is that Kahanites seem to do good as often as evil. It is their capriciousness that damns them, for one act of good does not balance out one act of evil."</font><br>

[Fri Nov 11 19:28:57 2005] : <B>(3) Aryk</B>: <font color='#000080'>Aryk deliberates a bit before nodding.  "Okay.  I understand, I think.  I don't know what I'm going to do about Emily.  I really don't.  I love her, though, you know that.  And I have to think that there is some reason, at the root of it all, that she is what she is.  As long as you don't abandon me for not shutting her out of my life, I think I can deal with all of this. "</font><br>
[Fri Nov 11 19:29:45 2005] : <B>(1) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>"I am not sure she is a Kahanite in the sense you mean it, Aryk."</font><br>

[Fri Nov 11 19:30:08 2005] : <B>(3) Aryk</B>: <font color='#000080'>Aryk pauses.  "What other sense is there?"</font><br>
[Fri Nov 11 19:30:45 2005] : <B>(3) Aryk</B>: <font color='#000080'>"I mean, either you worship a demon, or you don't, right?"</font><br>

[Fri Nov 11 19:32:41 2005] : <B>(3) Aryk</B>: <font color='#000080'>"Is THAT what this is about?  You mean to say that Emily never actually said, 'Hey Kahan, I want to worship you,'... it's just that, like, her actions led her TO Kahan?!"</font><br>
[Fri Nov 11 19:33:09 2005] : <B>(1) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>"It is possible, Aryk," he says. "Imagine the life someone might lead, if her life's goal was the pursuit of Garland Stahl."</font><br>

[Fri Nov 11 19:36:30 2005] : <B>(1) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>"Garland Stahl. He was eating a deep-friend candy bar. It seems Kahan still orders him to risk his life."</font><br>
