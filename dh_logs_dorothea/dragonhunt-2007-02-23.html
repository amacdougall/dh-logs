[Fri Feb 23 19:14:13 2007] : <B>(4) Aryk.</B>: <font color='#a40000'>I thought that was the point.  So what DID happen last session?</font><br>

[Fri Feb 23 19:15:19 2007] : <B>(1) Alan</B>: <font color='#000000'>Changing player actions after they've occurred is rude, and this particular case fucks Renate up good. So removing it is the best solution.</font><br>

[Fri Feb 23 19:17:41 2007] : <B>(2) Rien</B>: <font color='#004000'>The "messing aorund with heads" thing would have gotten Rien righteously angry.  If Verentine has been subverted, enslaved, and plated, Rien'll still be righteously angry, because he's got this whole *thing* about slavery.</font><br>
[Fri Feb 23 19:18:34 2007] : <B>(3) Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>basically... and Renate's quite fond of Takemura, so trust me, she's still got a hate on for S-W.</font><br>
[Fri Feb 23 19:19:09 2007] : <B>(1) Alan</B>: <font color='#000000'>Well, things should wrap up fairly well.</font><br>
[Fri Feb 23 19:19:20 2007] : <B>(1) Alan</B>: <font color='#000000'>For once, there'll be a relatively happy ending. Barring disaster.</font><br>

[Fri Feb 23 19:20:57 2007] : <B>(1) Alan</B>: <font color='#000000'>I'll set the scene. Then run and stir coffee. We'll assume you've convened with the king in private?</font><br>
[Fri Feb 23 19:21:08 2007] : <B>(1) Alan</B>: <font color='#000000'>Since everyone should be back at the fortress at this point.</font><br>
[Fri Feb 23 19:21:22 2007] : <B>(3) Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>Sure.</font><br>
[Fri Feb 23 19:21:32 2007] : <B>(3) Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>I hope he can come across with some buffs.</font><br>
