[Fri Aug 19 18:58:59 2005] : <B>(1) Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>well, actually, they went back to Gereval so that Renate could address the College, so it's an even LONGER train ride. :)</font><br>

[Fri Aug 19 19:00:46 2005] : <B>(1) Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>well, time to foment the Great Cat-Girl Revolution</font><br>
[Fri Aug 19 19:01:39 2005] : <B>(2) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>Well, you'll be competing against Justin's ideas there. He's got them as a tribe of tough-talking warrior women who just happen to have picked prostitution as a more compassionate alternative to brigandry.</font><br>
[Fri Aug 19 19:02:09 2005] : <B>(2) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>I was just going to leave them in the background.</font><br>

[Fri Aug 19 19:02:32 2005] : <B>(1) Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>I like that, actually.</font><br>
[Fri Aug 19 19:03:17 2005] : <B>(1) Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>Reminds me of the sisters from a campaign I used to be in -- they used prostitution to finance all kinds of war and espionage.</font><br>
[Fri Aug 19 19:03:30 2005] : <B>(1) Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>Well, hell, if they're gonna be like that I'm damn well gonna recruit 'em.</font><br>
[Fri Aug 19 19:03:38 2005] : <B>(2) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>Sure, we've got some of the 60s sci-fi/unempathetic-geek thing where women are implicitly sexualized, but also the 60s sci-fi/freethinker thing where sex can make people happy.</font><br>
[Fri Aug 19 19:03:40 2005] : <B>(1) Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>Because, why not?</font><br>
[Fri Aug 19 19:04:50 2005] : <B>(1) Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>Well, it's a different approach to the power dynamics of it. If you're a war-whore, you don't have a pimp because you can damn well protect yourself, and you only go with the johns YOU decide are okay.</font><br>
[Fri Aug 19 19:05:02 2005] : <B>(1) Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>And you probably feel a pretty substantial contempt for 'em, too.</font><br>
[Fri Aug 19 19:05:03 2005] : <B>(2) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>Right, that's where the catgirls are coming from.</font><br>
[Fri Aug 19 19:05:23 2005] : <B>(1) Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>Which, given the guys I've known who patronize prostitutes, is probably warranted.</font><br>
[Fri Aug 19 19:05:52 2005] : <B>(2) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>Not sure about the contempt; the idea isn't that they're selling themselves to pursue some greater agenda of destruction. Dark Eternal would have just kicked them back out if that were the case.</font><br>
[Fri Aug 19 19:06:08 2005] : <B>(1) Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>Well, sure. It's Renate who gets to give 'em the greater agenda of destruction. *grin*</font><br>
[Fri Aug 19 19:06:17 2005] : <B>(1) Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>*evil booming laugh*</font><br>
[Fri Aug 19 19:06:27 2005] : <B>(2) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>I'm pretty sure that even in some idealized version of the worker-john relationship, neither side is consistently enchanted with the other, though.</font><br>
[Fri Aug 19 19:06:37 2005] : <B>(1) Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>Well, of course not.</font><br>
[Fri Aug 19 19:06:53 2005] : <B>(2) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>The best you hope for is a consistent mutual respect.</font><br>

[Fri Aug 19 19:07:17 2005] : <B>(1) Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>Well, as with any job, you have your good clients and your suck ones. So to speak.</font><br>
[Fri Aug 19 19:07:37 2005] : <B>(1) Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>I am a little surprised they don't have a male contingent, though.</font><br>
[Fri Aug 19 19:07:50 2005] : <B>(1) Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>Maybe they do. Be another angle on the homosexual-as-sissyboy thing.</font><br>

[Fri Aug 19 19:08:35 2005] : <B>(2) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>Well, Parnesse was never an adventuring location in the original.</font><br>
[Fri Aug 19 19:08:52 2005] : <B>(1) Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>Just background detail?</font><br>
[Fri Aug 19 19:09:03 2005] : <B>(2) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>Okay, they did go there at the very end, but things were ... chaotic.</font><br>
