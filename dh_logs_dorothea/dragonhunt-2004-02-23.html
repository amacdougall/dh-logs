[Mon Feb 23 18:21:53 2004] : <B>(2) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>I'm flattered, though.</font><br>
[Mon Feb 23 18:22:06 2004] : <B>(2) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>I just don't think you'd be able to maintain me in the lifestyle to which I've become accustomed.</font><br>

[Mon Feb 23 18:22:28 2004] : <B>(2) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>So anyway, what's your question?</font><br>
[Mon Feb 23 18:22:29 2004] : <B>(3) Aryk</B>: <font color='#000080'>Come on, Alan, I'm a real catch.  No really... did you steal the names Bevier and Alhambra from the Beach Park area?</font><br>
[Mon Feb 23 18:22:45 2004] : <B>(2) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>The Alhambra is a famous mosque in Spain.</font><br>
[Mon Feb 23 18:22:55 2004] : <B>(2) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>And Bevier is indeed from Bevier Park, in Beach Park.</font><br>
[Mon Feb 23 18:23:04 2004] : <B>(2) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>The mosque in Zion is "Al-Huda."</font><br>

[Mon Feb 23 18:23:20 2004] : <B>(2) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>The marriage thing, or the Alhambra thing?</font><br>
[Mon Feb 23 18:23:25 2004] : <B>(1) Jenny</B>: <font color='#000080'>the former</font><br>
[Mon Feb 23 18:23:29 2004] : <B>(2) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>Ah, right. :)</font><br>
[Mon Feb 23 18:23:58 2004] : <B>(3) Aryk</B>: <font color='#000080'>You know, I don't think I've ever been told this... Dorothea, where are you located?</font><br>
[Mon Feb 23 18:24:01 2004] : <B>(1) Jenny</B>: <font color='#000080'>Madison WI</font><br>
[Mon Feb 23 18:24:04 2004] : <B>(1) Jenny</B>: <font color='#000080'>90 minutes from Alan</font><br>
[Mon Feb 23 18:24:13 2004] : <B>(3) Aryk</B>: <font color='#000080'>Ah yes.  You guys met online?</font><br>
[Mon Feb 23 18:24:17 2004] : <B>(1) Jenny</B>: <font color='#000080'>yup</font><br>
[Mon Feb 23 18:25:04 2004] : <B>(3) Aryk</B>: <font color='#000080'>That's awesome.  I was just admiring our game the other day, thinking of all the different parts of the world we come together to play from, and then I was like... hey... where's Dorothea?</font><br>
[Mon Feb 23 18:25:13 2004] : <B>(1) Jenny</B>: <font color='#000080'>:)</font><br>
[Mon Feb 23 18:25:23 2004] : <B>(3) Aryk</B>: <font color='#000080'>Anyway, enough with my tangent.</font><br>
[Mon Feb 23 18:25:36 2004] : <B>(1) Jenny</B>: <font color='#000080'>I think that's a "turn on the log and let's go," Alan.</font><br>

[Mon Feb 23 18:25:53 2004] : <B>(2) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>Sorry, was talking to Dave.</font><br>
[Mon Feb 23 18:26:26 2004] : <B>(2) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>Anyway, the Ozone Dragonhunt campaign had people from Australia (Adrian), Germany, Georgia (in the US), South Korea, and Milwaukee (that's me).</font><br>
[Mon Feb 23 18:26:41 2004] : <B>(3) Aryk</B>: <font color='#000080'>Wow, that's even more impressive.</font><br>
[Mon Feb 23 18:27:15 2004] : <B>(3) Aryk</B>: <font color='#000080'>Gee, thanks for making this feel less signifigant for me.  :-)</font><br>
[Mon Feb 23 18:27:22 2004] : <B>(2) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>The game collapsed due to scheduling conflicts.</font><br>
[Mon Feb 23 18:27:29 2004] : <B>(3) Aryk</B>: <font color='#000080'>I can imagine.</font><br>
[Mon Feb 23 18:27:43 2004] : <B>(2) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>You simply can't get people on the same time frame if they're distributed so evenly across time zones.</font><br>
[Mon Feb 23 18:27:51 2004] : <B>(1) Jenny</B>: <font color='#000080'>Well, if we get through this semester okay all my weeknights open up. :)</font><br>
[Mon Feb 23 18:28:20 2004] : <B>(3) Aryk</B>: <font color='#000080'>That'll be awesome.</font><br>
[Mon Feb 23 18:29:01 2004] : <B>(2) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>Hey, I'm up for some marathoning, but Adrian's our problem now. The misguided fool seems to think that higher education is more important than role-playing games.</font><br>
[Mon Feb 23 18:29:28 2004] : <B>(1) Jenny</B>: <font color='#000080'>yes, well, remember that we had to kill Tuesdays because of my evening class :)</font><br>

[Mon Feb 23 18:32:54 2004] : <B>(2) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>Yeah, I've got it right here from Rob. I suck at it horribly. Even though I have a basic idea how people work, and I can beat the computer, newbie button-mashers wipe the floor with me.</font><br>
[Mon Feb 23 18:33:12 2004] : <B>(3) Aryk</B>: <font color='#000080'>One of Nightmare's swords in the game, I think it may have been the "Faust," is sort of how I pictured Aryk's zweihander.   </font><br>
[Mon Feb 23 18:33:25 2004] : <B>(3) Aryk</B>: <font color='#000080'>You probably won't agree with me on the size issue, though.</font><br>
[Mon Feb 23 18:33:56 2004] : <B>(2) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>Ah, yeah. You know, it's okay if you have a gigantic zweihander; I'd always seen it as more like the two-handed broadsword Michelle Yeoh uses to fight Zhang Zhi-Yi in that scene of Crouching Tiger.</font><br>
[Mon Feb 23 18:34:07 2004] : <B>(1) Jenny</B>: <font color='#000080'>what, is the thing colossally humongous, or merely f***ing huge?</font><br>
[Mon Feb 23 18:34:09 2004] : <B>(2) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>You can't argue that Nightmare's sword is balanced for defense.</font><br>
[Mon Feb 23 18:34:15 2004] : <B>(2) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>I'll find a screenshot.</font><br>

[Mon Feb 23 18:34:45 2004] : <B>(1) Jenny</B>: <font color='#000080'>ah, gotcha</font><br>
[Mon Feb 23 18:35:00 2004] : <B>(1) Jenny</B>: <font color='#000080'>(at some point I'm going to have to use that line IC, I think)</font><br>
[Mon Feb 23 18:35:11 2004] : <B>(1) Jenny</B>: <font color='#000080'>(except that Jenny doesn't swear)</font><br>
[Mon Feb 23 18:35:16 2004] : <B>(3) Aryk</B>: <font color='#000080'>I just can't help thinking about it without "Buster Sword" coming to mind.</font><br>

[Mon Feb 23 18:35:45 2004] : <B>(2) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>I clicked it from Google's image search and it gave me a "you're a leecher" violation which is now cached.</font><br>

[Mon Feb 23 18:36:12 2004] : <B>(1) Jenny</B>: <font color='#000080'>that IS f***ing colossally huge</font><br>
[Mon Feb 23 18:36:34 2004] : <B>(2) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>At least his fighting style is all about swinging it, and taking up a new stance by leaving the sword where it was.</font><br>
[Mon Feb 23 18:36:50 2004] : <B>(2) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>Like he swings upwards, then it just hangs down his back because he can't muscle it back into place.</font><br>
[Mon Feb 23 18:36:59 2004] : <B>(1) Jenny</B>: <font color='#000080'>whereas Jenny's is substantially "I am not where you think I am."</font><br>
[Mon Feb 23 18:36:59 2004] : <B>(2) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>So his next move is something that involves unslinging it from his back.</font><br>
[Mon Feb 23 18:37:16 2004] : <B>(2) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>Yeah, check the map. It's like that. :)</font><br>
[Mon Feb 23 18:37:26 2004] : <B>(1) Jenny</B>: <font color='#000080'>LOL</font><br>
[Mon Feb 23 18:37:27 2004] : <B>(3) Aryk</B>: <font color='#000080'>I don't picture it as big as Nightmare's main sword, it's one of his extra ones you earn.</font><br>
[Mon Feb 23 18:37:40 2004] : <B>(3) Aryk</B>: <font color='#000080'>Heh heh</font><br>
[Mon Feb 23 18:37:51 2004] : <B>(2) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>Anyway, if Aryk's sword were that size, he wouldn't be able to wield it with a strength of 15.</font><br>
[Mon Feb 23 18:37:58 2004] : <B>(2) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>It's immaterial at the moment, anyway.</font><br>

[Mon Feb 23 20:59:13 2004] : <B>(1) Jenny</B>: <font color='#000080'>you are a fine man to play the straight man to. :)</font><br>

[Mon Feb 23 20:59:59 2004] : <B>(3) Aryk</B>: <font color='#000080'>Mostly because I only have a faint idea of how points work.</font><br>
[Mon Feb 23 21:00:07 2004] : <B>(1) Jenny</B>: <font color='#000080'>oh, points are wonderful things. :)</font><br>
[Mon Feb 23 21:00:07 2004] : <B>(2) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>You'll probably get ten points each, plus specific points for specific stuff.</font><br>
[Mon Feb 23 21:00:14 2004] : <B>(3) Aryk</B>: <font color='#000080'>Wow.</font><br>
[Mon Feb 23 21:00:43 2004] : <B>(3) Aryk</B>: <font color='#000080'>Somehow, we managed to get a decent amount accomplished while not doing much at all.</font><br>
[Mon Feb 23 21:00:51 2004] : <B>(1) Jenny</B>: <font color='#000080'>yeah, we did all right.</font><br>
[Mon Feb 23 21:01:02 2004] : <B>(1) Jenny</B>: <font color='#000080'>mostly confirming existing guesses, but nothing wrong with that.</font><br>
[Mon Feb 23 21:01:09 2004] : <B>(1) Jenny</B>: <font color='#000080'>and got some good RP in.</font><br>

[Mon Feb 23 21:01:15 2004] : <B>(2) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>10 points buys you a skillrank; 25 points raises an ability one point, up to 14; 50 points raises an ability one point, above 14; 50 points buys a feat; and 100 points buys a level.</font><br>
