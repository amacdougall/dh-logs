[Fri Jun 17 18:33:55 2005] : <B>Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>Well, let's get started now. Rien's in a coma for a while.</font><br>
[Fri Jun 17 18:34:29 2005] : <B>Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>Right-ho.</font><br>
[Fri Jun 17 18:34:32 2005] : <B>Aryk</B>: <font color='#000080'>Okay.</font><br>
[Fri Jun 17 18:35:37 2005] : <B>Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>So what's on your agenda? I have a few things that need to be said or done, but I'm pretty sure they'll fall naturally into the epilogue stuff you're thinking of.</font><br>
[Fri Jun 17 18:36:16 2005] : <B>Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>Well, Renate's got all kinds of Things That Must Be Done, but she'll need somebody who can run errands for her while she's sitting with Rien and Coris hasn't got there yet.</font><br>
[Fri Jun 17 18:36:37 2005] : <B>Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>She'll want to talk to Talos, telegraph her parents, send a messenger to Cobalt Aerie, that kind of thing.</font><br>
[Fri Jun 17 18:37:36 2005] : <B>Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>Have a statement notarized that Coris had nothing whatsoever to do with the mess in the quarry. Just in case.</font><br>
[Fri Jun 17 18:38:20 2005] : <B>Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>(because Darm is such a creep that Renate wouldn't put it past him to try to nail Coris's hide to the wall that way)</font><br>
[Fri Jun 17 18:39:17 2005] : <B>Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>Aryk, how about you?</font><br>
[Fri Jun 17 18:39:39 2005] : <B>Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>Concert in Ilium.</font><br>
[Fri Jun 17 18:39:49 2005] : <B>Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>Well, yeah, but there's a whole day before that.</font><br>
[Fri Jun 17 18:39:52 2005] : <B>Aryk</B>: <font color='#000080'>Before the show Aryk's going to mostly want to just work on material with Arretia.  He wants to ask around the crew who to talk to to put an album out.  Oh, and tending to Rien.  Before the show, there's not much he wants accomplished.</font><br>
[Fri Jun 17 18:40:07 2005] : <B>Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>He's not going to go to Eleanora and try to drum up an audience? I would.</font><br>
[Fri Jun 17 18:40:24 2005] : <B>Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>Renate will take care of Rien, don't you worry about that.</font><br>
[Fri Jun 17 18:40:51 2005] : <B>Aryk</B>: <font color='#000080'>That's a good point.  Since they are in Illium, he'll want to go around promoting the show ahead of time.</font><br>
[Fri Jun 17 18:41:09 2005] : <B>Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>It's as close as you've got to a home base.</font><br>
[Fri Jun 17 18:41:26 2005] : <B>Aryk</B>: <font color='#000080'>Going to familiar clubs, maybe hooking up with familiar peeps (like Eleanora) to spread the word.  This is the most important show, after all.</font><br>
[Fri Jun 17 18:41:53 2005] : <B>Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>Center of the art world and all that.</font><br>
[Fri Jun 17 18:42:02 2005] : <B>Aryk</B>: <font color='#000080'>Most exactly.</font><br>
[Fri Jun 17 18:42:10 2005] : <B>Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>And Talos has got a lot of the right connections. So does Nora.</font><br>
[Fri Jun 17 18:42:29 2005] : <B>Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>Heck, you could even talk to Le Duc if you don't mind the Soleil connection.</font><br>
[Fri Jun 17 18:42:37 2005] : <B>Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>If he's back in town, sure, why not?</font><br>
[Fri Jun 17 18:42:40 2005] : <B>Aryk</B>: <font color='#000080'>Speaking of which, Aryk and Sylvie still need to have that chat.  But that can still wait.</font><br>
[Fri Jun 17 18:42:52 2005] : <B>Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>At this point we are not even nominally opposed to Soleil -- just not committed.</font><br>
[Fri Jun 17 18:43:02 2005] : <B>Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>At some point, you three will have to come up with a single direction to go in after this, too.</font><br>
[Fri Jun 17 18:43:02 2005] : <B>Aryk</B>: <font color='#000080'>Yup.</font><br>
[Fri Jun 17 18:43:09 2005] : <B>Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>To decide what the next chapter is.</font><br>
[Fri Jun 17 18:43:15 2005] : <B>Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>Oh, I think we know roughly where we're going. We can discuss it later.</font><br>
[Fri Jun 17 18:43:23 2005] : <B>Aryk</B>: <font color='#000080'>Yeah.</font><br>
[Fri Jun 17 18:43:33 2005] : <B>Aryk</B>: <font color='#000080'>Me and D talked about this a bit the other night.</font><br>
[Fri Jun 17 18:43:36 2005] : <B>Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>And I still want to resolve the Mia Schala situation before the next chapter starts. :)</font><br>
[Fri Jun 17 18:43:55 2005] : <B>Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>I've talked about it with Adrian. We're all basically on the same page.</font><br>
[Fri Jun 17 18:44:04 2005] : <B>Aryk</B>: <font color='#000080'>Cool.</font><br>
[Fri Jun 17 18:44:17 2005] : <B>Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>So, Mr. GM, take it away at your leisure.</font><br>
[Fri Jun 17 18:44:41 2005] : <B>Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>(Adrian just arrived on IM.)</font><br>
[Fri Jun 17 18:44:54 2005] : <B>Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>Ah, excellent.</font><br>
[Fri Jun 17 18:45:11 2005] : <B>Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>We'll start up without him, since he's still unconscious; just get him on.</font><br>

[Fri Jun 17 18:46:07 2005] : <B>Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>Well, we've got until around 9:30ish.</font><br>
[Fri Jun 17 18:46:14 2005] : <B>Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>Should be plenty of time.</font><br>
[Fri Jun 17 18:46:36 2005] : <B>Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>Log is on.</font><br>
[Fri Jun 17 18:47:23 2005] : <B>Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>A green glass vial rests on the bedside table; a thin copper wire runs from it to a coupling linked to a needle bound to Rien's forearm.</font><br>
[Fri Jun 17 18:47:52 2005] : <B>Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>The vial's colors change with his vital signs, divined by the silver needle in his bloodstream; they've been a serene green for hours now.</font><br>
[Fri Jun 17 18:48:31 2005] : <B>Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>The Church of Raphael couldn't do anything with him; instead, they referred him to this hospice, run by alchemists of a medical Tradition, for longer-term care.</font><br>
[Fri Jun 17 18:49:04 2005] : <B>Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>"Are you saying he won't wake up?" Renate had asked.</font><br>
[Fri Jun 17 18:49:35 2005] : <B>Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>The medics say that Rien's body is in perfect health; but the unchanging green of the vial says that he is in a dreamless sleep so deep that waking may be impossible.</font><br>
[Fri Jun 17 18:49:58 2005] : <B>Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>He will wake, when he is ready; but they cannot say when that will be. ("Or if," is the unspoken implication.)</font><br>
[Fri Jun 17 18:51:13 2005] : <font color='#008000'>** Renate sits with him, holding his hand on the other side from the needle. Not even when messengers come in to speak with her -- not even when the medics themselves come in will she move. **</font><br>
[Fri Jun 17 18:51:59 2005] : <B>Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>Her first words to any entrant are invariably, "Please tell me the color of the vial on the table opposite."</font><br>
[Fri Jun 17 18:52:12 2005] : <B>Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>"It's sea green. As before," Coris says.</font><br>
[Fri Jun 17 18:52:27 2005] : <B>Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>"I've sent off the letters and telegrams you dictated."</font><br>
[Fri Jun 17 18:52:35 2005] : <B>Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>He sits, and takes Renate's other hand.</font><br>
[Fri Jun 17 18:52:48 2005] : <B>Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>"He'll return. He always has before."</font><br>
[Fri Jun 17 18:52:55 2005] : <B>Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>She lets it sit for a moment, then gently removes it.</font><br>
[Fri Jun 17 18:53:05 2005] : <B>Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>"You shouldn't be here. You have a concert to run security for."</font><br>
[Fri Jun 17 18:54:12 2005] : <B>Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>"It's running itself. Lehron, Sorel, and Gravin have things well in hand."</font><br>

[Fri Jun 17 18:56:21 2005] : <B>Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>"Hm. So Darm wasn't bluffing."</font><br>
[Fri Jun 17 18:57:12 2005] : <B>Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>"I assume the paperwork is a lie; I assume they assume so too."</font><br>
[Fri Jun 17 18:57:34 2005] : <B>Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>"I don't have the resources to know where all of Heaven is going from day to day. And if I did, I'd fear for my life, anyway."</font><br>
