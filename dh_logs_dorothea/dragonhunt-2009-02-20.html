[Fri Feb 20 20:00:47 2009] : <b>(22815) Rien</b>: <font color='#003300'>Rien bows to Noble Incarnadine, then follows Renate.</font><br />

[Fri Feb 20 20:29:57 2009] : <b>(22816) Alan</b>: <font color='#000080'>North and south of Firewood Lake are marshes, but the north ones are mostly cultivated, while to the south you get wetlands fading from moors to swamp and back.</font><br />

[Fri Feb 20 20:35:51 2009] : <b>(22816) Alan</b>: <font color='#000080'>It has been shading toward evening, and the crickets have kept up a steady chorus, along with the steady hum of insects, the occasional croak of a bullfrog, the calls of birds.

[Fri Feb 20 20:55:07 2009] : <b>(22816) Alan</b>: <font color='#000080'>...duh. A bolt of lightning snaps between heaven and earth, rippling around Rien's shield.</font><br />
[Fri Feb 20 20:55:58 2009] : <b>(22816) Alan</b>: <font color='#000080'>The lich is already extending a palm toward the ground, sending a ripping shock of earth energy along it toward Rien. His elemental powers aren't as strong at Rien's; this isn't what he's known for.</font><br />
[Fri Feb 20 20:56:36 2009] : <b>(22816) Alan</b>: <font color='#000080'>But he's chain-casting the spells faster than Rien is accustomed too; if he meets him spell for spell in this arena, he'll eventually come up short.</font><br />
[Fri Feb 20 20:57:07 2009] : <b>(22816) Alan</b>: <font color='#000080'>(he's using metamagic to accelerate his spellcasting at about 1.5 spells per round).</font><br />

[Fri Feb 20 20:58:20 2009] : <b>(22816) Alan</b>: <font color='#000080'>Fantome cancels Rien's fire blast with cold, and drifts away, paper-light, from Rien's slash.</font><br />
[Fri Feb 20 20:58:54 2009] : <b>(22816) Alan</b>: <font color='#000080'>He sends a wave of fire like an extravagant brushstroke toward Rien with a flick of his hand.</font><br />
[Fri Feb 20 20:59:47 2009] : <b>(22815) Rien</b>: <font color='#003300'>Rien teleports away from it and casts an Earth Bind</font><br />
[Fri Feb 20 21:01:21 2009] : <b>(22816) Alan</b>: <font color='#000080'>The sudden miniature chasm traps the lich's feet, but he pauses to free himself by phasing; this does require a magical effort. He interrupts the spell the instant he is free, to dart forward. Not with a push of his legs, but as if jerked by a sudden gust.</font><br />
[Fri Feb 20 21:02:08 2009] : <b>(22816) Alan</b>: <font color='#000080'>He closes the distance to just double sword range (which should be right outside Elemental Explosion range, since I originally meant Elemental Explosion to hit every adjacent hex).</font><br />
[Fri Feb 20 21:02:28 2009] : <b>(22816) Alan</b>: <font color='#000080'>(As was said in a recent session, the Explosion powers might have been mistyped but are meant to be a 1-meter radius.)</font><br />
[Fri Feb 20 21:02:54 2009] : <b>(22816) Alan</b>: <font color='#000080'>He would appear to have studied Rien's known moves, but the Earth Bind took him by surprise.</font><br />
[Fri Feb 20 21:03:31 2009] : <b>(22816) Alan</b>: <font color='#000080'>He is beginning to cast a blast of ice shards with one hand.</font><br />
[Fri Feb 20 21:03:43 2009] : <b>(22815) Rien</b>: <font color='#003300'>Rien casts the Fires of Damnation, a roiling wall of unholy flame sweeping out in a cone in front of him.</font><br />
[Fri Feb 20 21:04:19 2009] : <b>(22816) Alan</b>: <font color='#000080'>He completes the ice shards spell, focusing his power into it; he becomes slightly more solid for a moment, and his spell and Rien's cancel out again.</font><br />
[Fri Feb 20 21:04:44 2009] : <b>(22816) Alan</b>: <font color='#000080'>"You are constantly improving. I am most pleased."</font><br />
[Fri Feb 20 21:05:41 2009] : <b>(22815) Rien</b>: <font color='#003300'>Rien immediately launches an Ice Storm back at Fantome</font><br />
[Fri Feb 20 21:06:35 2009] : <b>(22816) Alan</b>: <font color='#000080'>Fantome darts in again (another sudden gust, inhuman movement), to within sword range; a wall of fire advances ahead of him, clearing out the ice storm, but losing most of its power. Fantome is becoming more solid by the second, and his magic is getting strong.</font><br />
[Fri Feb 20 21:06:55 2009] : <b>(22816) Alan</b>: <font color='#000080'>Rien feels the heat of an oven wash over him from the remnant of the fire wave.</font><br />
[Fri Feb 20 21:07:29 2009] : <b>(22816) Alan</b>: <font color='#000080'>Fantome is beginning to cast another, letting balls of fire build in his cupped hands.</font><br />
[Fri Feb 20 21:08:07 2009] : <b>(22815) Rien</b>: <font color='#003300'>Rien smiles and fades partially into the Mirror Realm, becoming a Phantom Warrior, sweeping his sword through Fantome, trying for a Life Break.</font><br />
[Fri Feb 20 21:09:40 2009] : <b>(22816) Alan</b>: <font color='#000080'>The second fire spell was a feint; the fire puffs away from his hands as he gusts forward a final time, to inside sword range. Rien's Life Break strikes only undeath, uselessly; with no life to restore, Fantome cannot have regeneration or auto-resurrection.</font><br />
[Fri Feb 20 21:10:44 2009] : <b>(22816) Alan</b>: <font color='#000080'>Rien feels his lichdom first-hand, as Fantome grabs him by the shoulder and neck, wrenching him from the Mirror Realm, as Fantome himself passes entirely into reality... his power is immense, fully revealed, and his hands are colder than ice.</font><br />
[Fri Feb 20 21:11:25 2009] : <b>(22815) Rien</b>: <font color='#003300'>Rien's power flares out, countering the cold with an explosion of fire sweeping out from his body.</font><br />
[Fri Feb 20 21:12:07 2009] : <b>(22816) Alan</b>: <font color='#000080'>His grip is like steel tongs, and his strength is the pull of the grave. He picks Rien up bodily by his neck and slams him to the ground, so hard that he nearly blacks out before instinctively exploding into fire.</font><br />
[Fri Feb 20 21:12:51 2009] : <b>(22816) Alan</b>: <font color='#000080'>Even covered in magical flames, Fantome does not let go: he tightens his grip, millimeter by millimeter, dialing it in like the thumbscrew of a C-clamp.</font><br />
[Fri Feb 20 21:13:22 2009] : <b>(22816) Alan</b>: <font color='#000080'>"Learn my secret... magic is... overrated!"</font><br />
[Fri Feb 20 21:13:48 2009] : <b>(22816) Alan</b>: <font color='#000080'>Fantome's robes have caught fire, his skin is smouldering but does not burn; it is ancient and harder than leather.</font><br />

[Fri Feb 20 21:14:18 2009] : <b>(22816) Alan</b>: <font color='#000080'>(He's just using his plain old lich strength and durability to physically choke the hell out of Rien.)</font><br />
[Fri Feb 20 21:15:02 2009] : <b>(22816) Alan</b>: <font color='#000080'>(He was moving in closer and closer, doing casual magical attacks you could easily spar and counter, lulling you so he could go for an unexpected kill.)</font><br />
[Fri Feb 20 21:15:56 2009] : <b>(22816) Alan</b>: <font color='#000080'>(And if you get out of it, he'll get serious, which will have to form the cliffhanger.)</font><br />
[Fri Feb 20 21:16:05 2009] : <b>(22815) Rien</b>: <font color='#003300'>Rien laughs and sends a shock through the earth under them, flinging them both into the air, using his body weight to twist them, pulling his legs in and coming down with both feet planted on Fantome's chest.</font><br />
[Fri Feb 20 21:16:15 2009] : <b>(22816) Alan</b>: <font color='#000080'>(Fortunately, "getting serious" actually means he starts using his secret magic that you have a defense for.)</font><br />
[Fri Feb 20 21:17:42 2009] : <b>(22816) Alan</b>: <font color='#000080'>Rien's got to have some guts to use his last breath to laugh! Fantome's grip is unbreakable during this, but Rien knocks the wind out of him and his old blank eyes bug out. He's holding on like grim death, though, and starting to cut off blood to Rien's brain as well as his breath. Rien can sense that he doesn't have long before he blacks out.</font><br />
[Fri Feb 20 21:18:08 2009] : <b>(22816) Alan</b>: <font color='#000080'>With his other hand, he's reaching for Rien's swordarm, but Rien presumably has presence of mind to avoid it.</font><br />
[Fri Feb 20 21:19:43 2009] : <b>(22815) Rien</b>: <font color='#003300'>Now that Rien's feet are in place, push up against the grip of his hands.</font><br />
[Fri Feb 20 21:22:54 2009] : <b>(22816) Alan</b>: <font color='#000080'>Rien isn't able to break his grip, but he's able to loosen it enough to get another few seconds of consciousness; Fantome twists and uses his free hand to cast a point-blank ice lance aimed at Rien's midsection.</font><br />
[Fri Feb 20 21:24:21 2009] : <b>(22815) Rien</b>: <font color='#003300'>Rien explodes with  fresh wave of fire, the white heat flaring out</font><br />
[Fri Feb 20 21:24:51 2009] : <b>(22816) Alan</b>: <font color='#000080'>This time, the fire wave wins out, canceling the ice spell and pouring over Fantome.</font><br />

[Fri Feb 20 21:25:44 2009] : <b>(22816) Alan</b>: <font color='#000080'>Either giving up, or satisfied, Fantome releases his grip on Rien's throat and drifts away on the wave of heat; with an offhanded cantrip, his purple robes are reconstituted and redraped spotlessly.</font><br />
[Fri Feb 20 21:25:47 2009] : <b>(22816) Alan</b>: <font color='#000080'>(And thank goodness!)</font><br />

[Fri Feb 20 21:35:20 2009] : <b>(22816) Alan</b>: <font color='#000080'>Well, Rien could possibly have broken his grip more decisively, but I didn't want to drag it out and it wasn't the point anyway. And it's not like it's some puzzle you were supposed to solve anyway.</font><br />
[Fri Feb 20 21:37:23 2009] : <b>(22815) Rien</b>: <font color='#003300'>Possibly.  But now he's Mr. Confidence that Rien doesn't have half the Weird Power he's attributed with.</font><br />
