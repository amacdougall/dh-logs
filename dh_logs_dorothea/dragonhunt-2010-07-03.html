[Sat Jul  3 18:22:47 2010] : <b>(1137) Alan</b>: <font color='#00008c'>Yeah. I had a car and everything! Just never went out places.</font><br />

[Sat Jul  3 18:26:02 2010] : <b>(1136) Rien</b>: <font color='#263607'>You should try going up into Walhalla here sometime, then.  Some of the roads up there are a one-way trip.  Tracks barely bigger than a walking trail, with no room to turn around at the other end (or any point between the two), so you have to reverse for a good 10 minutes to get out again.</font><br />

[Sat Jul  3 19:50:21 2010] : <b>(1137) Alan</b>: <font color='#00008c'>And Heliomere leads them in formation; Larakh runs below them, a visible aura building around him as he runs, trailing behind him like comet dust.</font><br />
[Sat Jul  3 19:50:34 2010] : <b>(1137) Alan</b>: <font color='#00008c'>They're sweeping around to attack Cardiff from the north.</font><br />
[Sat Jul  3 19:50:59 2010] : <b>(1137) Alan</b>: <font color='#00008c'>Though Renate, Aryk, and Rien have established themselves as dire threats, clearly Heliomere finds Cardiff even more threatening right now.</font><br />

[Sat Jul  3 19:53:09 2010] : <b>(1137) Alan</b>: <font color='#00008c'>Cardiff realizes he's being pincered; before Renate and Rien are even within bowshot, he casts a spell which fills the sky with a dense black cloud like octopus ink.</font><br />

[Sat Jul  3 19:57:46 2010] : <b>(1137) Alan</b>: <font color='#00008c'>Cardiff casts a spell, and a single small circle winks into existence beneath Renate's feet, so light it follows her even at her speed.

[Sat Jul  3 19:57:52 2010] : <b>(1135) Renate</b>: <font color='#000080'>"Just like you helped the Toy Soldiers, Loose-foot!" Renate yells, hoping he'll catch her drift -- and Cardiff won't.</font><br />

[Sat Jul  3 19:59:17 2010] : <b>(1137) Alan</b>: <font color='#00008c'>Heliomere's fire burns the inky smoke away, and you see the dragons soaring away, wheeling for another pass.

[Sat Jul  3 20:02:35 2010] : <b>(1137) Alan</b>: <font color='#00008c'>Granton and The Unstoppable Force fly at Cardiff, winging close to the ground, with Larakh right behind them; they're coming from about 90 degrees away from Renate and Rien. Heliomere, on the other hand, is swooping lazily down by where his army is regrouping, and Rien senses a powerful charge of arcane energy building around him.

[Sat Jul  3 20:04:53 2010] : <b>(1137) Alan</b>: <font color='#00008c'>Cardiff fires a bolt of black fire up at the two airborne dragons, knocking Granton off course and leaving a smoking patch on his shoulder. The Unstoppable Force survives to breathe ethereal white fire, which splashes off Cardiff's invisible dome.</font><br />
[Sat Jul  3 20:05:45 2010] : <b>(1137) Alan</b>: <font color='#00008c'>Larakh, traveling fast as an arrow, collides with the edge of the circle and bounces off it; the symbols of the outermose concentric circle ripple and scramble for a second before reforming.</font><br />
[Sat Jul  3 20:06:10 2010] : <b>(1137) Alan</b>: <font color='#00008c'>Cardiff appears to have no intention of removing the focus. Rien could always just try to dispel it.</font><br />

[Sat Jul  3 20:08:27 2010] : <b>(1135) Renate</b>: <font color='#000080'>No time, there is no time -- an instant after Rien's sword comes down, Renate steps resolutely inside the circle and sends her lasso toward Cardiff.</font><br />
[Sat Jul  3 20:08:43 2010] : <b>(1137) Alan</b>: <font color='#00008c'>Larakh is still recovering from his attack, and Aryk's sword strikes his smooth scales cleanly, lodging between two ribs, but not penetrating deeply.</font><br />
[Sat Jul  3 20:08:59 2010] : <b>(1137) Alan</b>: <font color='#00008c'>Rien disrupts the focus easily; there was nearly nothing to it.</font><br />

[Sat Jul  3 20:10:57 2010] : <b>(1137) Alan</b>: <font color='#00008c'>Renate feels a ripple as she passes through the outer circle; it's like stirring thick gelatin with a finger. And less than a tenth of a meter further, she's blasted with a powerful wind that nearly knocks her down -- the wind pulses, striking hard as a fist every few seconds. Invisible blades also spiral through the air within the circles; only her danger sense lets her dodge one with a seemingly effortless sway.</font><br />
[Sat Jul  3 20:11:30 2010] : <b>(1137) Alan</b>: <font color='#00008c'>To throw the lasso, she'll have to endure a wind-buffet and immediately act, but this means she can't predict the blades at the same time.</font><br />

[Sat Jul  3 21:08:46 2010] : <b>(1137) Alan</b>: <font color='#00008c'>Okay, cool.

Rien couldn't sense them all while they were running, but he can detect the energy as their magic decoheres wildly: damage resistance, regeneration, magic resistance, planar anchor, mind shield.</font><br />
[Sat Jul  3 21:16:09 2010] : <b>(1137) Alan</b>: <font color='#00008c'>The last two colors of the rainbow don't have any effect. Heliomere's magical defenses are stripped.</font><br />

[Sat Jul  3 21:17:25 2010] : <b>(1135) Renate</b>: <font color='#000080'>That gives Aryk and Rien a clear field of fire.</font><br />

[Sat Jul  3 21:18:03 2010] : <b>(1137) Alan</b>: <font color='#00008c'>Meanwhile, by the way, net-tangled Aryk landed hard and felt at least two ribs bend, and then was enveloped in twin blasts of fire. The ethereal white fire is not pure fire, and so it does more damage to him than Granton's.</font><br />
[Sat Jul  3 21:18:26 2010] : <b>(1137) Alan</b>: <font color='#00008c'>And in neither case can he use Splitfire, so he's stuck with his natural fire resistance unless he summoned Armor of Light as he fell (which I would allow).</font><br />

[Sat Jul  3 21:19:55 2010] : <b>(1137) Alan</b>: <font color='#00008c'>The golden nets aren't very strong, but they're yielding and sticky, meaning Aryk has to struggle to rip his way out.

[Sat Jul  3 21:20:40 2010] : <b>(1137) Alan</b>: <font color='#00008c'>The fire is painful, but due to his natural resistance, it makes him feel drained and sick instead of burning him. Enough of it, and he'd collapse.</font><br />
