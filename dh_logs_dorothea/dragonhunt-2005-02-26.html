[Sat Feb 26 20:09:38 2005] : <B>Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>(Heroes, too, sure, seeking adventure or mercenary action.)</font><br>
[Sat Feb 26 20:10:16 2005] : <B>Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>(But the real movers and shakers aren't going to be spending their time discussing things in an imaginary information world. They hire geeks to do that for them, then don't listen to them.)</font><br>
[Sat Feb 26 20:10:45 2005] : <B>Tancred</B>: <font color='#000080'>(LOL! But they might brag in print elsewhere. Newspapers and such. Thus the parameters on Menkhda's search.)</font><br>
[Sat Feb 26 20:11:42 2005] : <B>Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>(True. Newspaper results turn up a considerably greater proportion of rich and famous who went to Valin for one reason or another, then made a big deal about it.)</font><br>

[Sat Feb 26 20:13:22 2005] : <B>Tancred</B>: <font color='#000080'>(But that can be left to Chain Inverness, actually. He's got investigators, let 'em bloody well investigate.)</font><br>
[Sat Feb 26 20:14:03 2005] : <B>Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>(Right. If you choose that route, the Inverness fortune would make things easier.)</font><br>
[Sat Feb 26 20:14:39 2005] : <B>Tancred</B>: <font color='#000080'>(Well, we'll see what Arno thinks of all this. But I'm still leaning toward going to Chaos. Adrian?)</font><br>

[Sat Feb 26 20:16:42 2005] : <B>Tancred</B>: <font color='#000080'>(Well, let's call it that, then. Sounds like fun. Tancred also wants Arno to suggest to Chain that they tip off Ilium Watch about the Reicherts. Quietly, of course.)</font><br>
[Sat Feb 26 20:17:04 2005] : <B>Tancred</B>: <font color='#000080'>(Tancred, like Renate, believes in going at a problem from as many directions and with as much backup as possible.)</font><br>

[Sat Feb 26 20:19:41 2005] : <B>Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>Personally, I like those guys, though.</font><br>

[Sat Feb 26 20:21:05 2005] : <B>Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>So you have to love that.</font><br>
[Sat Feb 26 20:21:09 2005] : <B>Tancred</B>: <font color='#000080'>I didn't think she did love songs.</font><br>
[Sat Feb 26 20:21:20 2005] : <B>Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>He was being sarcastic. Although she did do a (horrible) duet with Ozzy.</font><br>
