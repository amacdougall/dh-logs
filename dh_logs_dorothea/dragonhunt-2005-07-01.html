[Fri Jul 01 20:43:33 2005] : <B>Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>"To my mind," Renate sighs, "there are three issues at hand: a theological issue which I have no status or inclination to weigh in on; a criminal issue, ditto; and a serious Church-internal organizational problem, which is what I hope to spur reform of."</font><br>
[Fri Jul 01 20:44:11 2005] : <B>Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>"I am inclined to see what resolution the criminal issue requires, first, in hopes of reclaiming Adam to help with the organizational problems."</font><br>

[Fri Jul 01 20:45:52 2005] : <B>Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>"But whatever happens to Adam, the Church is still in trouble, Sabra -- so in that sense, yes, I have larger concerns than Adam."</font><br>

[Fri Jul 01 20:46:56 2005] : <B>Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>"First off, we already did a full-scale sweep of Adam's workplace, home, and known haunts. We interrogated all his contacts, we leaned on people we could lean on."</font><br>

[Fri Jul 01 20:49:05 2005] : <B>Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>"Yes, and that's where we got our lead: there's an underground pipeline that carries certain types of political fugitives in and out of Andragar, to take advantage of some of the trickier laws of extradition and immunity."</font><br>
[Fri Jul 01 20:49:43 2005] : <B>Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>"I see," Renate says, filing that information away for her own purposes. "Go on."</font><br>
[Fri Jul 01 20:49:48 2005] : <B>Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>"For years, that pipeline operated under a variety of independent 'businessmen,' loosely connected to the underworld, but engaging in no other crimes."</font><br>

[Fri Jul 01 21:51:38 2005] : <B>Aryk</B>: <font color='#000080'>She could pray for 360 degree sonar vision, or something.  :-)</font><br>

[Fri Jul 01 21:52:38 2005] : <B>Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>She can integrate information from minds all around her, so if there are sufficient people around, yeah, 360-degree vision.</font><br>
