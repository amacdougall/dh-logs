[Thu Mar 16 23:02:40 2006] : <B>(1) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>I'll consult with Justin, who already knows the big picture.</font><br>
[Thu Mar 16 23:02:47 2006] : <B>(1) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>Sorry! You'll find out very soon anyway.</font><br>
[Thu Mar 16 23:03:14 2006] : <B>(1) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>"Wrenfall's Legacy" was originally meant to run as a subquest right before or after Chapter 10, but the trouble is that Aaron has to die of old age before it can happen!</font><br>
[Thu Mar 16 23:03:19 2006] : <B>(3) Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>But the answer to the question you pose is "I don't know." I just don't understand enough of what they're up to to know whether it's consonant with Renate's beliefs.</font><br>
[Thu Mar 16 23:03:25 2006] : <B>(1) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>So I'm worried I'll have to push it back indefinitely.</font><br>

[Thu Mar 16 23:04:03 2006] : <B>(3) Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>So he has a sudden relapse.</font><br>
[Thu Mar 16 23:04:04 2006] : <B>(1) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>I needed to make sure the Aaron + Will = cahoots thing was clear, so I couldn't kill him yet.</font><br>

[Thu Mar 16 23:05:03 2006] : <B>(1) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>Aaron thinks about Renate more than he thinks about Will.</font><br>

[Thu Mar 16 23:05:45 2006] : <B>(1) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>His waking "dreams," as in hopes and long-range plans, are driven by Will, though, which is more what I was hinting at.</font><br>
[Thu Mar 16 23:06:03 2006] : <B>(1) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>Or at least, rely on Will's help.</font><br>
[Thu Mar 16 23:06:04 2006] : <B>(3) Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>Right. Will definitely has some info Renate doesn't.</font><br>

[Thu Mar 16 23:13:06 2006] : <B>(3) Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>Oh, and I finally figured out why Renate dumped Coris.</font><br>

[Thu Mar 16 23:13:49 2006] : <B>(3) Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>And by their lights, it was a reasonably decent thing to do.</font><br>
[Thu Mar 16 23:13:56 2006] : <B>(1) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>He's actually fairly philosophical about stuff. You could argue that by being stoic, he's just hurting himself, but I prefer to say "he's a big boy."</font><br>

[Thu Mar 16 23:16:36 2006] : <B>(3) Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>She never stopped loving him, and she won't. But she loves all the people in her life -- and recognizes that all of them need different things from her.</font><br>
[Thu Mar 16 23:16:48 2006] : <B>(3) Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>So Coris gets to figure out what he wants.</font><br>
[Thu Mar 16 23:17:06 2006] : <B>(3) Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>In the knowledge that "you leave Rien" is totally off the table.</font><br>
[Thu Mar 16 23:18:55 2006] : <B>(1) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>Coris just has a traditional view of romance as being between only two people at a time. He's stuck with how he's wired, as Renate is.</font><br>
[Thu Mar 16 23:19:12 2006] : <B>(3) Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>You think Renate didn't have that view? Of course she did.</font><br>
[Thu Mar 16 23:19:36 2006] : <B>(3) Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>Nobody's stuck with how they're wired. If Renate had to marry someone for political reasons, she would be faithful, because that would be her duty.</font><br>
[Thu Mar 16 23:20:32 2006] : <B>(3) Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>But if Coris can't cope, he can't, and that's fine.</font><br>
[Thu Mar 16 23:20:43 2006] : <B>(1) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>Penny Arcade has a good quote. "When a corporate apologizes, we have a word for that: <i>PR</i>."</font><br>
[Thu Mar 16 23:20:48 2006] : <B>(3) Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>*snerk*</font><br>
[Thu Mar 16 23:20:51 2006] : <B>(1) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>Er, "corporation."</font><br>
[Thu Mar 16 23:22:17 2006] : <B>(3) Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>I think Talos would be happier if Coris and Renate stayed non-lovers anyway.</font><br>
[Thu Mar 16 23:22:25 2006] : <B>(3) Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>Talos thought that was kinda creepy, I think.</font><br>
[Thu Mar 16 23:22:42 2006] : <B>(3) Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>As in "you're twice her age, you cradle-robber!" creepy.</font><br>
[Thu Mar 16 23:23:07 2006] : <B>(1) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>Talos has seen far worse. He's probably just happy it's consensual.</font><br>
[Thu Mar 16 23:23:26 2006] : <B>(1) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>You serve in enough Patchwork Kingdom wars, where people aren't always as disciplined as they might be.</font><br>
[Thu Mar 16 23:23:33 2006] : <B>(3) Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>Indeed.</font><br>
[Thu Mar 16 23:23:35 2006] : <B>(1) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>Then lead a gang, for heaven's sake.</font><br>
[Thu Mar 16 23:23:49 2006] : <B>(1) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>He never presided over things, but he saw things.</font><br>
[Thu Mar 16 23:24:11 2006] : <B>(3) Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>Well, but whether Talos knows it or not, he acts rather paternally toward Renate. At the very least, avuncularly.</font><br>
[Thu Mar 16 23:24:21 2006] : <B>(3) Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>And since Coris is roughly his same generation...</font><br>
[Thu Mar 16 23:24:49 2006] : <B>(1) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>Hm, yeah, he's probably slightly weirded out.</font><br>
[Thu Mar 16 23:26:06 2006] : <B>(3) Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>But we'll see. As far as Renate's concerned, Coris can crawl into bed with her any time he feels like it -- but if he makes it clear they're not lovers, she'll never ask.</font><br>
[Thu Mar 16 23:26:34 2006] : <B>(1) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>Grr. Bastards. Heat "is included" in my rent, which really just means that they decide how much to provide.</font><br>
[Thu Mar 16 23:26:38 2006] : <B>(3) Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>Or behave toward him with any less than the most perfect propriety.</font><br>
[Thu Mar 16 23:26:45 2006] : <B>(3) Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>no thermostat? that sucks</font><br>
[Thu Mar 16 23:26:52 2006] : <B>(1) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>I leave the radiator valve all the way open and hope for the best.</font><br>
[Thu Mar 16 23:26:56 2006] : <B>(3) Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>ugh</font><br>
[Thu Mar 16 23:27:03 2006] : <B>(1) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>Fortunately I have a space heater, but guess what ISN'T included?</font><br>
[Thu Mar 16 23:27:11 2006] : <B>(3) Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>Electricity, of course.</font><br>
[Thu Mar 16 23:27:20 2006] : <B>(1) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>Anything I have control over.</font><br>
[Thu Mar 16 23:27:23 2006] : <B>(3) Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>Invest in fleece.</font><br>
[Thu Mar 16 23:27:28 2006] : <B>(1) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>Except water, which is nice; I can take a hot bath.</font><br>
[Thu Mar 16 23:27:50 2006] : <B>(1) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>Of course the space heater is at my other apartment, and I decided to "rough it" over here for a night.</font><br>
[Thu Mar 16 23:27:59 2006] : <B>(3) Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>have you at least got blankets?</font><br>
[Thu Mar 16 23:28:04 2006] : <B>(1) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>Aye aye.</font><br>
[Thu Mar 16 23:28:12 2006] : <B>(3) Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>Well, good. Go crawl into 'em.</font><br>
[Thu Mar 16 23:28:20 2006] : <B>(3) Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>I'm going to; I have a hell of a long day tomorrow.</font><br>
[Thu Mar 16 23:28:24 2006] : <B>(1) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>Well, I'm at least going to go offline.</font><br>
[Thu Mar 16 23:28:26 2006] : <B>(1) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>See ya!</font><br>
[Thu Mar 16 23:28:29 2006] : <B>(3) Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>bye!</font><br>
[Thu Mar 16 23:28:33 2006] : <B>(1) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>Thanks for picking up the DM slack.</font><br>
[Thu Mar 16 23:28:39 2006] : <B>(3) Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>no prob -- it was fun!</font><br>
