[Fri Jul 21 19:21:44 2006] : <B>(1) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>"Would you like some more tea?" Dr. Joster asks solicitously from across the elegant laquered coffee table.</font><br>
[Fri Jul 21 19:21:53 2006] : <B>(1) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>The couch cushions are almost excessively fluffy.</font><br>
[Fri Jul 21 19:22:33 2006] : <B>(1) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>Despite Tancred's recent treatment&#8212;of which he is blissfully unaware except as a bizarre anecdote&#8212;he has only a mild headache.</font><br>
[Fri Jul 21 19:23:05 2006] : <B>(2) Tancred</B>: <font color='#000080'>"Thank you, yes," says Tancred, as euphoric as he has managed to be on this mad journey. The compulsion is gone, and his hand barely pains him, and the absence of both compulsion and pain is outright blissful.</font><br>
[Fri Jul 21 19:23:08 2006] : <B>(1) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>Sashi was more fortunate; after the grisly "research" on Tancred, the good natural philosopher was able to devise a counter-elixir for Sashi.</font><br>
[Fri Jul 21 19:23:42 2006] : <B>(2) Tancred</B>: <font color='#000080'>"Dr. Joster, do you think Ariadne is aware that Sashi and I are free?"</font><br>
[Fri Jul 21 19:23:49 2006] : <B>(1) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>Her explanation, something absolutely ludicrous about clockwork automatons smaller than needle-tips, quite probably went in one ear and out the other.</font><br>
[Fri Jul 21 19:24:07 2006] : <B>(1) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>(Though of course Tancred would be able to understand the basic idea.)</font><br>
[Fri Jul 21 19:24:59 2006] : <B>(1) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>"It should be impossible. Devices so small cannot transmit data across any distance you could measure with a ruler."</font><br>
[Fri Jul 21 19:25:51 2006] : <B>(2) Tancred</B>: <font color='#000080'>"Hm. I ask because we have a third companion. He is an unreasoning brute, but I cannot quite leave him to her."</font><br>
[Fri Jul 21 19:25:57 2006] : <B>(1) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>"Of course you will have to return to her, regardless... but until my own 'devices' run out of 'juice,' she won't be able to control you the same way again."</font><br>
[Fri Jul 21 19:26:08 2006] : <B>(2) Tancred</B>: <font color='#000080'>"I will... wha-at?"</font><br>
[Fri Jul 21 19:26:59 2006] : <B>(1) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>"She controlled you by placing miniscule automata in your brain, playing your emotions like a puppeteer. The elixir I gave you and Sashi contained similar devices... ones created to battle and defeat the originals."</font><br>
[Fri Jul 21 19:27:09 2006] : <font color='#008000'>** (3) Sashi stands, leaning against a wall, arms folded over her chest.  Her eyes are donig their usual suspicious dart around the room, watching everything at once. **</font><br>
[Fri Jul 21 19:27:29 2006] : <B>(1) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>"As long as those devices hold out, you will be immune to that type of mind control. You have... I would say a week."</font><br>
[Fri Jul 21 19:28:14 2006] : <B>(1) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>"Once their semi-magical force is expended, they will dissolve into harmless natural substances, proteins."</font><br>
[Fri Jul 21 19:28:20 2006] : <B>(1) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>"As if they had never existed."</font><br>
[Fri Jul 21 19:28:35 2006] : <B>(2) Tancred</B>: <font color='#000080'>"But hers... do not dissolve?"</font><br>
[Fri Jul 21 19:28:56 2006] : <B>(1) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>"If this all sounds terribly disturbing, remember it well! This sort of thing is the very reason behind the Technology Accords."</font><br>
[Fri Jul 21 19:29:28 2006] : <B>(1) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>"Hers appear to replenish their power from their host. Like parasites."</font><br>
[Fri Jul 21 19:29:50 2006] : <B>(1) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>"They're very well-designed. My own are crude imitations. In fact, they only work because hers are not designed to withstand attacks."</font><br>
[Fri Jul 21 19:29:57 2006] : <B>(2) Tancred</B>: <font color='#000080'>"But it is not the technology at fault! It is the use to which it is being put. Psychic control is not unknown in Northrock; there are simply different methods of achieving it."</font><br>
[Fri Jul 21 19:30:15 2006] : <B>(1) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>"Without the Technology Accords, imagine every mortal body as a battleground between microscopic machines..."</font><br>
[Fri Jul 21 19:30:44 2006] : <B>(1) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>"This is true. Magic can be just as dangerous. But at least each mind control spell requires a mortal caster, with years of training and effort."</font><br>
[Fri Jul 21 19:30:59 2006] : <B>(1) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>"Not just..." she rubs a thumb and finger together. "Dust in the air."</font><br>
[Fri Jul 21 19:31:08 2006] : <B>(2) Tancred</B>: <font color='#000080'>"How long have you trained to build your laboratory, Dr. Joster? I see no difference."</font><br>
[Fri Jul 21 19:31:32 2006] : <B>(2) Tancred</B>: <font color='#000080'>"Power gains its ends however it seems convenient."</font><br>
[Fri Jul 21 19:32:16 2006] : <B>(1) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>"I see no reason to debate the point. Of course it's up to thinking minds to control the fruits of their efforts."</font><br>
[Fri Jul 21 19:33:03 2006] : <B>(1) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>"One man with a good speaking voice can bring millions to early deaths, as easily as any horror of technology, legal or not."</font><br>
[Fri Jul 21 19:33:28 2006] : <B>(2) Tancred</B>: <font color='#000080'>"Quite so." He sighs. "So how do I convince Ariadne to let me go free? Build her bloody temple?"</font><br>
[Fri Jul 21 19:34:04 2006] : <B>(1) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>"But horrors of illegal technology are my stock in trade, as given to me by special dispensations from the Council... and so you three, if we include your friend, are tied up in my profession for the moment."</font><br>
[Fri Jul 21 19:35:10 2006] : <B>(1) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>"I will deal honestly with you. My machines have already defeated Ariadne's machines, in your bodies. Your mysterious friend, of course, is another matter yet."</font><br>
[Fri Jul 21 19:35:55 2006] : <B>(1) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>"But as long as Ariadne exists, she will still be a threat, will keep spreading her deranged gospel... and I don't have the resources to make an unlimited supply of remedies."</font><br>
[Fri Jul 21 19:36:13 2006] : <B>(1) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>"In fact, I only have the resources for a few more doses."</font><br>
[Fri Jul 21 19:36:29 2006] : <B>(2) Tancred</B>: <font color='#000080'>"I don't see how to make an end of her. She has astonishing resource."</font><br>
[Fri Jul 21 19:36:58 2006] : <B>(2) Tancred</B>: <font color='#000080'>"I am not even quite certain what she <em>is</em>."</font><br>
[Fri Jul 21 19:37:45 2006] : <B>(1) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>"Now, I <i>could</i> report the specifics to the Lakaira Group... they have already seen the Zero Knights forced to a stalemate. They would pay a massive bounty to the Blind Wyrm, or the Iron Claw, or the Chancery of Gears, and see Ariadne's heartcore turned into a klick-wide crater."</font><br>
[Fri Jul 21 19:38:17 2006] : <B>(1) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>"But then knowledge unimaginable would be lost forever... and that is something you, librarian, are oathbound to prevent."</font><br>

[Fri Jul 21 19:39:18 2006] : <B>(2) Tancred</B>: <font color='#000080'>"A key characteristic of knowledge is discoverability anyway -- and that includes rediscoverability."</font><br>

[Fri Jul 21 19:39:57 2006] : <B>(1) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>"I love them and hate them with the same heart; that should be no surprise."</font><br>

[Fri Jul 21 19:40:31 2006] : <B>(1) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>"You know, don't you... that some knowledge must remain forever Sealed away."</font><br>
[Fri Jul 21 19:41:00 2006] : <B>(2) Tancred</B>: <font color='#000080'>"I do not, actually. I know that it must be Sealed until there is good and sufficient reason to release it."</font><br>
[Fri Jul 21 19:41:16 2006] : <B>(2) Tancred</B>: <font color='#000080'>"Reason such as is not expected in my lifetime. But who knows?"</font><br>
[Fri Jul 21 19:41:21 2006] : <B>(1) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>"For some knowledge, I would gladly see 'until there is reason' be 'forever.'"</font><br>
[Fri Jul 21 19:41:50 2006] : <B>(2) Tancred</B>: <font color='#000080'>"But not Ariadne's."</font><br>
[Fri Jul 21 19:43:02 2006] : <B>(1) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>"I have studied beings like your Ariadne; or at least, their long-dead hulls, or ancient unimplemented plans.

[Fri Jul 21 19:43:38 2006] : <B>(1) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>"I think I know how to fight one."</font><br>

[Fri Jul 21 19:45:07 2006] : <B>(1) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>"Their thoughts are like human thoughts: they circle over the same basic concerns, breathe in, regain balance, am I hungry yet, I guess not, breathe out, regain balance... then <i>maybe</i> a conscious thought... a million self-stabilizing processes all at once, like an equation so vast it fills a book, but always equalling zero."</font><br>
[Fri Jul 21 19:46:20 2006] : <B>(1) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>"One analyst compared it to the flight of an airship, sails and rudders and wings forever shifting one centimeter here and there. And if too many mistakes happen, too often... the airship crashes."</font><br>
[Fri Jul 21 19:46:39 2006] : <B>(1) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>"I believe that with the right tools, you can introduce enough errors into Ariadne's thought that her very mind 'crashes.'"</font><br>

[Fri Jul 21 19:50:33 2006] : <B>(1) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>"These instructions could be delivered in many ways, but the most direct is through physical devices... they are usually used to display messages, so the most common word is 'terminus."</font><br>

[Fri Jul 21 22:48:46 2006] : <B>(1) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>Which will wear off in another hour or so.</font><br>
[Fri Jul 21 22:49:08 2006] : <B>(2) Tancred</B>: <font color='#000080'>Still, if Arno had believed the promise about Lucrecia, I think he'd have had enough gumption to at least protest what Tancred was up to.</font><br>
[Fri Jul 21 22:49:38 2006] : <B>(2) Tancred</B>: <font color='#000080'>But maybe in an hour or so he will. Posthumously, so to speak. :)</font><br>
[Fri Jul 21 22:50:43 2006] : <B>(2) Tancred</B>: <font color='#000080'>Poor Tancred. So close, and yet so far.</font><br>
[Fri Jul 21 22:50:50 2006] : <B>(2) Tancred</B>: <font color='#000080'>Alan, did you listen to the mix yet?</font><br>
[Fri Jul 21 22:51:49 2006] : <B>(1) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>Yes, some of it!</font><br>
[Fri Jul 21 22:52:07 2006] : <B>(1) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>And I just got a call from Autumn Blaze, who is eager to fill my dinner spot.</font><br>
[Fri Jul 21 22:52:22 2006] : <B>(2) Tancred</B>: <font color='#000080'>cool</font><br>
[Fri Jul 21 22:52:25 2006] : <B>(1) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>She's a wonderful woman, a lot of fun, very talented poet, so I call it a win.</font><br>
[Fri Jul 21 22:52:57 2006] : <B>(1) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>Yeah, I've listened to about half the mix. Just sort of picking characters and seeing what you chose.</font><br>
[Fri Jul 21 22:53:11 2006] : <B>(2) Tancred</B>: <font color='#000080'>anything grab you?</font><br>
[Fri Jul 21 22:53:45 2006] : <B>(1) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>Actually I kind of like Keph's. The whole "graah graah angry guitar and industrial" thing fits.</font><br>
[Fri Jul 21 22:53:53 2006] : <B>(2) Tancred</B>: <font color='#000080'>yep</font><br>
[Fri Jul 21 22:53:57 2006] : <B>(1) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>And I do really like "One Girl Revolution." It's cute.</font><br>
[Fri Jul 21 22:54:17 2006] : <B>(2) Tancred</B>: <font color='#000080'>yeah, that was Adrian's choice -- I loved it</font><br>
[Fri Jul 21 22:54:35 2006] : <B>(2) Tancred</B>: <font color='#000080'>the riff on the James Bond theme is too much</font><br>
[Fri Jul 21 22:54:40 2006] : <B>(1) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>"Fight for Your Right" seemed a bit too easy. :)</font><br>
[Fri Jul 21 22:55:16 2006] : <B>(2) Tancred</B>: <font color='#000080'>there's a goofy movie from the early '80s called "The Slipper and the Rose"</font><br>
[Fri Jul 21 22:55:27 2006] : <B>(1) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>A bit too much of a representation from graah graah angry guitar bands, actually, but then I would have had too much hip-hop or something.</font><br>
[Fri Jul 21 22:55:32 2006] : <B>(2) Tancred</B>: <font color='#000080'>with a song in it called "Protocoligorically Correct" that I thought of too late for Godfrey</font><br>
[Fri Jul 21 22:55:54 2006] : <B>(2) Tancred</B>: <font color='#000080'>The lyrics work, though.</font><br>
[Fri Jul 21 22:56:01 2006] : <B>(2) Tancred</B>: <font color='#000080'>It's more than just graah graah angry.</font><br>
[Fri Jul 21 22:56:18 2006] : <B>(1) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>Godfrey would choose a highly formal string quartet piece, if he were left to it.</font><br>
[Fri Jul 21 22:56:25 2006] : <B>(2) Tancred</B>: <font color='#000080'>I know he would. :)</font><br>
[Fri Jul 21 22:57:02 2006] : <B>(2) Tancred</B>: <font color='#000080'>One of Mozart's more mathematical pieces. Mozart left emotion for the stuff he wrote for people to sing.</font><br>
[Fri Jul 21 22:57:20 2006] : <B>(1) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>I was listening to some Mozart yesterday, actually, and yeah.</font><br>
[Fri Jul 21 22:57:29 2006] : <B>(1) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>The difference between the choral and string pieces is marked.</font><br>
[Fri Jul 21 22:57:38 2006] : <B>(3) Sashi</B>: <font color='#004000'>Yep, Keph's song is about someone who's a little bit abused (or thinks he is) and is certifiably insane.</font><br>
[Fri Jul 21 22:57:39 2006] : <B>(2) Tancred</B>: <font color='#000080'>did you give a listen to Emily Rani's song?</font><br>
[Fri Jul 21 22:57:54 2006] : <B>(1) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>I saw the words "Green Day" and decided to leave it for last.</font><br>
[Fri Jul 21 22:57:58 2006] : <B>(2) Tancred</B>: <font color='#000080'>heh</font><br>
[Fri Jul 21 22:58:01 2006] : <B>(2) Tancred</B>: <font color='#000080'>give a listen</font><br>
[Fri Jul 21 22:58:03 2006] : <B>(3) Sashi</B>: <font color='#004000'>:P</font><br>
[Fri Jul 21 22:58:04 2006] : <B>(2) Tancred</B>: <font color='#000080'>go on, we'll wait</font><br>
[Fri Jul 21 22:58:16 2006] : <B>(2) Tancred</B>: <font color='#000080'>I actually liked the Green Day songs. I guess I suck.</font><br>
[Fri Jul 21 22:58:34 2006] : <B>(1) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>There's nothing really wrong with Green Day, I just don't like them much.</font><br>
[Fri Jul 21 22:58:37 2006] : <B>(1) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>It's a preference.</font><br>
[Fri Jul 21 22:59:03 2006] : <B>(1) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>I like plenty of stuff I wouldn't call "good," and dislike plenty of stuff that is good.</font><br>
[Fri Jul 21 22:59:20 2006] : <B>(2) Tancred</B>: <font color='#000080'>well, so fire up iTunes or whatever and listen to "She's a Rebel"</font><br>
[Fri Jul 21 22:59:24 2006] : <B>(1) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>Dorothy Durai's song shows too much self-awareness. :)</font><br>
[Fri Jul 21 22:59:30 2006] : <B>(2) Tancred</B>: <font color='#000080'>lol!</font><br>
[Fri Jul 21 22:59:33 2006] : <B>(1) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>WinAmp 4 LIFE here.</font><br>
[Fri Jul 21 22:59:47 2006] : <B>(2) Tancred</B>: <font color='#000080'>Renate will be nicer to her the next time they meet. It's just that she felt Dorothy shouldn't always have things her own way.</font><br>
[Fri Jul 21 22:59:52 2006] : <B>(1) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>I like the singer; her voice kind of sounds like the girl from Sister Soleil.</font><br>
[Fri Jul 21 23:00:34 2006] : <B>(2) Tancred</B>: <font color='#000080'>I mean, Renate had her FIRST ADVANTAGE EVER over Dorothy Durai. No way was she not going to press it.</font><br>
[Fri Jul 21 23:00:54 2006] : <B>(1) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>And you may never know if she cared.</font><br>
[Fri Jul 21 23:01:05 2006] : <B>(2) Tancred</B>: <font color='#000080'>Eh, I still think we'll hook up in Vollis.</font><br>
[Fri Jul 21 23:01:11 2006] : <B>(2) Tancred</B>: <font color='#000080'>Renate hasn't given up.</font><br>
[Fri Jul 21 23:02:05 2006] : <B>(1) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>Emily's song does fit. Actually, there's a great Brando line from "The Wild One" that applies...</font><br>
[Fri Jul 21 23:02:17 2006] : <B>(1) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>Someone asks him "What are you rebelling against?" And he yells, "What have you got?"</font><br>
[Fri Jul 21 23:02:21 2006] : <B>(2) Tancred</B>: <font color='#000080'>exactly</font><br>
[Fri Jul 21 23:03:54 2006] : <B>(2) Tancred</B>: <font color='#000080'>I admit that the cheap slap at Colette was mine.</font><br>
[Fri Jul 21 23:04:49 2006] : <B>(3) Sashi</B>: <font color='#004000'>Which was just as well, because all I could think of for her was Cindi Lauper and "Girls Just Wanna Have Fun."</font><br>
[Fri Jul 21 23:05:00 2006] : <B>(2) Tancred</B>: <font color='#000080'>heh</font><br>
[Fri Jul 21 23:06:02 2006] : <B>(1) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>Hm. I am pretty sure I could have found a song where she's saying "yeah, I put on the face you expect, and rock the glitz and high heels; you want to talk to me about my 'real' personality? You'll <i>never know</i> unless I want you to."</font><br>
[Fri Jul 21 23:06:11 2006] : <B>(2) Tancred</B>: <font color='#000080'>go ahead!</font><br>
[Fri Jul 21 23:06:17 2006] : <B>(2) Tancred</B>: <font color='#000080'>we're not limited to just the one mix ;)</font><br>
[Fri Jul 21 23:06:23 2006] : <B>(3) Sashi</B>: <font color='#004000'>Indeed.</font><br>
[Fri Jul 21 23:06:38 2006] : <B>(3) Sashi</B>: <font color='#004000'>Besides, there's character interaction songs to do still</font><br>
[Fri Jul 21 23:06:41 2006] : <B>(1) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>I'll ask my friend Amy. She's a walking encylopedia of lesbian alt-rock.</font><br>
[Fri Jul 21 23:06:50 2006] : <B>(1) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>I'm sure that's the subgenre most likely to have those songs.</font><br>
[Fri Jul 21 23:06:58 2006] : <B>(2) Tancred</B>: <font color='#000080'>prolly</font><br>
[Fri Jul 21 23:08:01 2006] : <B>(2) Tancred</B>: <font color='#000080'>but I'm dead sure you can't find better songs for Emily Rani or Renate :)</font><br>
[Fri Jul 21 23:08:15 2006] : <B>(2) Tancred</B>: <font color='#000080'>or the old Rien -- that was a very good choice</font><br>
[Fri Jul 21 23:10:38 2006] : <B>(1) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>Christ. Kinky Friedman is running for governor of Texas!</font><br>
[Fri Jul 21 23:10:44 2006] : <B>(1) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>That would be awesomer than cake!</font><br>
[Fri Jul 21 23:10:45 2006] : <B>(2) Tancred</B>: <font color='#000080'>huh?</font><br>
[Fri Jul 21 23:10:51 2006] : <B>(3) Sashi</B>: <font color='#004000'>who?</font><br>
[Fri Jul 21 23:11:20 2006] : <B>(1) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>A novelist, humorist, essayist. Larger than life. WAY larger than life.</font><br>
[Fri Jul 21 23:11:35 2006] : <B>(1) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>Jewish as hell, which automatically means he can't be governor of Texas.</font><br>
[Fri Jul 21 23:11:46 2006] : <B>(2) Tancred</B>: <font color='#000080'>indeed</font><br>
[Fri Jul 21 23:11:47 2006] : <B>(1) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>There's probably even a law that says he has to be burned at the stake.</font><br>
[Fri Jul 21 23:12:07 2006] : <B>(1) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>But it's totally sweet that he's running.</font><br>
