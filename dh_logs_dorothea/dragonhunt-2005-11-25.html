[Fri Nov 25 19:03:42 2005] : <B>(1) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>I can see that, but be well aware that (at least here in the US) if you don't go from freshman to bachelor's in one straight shot, your chances of ever getting the diploma drop precipitously.</font><br>

[Fri Nov 25 19:05:19 2005] : <B>(3) Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>it's also true that students who get their BA/BS later in life tend to appreciate it more and get more out of it</font><br>

[Fri Nov 25 19:07:18 2005] : <B>(1) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>Then again, if you get a job as a networking specialist, who says you'll need a degree? Certifications and job experience count as much.</font><br>
[Fri Nov 25 19:07:43 2005] : <B>(2) Rien</B>: <font color='#004040'>Thy count as all, in the end.  And if your employer wants you to learn more, then they can pay for it</font><br>

[Fri Nov 25 19:08:46 2005] : <B>(3) Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>well, this is true -- what the bachelor's is for is self-defense</font><br>

[Fri Nov 25 19:09:08 2005] : <B>(2) Rien</B>: <font color='#004040'>that'd have to be all, because a networking bachelours is useless nad everyone knows it</font><br>

[Fri Nov 25 19:10:09 2005] : <B>(1) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>Well, let's hope there's a cultural difference between Australia and the US, because over here, not having that diploma can make you look less dedicated or intelligent, even if all it <i>really</i> means is less privileged.</font><br>
