[Fri Aug  4 19:32:37 2006] : <font color='#008000'>** (4) Aryk taps his foot against Renate's under the table. **</font><br>
[Fri Aug  4 19:32:38 2006] : <B>(2) Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>"Blessings upon you as well, Master Salisbury. I no longer hold any title, though."</font><br>
[Fri Aug  4 19:32:39 2006] : <B>(1) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>His thin gray sweater is wrinkled; he fumbles around in a pocket for spectacles.</font><br>
[Fri Aug  4 19:32:59 2006] : <B>(2) Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>"May I make you a cup of tea?"</font><br>
[Fri Aug  4 19:33:32 2006] : <B>(1) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>"Ah, my ap, apologies. I have a deeper sight than some, and I felt old patterns in your mind. So you are recently come upon straitened, ah, straits? My sympathy."</font><br>
[Fri Aug  4 19:34:27 2006] : <B>(2) Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>"None is needed. My father had a difficult decision to make, and he made it."</font><br>
[Fri Aug  4 19:34:30 2006] : <B>(1) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>"I know the feel of quick-changing times. I am a, ah, monastic, of Lisanne." He sketches a holy sign.</font><br>
[Fri Aug  4 19:35:06 2006] : <B>(1) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>"My ah, actual monastery, though, is no more, so... it is not much the same. But it was who I was, if you see."</font><br>
[Fri Aug  4 19:35:18 2006] : <B>(2) Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>"Yes, I do see. I am sorry."</font><br>
[Fri Aug  4 19:35:19 2006] : <B>(1) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>"When those things change, for any of us, we must find, ah, new anchors."</font><br>
[Fri Aug  4 19:35:42 2006] : <B>(2) Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>"What was it you made, if I may ask?"</font><br>
[Fri Aug  4 19:36:15 2006] : <font color='#008000'>** (4) Aryk nods with sympathy toward the man. **</font><br>

[Fri Aug  4 19:37:56 2006] : <B>(1) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>"So ah, though surely new paths, new <i>ways</i> of living, we all, from my old monastery, go on living. Some in, ah, the Celestium, of course."</font><br>
[Fri Aug  4 19:38:15 2006] : <B>(1) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>He smiles nervously; he doesn't seem to be nervous <i>about</i> anything.</font><br>
[Fri Aug  4 19:38:32 2006] : <B>(2) Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>"A pity you are scattered. Had you not thought of establishing a new monastery?"</font><br>
[Fri Aug  4 19:38:44 2006] : <B>(1) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>(Lisanne, as Aryk knows, is the angel of the forge, armorer of the Sacred World.)</font><br>

[Fri Aug  4 19:39:09 2006] : <B>(1) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>(This is probably common knowledge, actually.)</font><br>
[Fri Aug  4 19:39:12 2006] : <B>(1) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>(Right.)</font><br>
[Fri Aug  4 19:39:41 2006] : <font color='#008000'>** (2) Renate arises, pouring Salisbury a cup of boiling water from the kettle with only a little hesitation here and there. **</font><br>
[Fri Aug  4 19:39:42 2006] : <B>(1) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>"I ah, have found a new calling, a new hammer and tongs."</font><br>
[Fri Aug  4 19:40:03 2006] : <B>(4) Aryk</B>: <font color='#000080'>"Were there a lot of followers of Lisanne here when the monastery was still around?"</font><br>
[Fri Aug  4 19:40:07 2006] : <B>(1) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>"This place seems so little, in reality, but in truth is as large as minds to explore it."</font><br>
[Fri Aug  4 19:41:04 2006] : <B>(1) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>"Oh ah, hah, well, I am from far south of here... I came" (He stops so suddenly punctuation would seem incorrect.) He tosses a pinch of tea into his cup to let it steep.</font><br>
[Fri Aug  4 19:41:47 2006] : <B>(1) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>"I came here after the earthquake. I was always interested in the arts of the mind," he says, regaining his concentration.</font><br>
[Fri Aug  4 19:42:27 2006] : <B>(1) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>He smiles and slouches comfortably. "You could say that it was easy to go from a life of meditation, to a life of, shall we say, studying meditation."</font><br>
[Fri Aug  4 19:43:07 2006] : <B>(1) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>"Sir Aryk, I am sure you understand," he says with a wink. "Your studies must have covered a great deal of psychology, am I right?"</font><br>
[Fri Aug  4 19:43:26 2006] : <B>(4) Aryk</B>: <font color='#000080'>"...."</font><br>
[Fri Aug  4 19:43:30 2006] : <B>(4) Aryk</B>: <font color='#000080'>"...Yes."</font><br>
[Fri Aug  4 19:43:54 2006] : <B>(1) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>"Once you master your own mind through meditation and prayer, you can learn to understand others."</font><br>
[Fri Aug  4 19:44:08 2006] : <B>(4) Aryk</B>: <font color='#000080'>"Oh, prayer... sure, we did a lot of that, of course."</font><br>
[Fri Aug  4 19:44:40 2006] : <B>(4) Aryk</B>: <font color='#000080'>"But... you're saying that prayer allows one to... master their own minds, as well?"</font><br>
[Fri Aug  4 19:44:43 2006] : <B>(1) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>He takes a deep breath of the steeping tea vapors. "Ah, wonderful... good tea is one of the things I often miss. The mental world has anything we can imagine, of course, but sometimes the imagination itself is lacking."</font><br>
[Fri Aug  4 19:45:09 2006] : <B>(2) Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>"Please enjoy," Renate says, adding casually, "Where did you say you were from?"</font><br>
[Fri Aug  4 19:46:28 2006] : <B>(1) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>"Derentford, a town a few kilometers to the south of the Sunese border. It was part of this kingdom or that&#8212;you know how it is. Prone to earthquakes, but still, we thought ourselves quite safe..."</font><br>
[Fri Aug  4 19:46:57 2006] : <B>(1) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>He shrugs. "I forgot to introduce myself fully. My name is Brilliance Salisbury&#8212;my parents were ever so optimistic. Call me Sal if you like."</font><br>
[Fri Aug  4 19:48:18 2006] : <B>(2) Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>"Oh. I am <em>so</em> sorry. How long have you been here?"</font><br>
[Fri Aug  4 19:49:07 2006] : <B>(1) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>"Ever since the master began to gather his students. You understand his condition?"</font><br>
[Fri Aug  4 19:49:31 2006] : <B>(2) Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>"I have been told, yes."</font><br>
[Fri Aug  4 19:49:38 2006] : <B>(1) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>"He"</font><br>
[Fri Aug  4 19:49:48 2006] : <B>(2) Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>"Though I could wish Grandmaster Kumori had been more forthcoming."</font><br>
[Fri Aug  4 19:49:50 2006] : <B>(1) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>"He, ah... rededicated his life, you see."</font><br>
[Fri Aug  4 19:50:03 2006] : <B>(4) Aryk</B>: <font color='#000080'>"If you call death a 'condition'," Aryk remarks to Rien.</font><br>
[Fri Aug  4 19:50:06 2006] : <B>(1) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>Salisbury blows on the surface of his tea to cool it enough for a sip.</font><br>
[Fri Aug  4 19:51:05 2006] : <B>(1) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>"To teaching. He thinks, maybe, the dragon ahh <i>need</i> for conquest is based on their physiology, a neurochemical thing maybe, or glandular..."</font><br>
[Fri Aug  4 19:51:42 2006] : <B>(1) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>"...but ever since he, ah, transcended, he has found his strength in the forging of the blade, not the swinging, as we would say."</font><br>
[Fri Aug  4 19:51:52 2006] : <B>(1) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>"No offense," he says with a grimace at Aryk.</font><br>
[Fri Aug  4 19:52:28 2006] : <B>(2) Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>"I don't know that it is necessary to presume a bodily cause," Renate says. "Generations of dragons have built an entire society from conquest. Such social structures are extremely difficult to change or escape."</font><br>
[Fri Aug  4 19:53:12 2006] : <B>(3) Rien</B>: <font color='#004000'>"Especially if the desire to change them isn't there in the first place."</font><br>
[Fri Aug  4 19:53:18 2006] : <B>(1) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>Ricard mumbles in Aryk's mind, "I just checked on this character. He was a monk dedicated to Lisanne, but the last time he truly prayed was twelve years ago. The sacred rolls list him as having left the faith."</font><br>
[Fri Aug  4 19:53:20 2006] : <B>(4) Aryk</B>: <font color='#000080'>"Why does everyone make comments about simplicity or brute force, and then look at me and be like, 'oh, hey, no offense?!' "</font><br>
[Fri Aug  4 19:53:40 2006] : <B>(4) Aryk</B>: <font color='#000080'>"Huh... that's funny," Aryk ponders, aloud on accident.</font><br>
[Fri Aug  4 19:53:53 2006] : <B>(1) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>"It happens," Ricard continues. "Men have free will. But if he says he believes, yet his prayers are not heard in the Above, then perhaps he is deceiving himself."</font><br>
[Fri Aug  4 19:54:25 2006] : <B>(2) Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>"I'm sorry, Aryk?"</font><br>
[Fri Aug  4 19:54:43 2006] : <B>(1) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>"Yes," Salisbury responds to Renate. "There are, ah, habits that are probably hard for any dragon to break."</font><br>
[Fri Aug  4 19:55:32 2006] : <B>(1) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>"But we are discovering so much here... maybe this is all preparation for some great war of mental conquest, he just laughs off that one when we, ah, ask him, we <i>do</i> ask these things..."</font><br>
[Fri Aug  4 19:55:52 2006] : <B>(4) Aryk</B>: <font color='#000080'>"So, Sal," says Aryk, leaning forward, "I imagine that after you lost your temple, you probably erected some sort of personal monument to her.  At least one you could pray to yourself.  I understand some of the monks here who travel often actually bring small shrines with them on their journeys to pray to when there are no temples about."</font><br>
[Fri Aug  4 19:56:23 2006] : <B>(1) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>"But if so, even a decade of peace, from a dragon, you know...?" he asks of Renate (before turning to listen to Aryk's question).</font><br>
[Fri Aug  4 19:56:42 2006] : <B>(2) Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>"Is unusual," Renate murmurs.</font><br>
[Fri Aug  4 19:57:18 2006] : <B>(1) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>"Yes, you are ah, exactly right, and on a larger scale than you think! You see, this mental world we all visit, it has, ah, permanent artifacts and structures, stored in magical reservoirs of thought, to be summoned in a blink."</font><br>
[Fri Aug  4 19:57:41 2006] : <B>(1) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>"I have drawn plans and mentally constructed a cathedral to Lisanne, purely, ah, 'imaginary,' but real to me."</font><br>
[Fri Aug  4 19:58:03 2006] : <B>(4) Aryk</B>: <font color='#000080'>"Does that really count, though?  I mean, if I drink some imaginary tea, sure, I think it tastes good, but it doesn't nourish me."</font><br>
[Fri Aug  4 19:58:54 2006] : <font color='#008000'>** (2) Renate shakes herself mentally, preparing to play Aryk's backup if need be. **</font><br>
[Fri Aug  4 19:59:25 2006] : <B>(1) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>"Of course, but is not prayer, ah, mental in nature? And spiritual? And the seat of the spirit is the mind, not the body."</font><br>
[Fri Aug  4 19:59:42 2006] : <B>(2) Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>She finds the collective hallucination, the calm acceptance of mental tampering, highly unsavory.</font><br>
[Fri Aug  4 20:00:01 2006] : <B>(1) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>"That is proven in the doctrines of Saint, ah, Sevate."</font><br>
[Fri Aug  4 20:01:05 2006] : <B>(4) Aryk</B>: <font color='#000080'>"Yeah, that's a good point.  But, honestly, I think it takes a bit more than that to get your message across.  My friend tells me you haven't prayed in twelve years.  I believe you have.  But I'm worried, perhaps... they don't."</font><br>
[Fri Aug  4 20:02:06 2006] : <B>(4) Aryk</B>: <font color='#000080'>"You can donate all the imaginary money you want, and sing all the imaginary hymnals, and even scrub all the imaginary pews when all the imaginary followers of Lisanne leave after the service... but you're not actually doing any of that."</font><br>
[Fri Aug  4 20:02:45 2006] : <B>(2) Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>"Are your prayers answered, Salisbury?" Renate asks with polite simplicity.</font><br>
[Fri Aug  4 20:03:12 2006] : <B>(1) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>"I don't know. I have not prayed <i>for</i> anything in a long time."</font><br>
[Fri Aug  4 20:03:49 2006] : <B>(4) Aryk</B>: <font color='#000080'>"Mm.  Then maybe you're a luckier man than I, friend."</font><br>
[Fri Aug  4 20:04:21 2006] : <B>(1) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>"Perhaps I should try. A simple prayer for light."</font><br>
[Fri Aug  4 20:05:11 2006] : <B>(1) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>He holds out his hands and chants softly in the temple tongue; and a red-orange glow, like the heart of a forge, seeps into the air between them. It is not a globe of light, or a flame, but simply a brightness in the air which casts shadows.</font><br>
[Fri Aug  4 20:05:44 2006] : <font color='#008000'>** (3) Rien narrows his eyes slightly, tipping his head to the side. **</font><br>
[Fri Aug  4 20:05:45 2006] : <B>(4) Aryk</B>: <font color='#000080'>"Excellent."  Aryk thinks to Ricard, "You see, friend... this one still has faith."</font><br>
[Fri Aug  4 20:05:51 2006] : <B>(1) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>Ricard says to Aryk, "That was real."</font><br>
[Fri Aug  4 20:06:30 2006] : <B>(1) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>"But I am worried... this place is too confusing for me, and I cannot follow you too far into their mental world. I think it is best if I retreat to the Sacred World for now."</font><br>
[Fri Aug  4 20:06:57 2006] : <B>(2) Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>"When should we expect Keniuchio back?" Renate asks, to cover Aryk's momentary absorption.</font><br>
[Fri Aug  4 20:07:07 2006] : <B>(4) Aryk</B>: <font color='#000080'>"Okay..." says Aryk in his mind, with an edge of nervousness.</font><br>
[Fri Aug  4 20:08:32 2006] : <B>(1) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>"He is almost here. Ah, and Kaplan and Jodie have almost completed their experiment, and the master should be free then."</font><br>
[Fri Aug  4 20:08:49 2006] : <B>(1) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>"This ah, tea... it <i>is</i> good, isn't it?"</font><br>
[Fri Aug  4 20:09:15 2006] : <B>(2) Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>"I wasn't drinking that particular blend," Renate demurs.</font><br>
[Fri Aug  4 20:09:24 2006] : <B>(2) Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>"It smells good, though."</font><br>
[Fri Aug  4 20:09:45 2006] : <B>(1) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>The door to the outside slams open, and wind curls into the quarters. "I'm <i>hoooooome!</i>"</font><br>
[Fri Aug  4 20:10:47 2006] : <B>(1) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>A short human stumbles into the outer room; all you can make out is that he has turned unshaven-ness into an artform, being barely shy of a beard, moustache, and mutton-chops.</font><br>
[Fri Aug  4 20:11:23 2006] : <font color='#008000'>** (4) Aryk jumps from his chair as an automatic reaction. **</font><br>
[Fri Aug  4 20:11:26 2006] : <B>(1) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>Instead, he just has a terrible scraggly fuzz at all angles. He collapses into a beanbag without even taking off his parka.</font><br>
[Fri Aug  4 20:11:49 2006] : <B>(1) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>"The Brain," Keniuchio says dryly, taking off his own winter clothes and shaking snow off his spindly goblin legs.</font><br>
[Fri Aug  4 20:12:38 2006] : <B>(1) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>"Don't let his demeanor put you off. He's capable of deeper thought than any of us. Seems all his other potential is wasted."</font><br>
[Fri Aug  4 20:12:45 2006] : <B>(2) Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>"Would that be Lord Brain? Sir Brain? Master Brain?" Renate asks drily.</font><br>

[Fri Aug  4 20:15:13 2006] : <B>(1) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>"He isn't terribly sociable, though, so we don't call him much of anything. Not many opportunities. He's always off in some personal world engaging in some sort of elaborate mental experiment."</font><br>

When you specifically start looking at things like detail level, it becomes clear that a few environments, particularly La Hacienda and the Sunese mountain replica where you talked to Forengil, are drawn at a higher granularity and precision.</font><br>
