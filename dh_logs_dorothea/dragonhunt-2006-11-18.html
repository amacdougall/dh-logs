[Sat Nov 18 11:28:43 2006] : <font color='#008000'>** (1) Aryk has no means of ressurecting her.  His only technique he could possibly use requires too much buildup.  He drops beside Rien. **</font><br>
[Sat Nov 18 11:28:57 2006] : <B>(1) Aryk</B>: <font color='#a40000'>"RENNIE!  That bow!  That fucking bow!"</font><br>
[Sat Nov 18 11:29:36 2006] : <B>(2) Alan</B>: <font color='#000000'>Kip shakes his head, casting a backward glance. "She's deader than good manners, friends. I can't see her soul."</font><br>
[Sat Nov 18 11:29:38 2006] : <font color='#008000'>** (3) Rien finds no pulse, as he knew he wouldn't.  He gives a soft little sounds in the back of his throat as his hands curl together in his lap.  He freezes, so still he isn't even breathing. **</font><br>
[Sat Nov 18 11:29:46 2006] : <B>(2) Alan</B>: <font color='#000000'>"What bow would you be talking about?"</font><br>
[Sat Nov 18 11:30:25 2006] : <B>(1) Aryk</B>: <font color='#a40000'>Aryk stands up in a flash and graps Kip's shirt.  "Aurashin!  The Dark Professor!  Find him, NOW!"</font><br>

[Sat Nov 18 11:33:59 2006] : <font color='#008000'>** (3) Rien has his eyes closed, his entire posture curled in on itself. **</font><br>
[Sat Nov 18 11:34:08 2006] : <B>(2) Alan</B>: <font color='#000000'>Kip's Bluebloods don't seem terribly inclined to follow orders; after minor physical posturing, they turn around and head back toward the buildings with an attitude of greatest nonchalance.</font><br>
[Sat Nov 18 11:34:37 2006] : <B>(1) Aryk</B>: <font color='#a40000'>Aryk can't wait for Rien to snap out of it.  Nor does he blame him.  Even though he thinks he knows the outcome, he tries to revive Renate.</font><br>
[Sat Nov 18 11:35:41 2006] : <font color='#008000'>** (1) Aryk only pauses a moment to growl quietly at the Bluebloods.  Renate is far more important, now. **</font><br>
[Sat Nov 18 11:35:56 2006] : <B>(1) Aryk</B>: <font color='#a40000'>"Rien... Rien... can you do anything?!"</font><br>
[Sat Nov 18 11:38:10 2006] : <B>(3) Rien</B>: <font color='#004000'>Without opening his eyes, Rien says is a distant voice, "take her inside, get her somewhere comfortable, and warm," his voice deepens, a growl entering his words.  His eyes open slowly, burning a deep, sooty red, the smoke pouring down his face like tears, "And do not try to remove that arrow.  No one is to touch it, or her."</font><br>
[Sat Nov 18 11:38:58 2006] : <B>(1) Aryk</B>: <font color='#a40000'>Aryk nods earnestly.  "Rien... you're better off at finding Aurashin than I am.  Hurry, brother.  Hurry."</font><br>

[Sat Nov 18 11:39:16 2006] : <font color='#008000'>** (1) Aryk has never seemed so sincere. **</font><br>
[Sat Nov 18 11:40:21 2006] : <font color='#ff8000'> ** Sorry, don't understand what a /mr is...</font><br>
[Sat Nov 18 11:40:30 2006] : <font color='#008000'>** (3) Rien growls softly, the snow around him melting to a muddy puddle, boiling off to steam, as Rien rises to his feet, and stalks off towards the buildings, heated air tugging at his air and clothes. **</font><br>
[Sat Nov 18 11:41:21 2006] : <B>(2) Alan</B>: <font color='#000000'>Rien runs into Kip and Aurashin exiting the Yujishima Building in a hurry, with several of Aurashin's students trailing behind.</font><br>
[Sat Nov 18 11:42:15 2006] : <font color='#008000'>** (1) Aryk gently moves Renate's body back toward the nearest building or shed. **</font><br>
[Sat Nov 18 11:44:00 2006] : <font color='#008000'>** (3) Rien wordlessly points them towards Aryk, and then follows them. **</font><br>
[Sat Nov 18 11:44:08 2006] : <B>(2) Alan</B>: <font color='#000000'>"Master Sandriano informs me that Renate fell out of thin air, dead with a black arrow through her chest. I assure you that this cannot be the work of the item I showed you earlier. I had just returned from its place of storage as Master Sandriano accosted me."</font><br>
[Sat Nov 18 11:45:15 2006] : <B>(2) Alan</B>: <font color='#000000'>"For the past fifteen minutes, I have been in direct contact with it. Once I determine Renate's time of death, we will be able to verify the item's, shall we say 'alibi', more exactly."</font><br>
[Sat Nov 18 11:46:01 2006] : <B>(2) Alan</B>: <font color='#000000'>"I say this not to clear myself of carelessness, but to preserve hope that Renate's plight is of a less exceptional nature."</font><br>
[Sat Nov 18 11:46:08 2006] : <B>(1) Aryk</B>: <font color='#a40000'>Aryk has laid Renate out across some straw with a blanket over it inside the nearest shed.  "How can you say that, Professor?  There's a friggin' arrow in her chest! Her soul is GONE!  Can't you feel it!"  Tears are pouring freely down Aryk's face.</font><br>
[Sat Nov 18 11:46:43 2006] : <font color='#008000'>** (3) Rien doesn't reply, but he gives a snarl as Kip steps a little too close to Renate for his liking. **</font><br>

[Sat Nov 18 11:47:34 2006] : <B>(2) Alan</B>: <font color='#000000'>"I can," he says, appearing deeply troubled now that he sees Renate's body. "Her state definitely appears to be the work of the bow. Master Sandriano, you may as well be in on this secret&#8212;there is an artifact of utmost vileness present on campus, an artifact I have been working to destroy. It is a bow with the ability to trap the souls of those it slays."</font><br>
[Sat Nov 18 11:48:12 2006] : <B>(2) Alan</B>: <font color='#000000'>"I have no reason whatever to trust you in general terms, but I know enough of your creed to believe you would not covet such a device, nor provide it to those who would."</font><br>
[Sat Nov 18 11:48:40 2006] : <font color='#008000'>** (1) Aryk flashes an inquiring and slightly unpleasant look at Kip. **</font><br>
[Sat Nov 18 11:49:08 2006] : <B>(2) Alan</B>: <font color='#000000'>The professor returns his attention to Renate, and traces a series of small figures in the air, his finger leaving a faint trail of red light.</font><br>
[Sat Nov 18 11:50:20 2006] : <B>(2) Alan</B>: <font color='#000000'>"Time of death, now minus seventeen minutes. This means that she was killed while I was working on the bow. I acknowledge that this makes me the prime suspect. I am willing to remand myself to your custody if you do not trust my plea of innocence."</font><br>
[Sat Nov 18 11:51:00 2006] : <B>(2) Alan</B>: <font color='#000000'>"I suggest, however, that if I am innocent, my assistance is likely to be essential."</font><br>

[Sat Nov 18 11:52:32 2006] : <B>(2) Alan</B>: <font color='#000000'>Sandriano shakes his head. "Tons of easier and sneakier ways you could have killed her, Prof. Unless this bow thing can possess people like a sorcery staff, this wasn't a plausible method."</font><br>
[Sat Nov 18 11:53:59 2006] : <B>(2) Alan</B>: <font color='#000000'>The professor shakes his head. "I confess to near-total mystification, but perhaps with a shred of a lead, we can worry free a clue."</font><br>

[Sat Nov 18 12:32:42 2006] : <B>(2) Alan</B>: <font color='#000000'>"The netherworld should not be confused with the Celestium. For the most part, it does not contain the souls of the departed."</font><br>

Just like the Spirit World, it is an abstract reflection of the reality of the physical world; and like the Spirit World, it is not strongly bound in time, no more than in space."</font><br>
[Sat Nov 18 12:35:05 2006] : <B>(2) Alan</B>: <font color='#000000'>"When a necromancer makes contact with a spirit of the dead, there are two possibilities: first, that he has contacted an actual spirit which is making its way to the Celestium."</font><br>
[Sat Nov 18 12:35:48 2006] : <B>(2) Alan</B>: <font color='#000000'>"Second, and much more likely, that he is viewing a timeloose reflection of that spirit. Consider it an astral 'echo' of the mind of the deceased."</font><br>
[Sat Nov 18 12:36:47 2006] : <B>(2) Alan</B>: <font color='#000000'>"There is a third possibility, my area of expertise: a necromancer might make contact with a ghost, a spirit that has not passed into the Celestium when it should have."</font><br>

[Sat Nov 18 14:53:58 2006] : <B>(3) Rien</B>: <font color='#004000'>But that's just my opinion.</font><br>

[Sat Nov 18 14:56:34 2006] : <B>(2) Alan</B>: <font color='#000000'>A local beer. A light crisp ale. Extremely drinkable.</font><br>
[Sat Nov 18 14:56:36 2006] : <B>(4) Aryk</B>: <font color='#a40000'>Sounds good.</font><br>
[Sat Nov 18 14:56:42 2006] : <B>(2) Alan</B>: <font color='#000000'>Matt can attest.</font><br>
[Sat Nov 18 14:56:58 2006] : <B>(3) Rien</B>: <font color='#004000'>Okay.  I don't drink, beer or otherwise, so I won't seek to recommend other brands.</font><br>
