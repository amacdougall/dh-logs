[Sat Sep  4 18:14:03 2010] : <b>(1881) Rien</b>: <font color='#263607'>We are sans Matt today, are we not?</font><br />
[Sat Sep  4 18:14:11 2010] : <b>(1882) Renate</b>: <font color='#000080'>I believe that's correct.</font><br />
[Sat Sep  4 18:15:52 2010] : <b>(1880) Alan</b>: <font color='#3d0079'>Hey. I got my coffee in advance this time!</font><br />
[Sat Sep  4 18:16:08 2010] : <b>(1881) Rien</b>: <font color='#263607'>Huzzah!</font><br />
[Sat Sep  4 18:18:58 2010] : <b>(1880) Alan</b>: <font color='#3d0079'>So yeah. Watching extremely knowledgeable people watch and analyze Starcraft 2 is probably more fun than playing it myself. I coulda saved myself $60! What's up with you guys?</font><br />
[Sat Sep  4 18:19:37 2010] : <b>(1882) Renate</b>: <font color='#000080'>Did a little biking today and went to the Taste of Madison. </font><br />
[Sat Sep  4 18:19:43 2010] : <b>(1880) Alan</b>: <font color='#3d0079'>Also I'm making roasted vegetable stock, because a thing of celery literally the size of a dachsund was $1.50 and Pennsylvania potatoes were $1 a pound. So I might zip off to check on it from time to time.</font><br />
[Sat Sep  4 18:20:24 2010] : <b>(1881) Rien</b>: <font color='#263607'>Irony!  I have chicken stock on the boil, for chicken soup later today once stock cools enough for me to skim.</font><br />
[Sat Sep  4 18:20:31 2010] : <b>(1880) Alan</b>: <font color='#3d0079'>I keep thinking I should get a bike. Worst that could happen is I get run over by a bus.</font><br />
[Sat Sep  4 18:20:44 2010] : <b>(1880) Alan</b>: <font color='#3d0079'>That's not irony, just coincidence.</font><br />

[Sat Sep  4 18:21:14 2010] : <b>(1880) Alan</b>: <font color='#3d0079'>I was exaggerating a little, honestly. There are bike lanes and municipal bike racks all over.</font><br />
[Sat Sep  4 18:21:34 2010] : <b>(1880) Alan</b>: <font color='#3d0079'>And in answer to your blog, NYC also closes down entire six-lane one-way avenues for bike traffic on some weekends.</font><br />
[Sat Sep  4 18:21:44 2010] : <b>(1881) Rien</b>: <font color='#263607'>Why did I say irony?  I know it's not irony.</font><br />
[Sat Sep  4 18:21:56 2010] : <b>(1881) Rien</b>: <font color='#263607'>My brain, it has not been working well the last few days unless it's work.</font><br />
[Sat Sep  4 18:23:19 2010] : <b>(1880) Alan</b>: <font color='#3d0079'>So what do you guys want to do today? Press on to Brosford with Aryk in NPC mode, or backtrack and cover some fluff that would have happened earlier? I am pretty sure Rien had some people he wanted to talk to. For some definition of "people."</font><br />
[Sat Sep  4 18:24:17 2010] : <b>(1880) Alan</b>: <font color='#3d0079'>And Emily could use some advice on how to pursue her investigation; and Barbara Stefanhauer has some unsolicited advice for Renate on how to work with the Company.</font><br />
[Sat Sep  4 18:24:51 2010] : <b>(1881) Rien</b>: <font color='#263607'>Did we talk to people already?  Rien arranged for the sale of the dragon corpses, although he would like to see if he can find out more about Glitter in the area.</font><br />
[Sat Sep  4 18:24:52 2010] : <b>(1880) Alan</b>: <font color='#3d0079'>Could happen in the near future, but it could have happened between the Karlbotel caravan and the abortive war council.</font><br />
[Sat Sep  4 18:25:17 2010] : <b>(1882) Renate</b>: <font color='#000080'>Weren't you going to have a chat with the Grovekeeper?</font><br />
[Sat Sep  4 18:25:19 2010] : <b>(1880) Alan</b>: <font color='#3d0079'>If we backtrack and cover stuff that happened a few days before last session, we'll have Matt for the Brosford venture.</font><br />
[Sat Sep  4 18:25:48 2010] : <b>(1881) Rien</b>: <font color='#263607'>Oh yeah, but I can't remember what about.</font><br />
[Sat Sep  4 18:28:10 2010] : <b>(1882) Renate</b>: <font color='#000080'>Not being an amoral dickweed?</font><br />
[Sat Sep  4 18:28:37 2010] : <b>(1880) Alan</b>: <font color='#3d0079'>I don't think he'd like being called a weed!</font><br />
[Sat Sep  4 18:29:42 2010] : <b>(1882) Renate</b>: <font color='#000080'>As for Renate, she's wanted to go out into Kentfield and meet some folks, find out what's what.</font><br />
[Sat Sep  4 18:31:04 2010] : <b>(1880) Alan</b>: <font color='#3d0079'>Definitely a good idea. Obviously that's still important.</font><br />
[Sat Sep  4 18:31:17 2010] : <b>(1881) Rien</b>: <font color='#263607'>Alrighty, then.</font><br />
[Sat Sep  4 18:32:22 2010] : <b>(1881) Rien</b>: <font color='#263607'>So Rien can talk to the Grovekeeper, and be all "do you remember what it was like to be human?"</font><br />
[Sat Sep  4 18:32:32 2010] : <b>(1882) Renate</b>: <font color='#000080'>"Er, no, why?"</font><br />
[Sat Sep  4 18:33:13 2010] : <b>(1880) Alan</b>: <font color='#3d0079'>Yeah, the Grovekeeper's actual nature is still unclear as of yet, too. Maybe you'd find out something interesting there.</font><br />
[Sat Sep  4 18:34:09 2010] : <b>(1882) Renate</b>: <font color='#000080'>I'm in favor. Go for it, Rien.</font><br />
[Sat Sep  4 18:34:23 2010] : <b>(1882) Renate</b>: <font color='#000080'>(Also, we might want to take Adam with us.)</font><br />
[Sat Sep  4 18:34:39 2010] : <b>(1880) Alan</b>: <font color='#3d0079'>He wouldn't be opposed to that.</font><br />
[Sat Sep  4 18:35:22 2010] : <b>(1881) Rien</b>: <font color='#263607'>Okay</font><br />
[Sat Sep  4 18:35:24 2010] : <b>(1881) Rien</b>: <font color='#263607'>Let us do that, then.</font><br />
[Sat Sep  4 18:35:45 2010] : <b>(1880) Alan</b>: <font color='#3d0079'><hr /></font><br />
[Sat Sep  4 18:38:25 2010] : <b>(1880) Alan</b>: <font color='#3d0079'>Herrendon Deep has grown taller, it seems; though perhaps it's a trick of the terrain, as the approach through Carrackshire leads through a long sloping meadow lowland. As you climb toward the forest, the crowns of the massive oaks barely sway even in what is becoming quite a brisk wind.</font><br />
[Sat Sep  4 18:39:20 2010] : <b>(1880) Alan</b>: <font color='#3d0079'>It's getting close to the early autumn storm season, the farmers say as they hurry to finish a round of haying; soon the countryside will be blanketed in rain.</font><br />
[Sat Sep  4 18:41:37 2010] : <b>(1881) Rien</b>: <font color='#263607'>Rien stops on the way up to lend them a hand getting the last of the threshed hay into stacks ready for bailing.</font><br />
[Sat Sep  4 18:42:24 2010] : <b>(1880) Alan</b>: <font color='#3d0079'>Adam helps with that as well, displaying surprising endurance despite his lack of muscle.</font><br />
[Sat Sep  4 18:43:00 2010] : <font color='#008000'>** (1882) Renate <font color='#008000'>pitches in cheerfully also, remembering the rhythm of a pitchfork as though she'd never learned the rhythm of a sword.</font> **</font><br />
[Sat Sep  4 18:45:46 2010] : <b>(1880) Alan</b>: <font color='#3d0079'>Adam's familiarity with farm work is clearly next to nil, but he doesn't have to be prompted to pitch in, and he gets the hang of it quickly. Then again, all he's doing is lugging hay around in special wheelbarrows, which doesn't take much in the way of talent.</font><br />
[Sat Sep  4 18:47:21 2010] : <b>(1881) Rien</b>: <font color='#263607'>Once the stacks are stacked and the tarpaulins tarpaulined, Rien waves farewell and continues the hike up the hill.</font><br />
[Sat Sep  4 18:47:33 2010] : <b>(1880) Alan</b>: <font color='#3d0079'>"Looks bigger up close," Adam says an hour later, as you come within bowshot of the forest's edge.</font><br />
[Sat Sep  4 18:48:12 2010] : <b>(1882) Renate</b>: <font color='#000080'>"Most things do."</font><br />
[Sat Sep  4 18:48:36 2010] : <b>(1880) Alan</b>: <font color='#3d0079'>The forest is a part of the skyline even in Margolin, but hardly anyone goes there.</font><br />
[Sat Sep  4 18:49:15 2010] : <b>(1880) Alan</b>: <font color='#3d0079'>After all, if you aren't an established trader, the forest generally rejects you... or else you go in and don't return.</font><br />
[Sat Sep  4 18:51:38 2010] : <b>(1880) Alan</b>: <font color='#3d0079'>"It feels quieter the closer we get, but the effect is entirely mental. Strange. Is it an outside influence or just my apprehension?" Adam asks.</font><br />
[Sat Sep  4 18:51:58 2010] : <font color='#008000'>** (1882) Renate <font color='#008000'>lets Rien field that one.</font> **</font><br />
[Sat Sep  4 18:52:08 2010] : <b>(1881) Rien</b>: <font color='#263607'>"Yes."</font><br />
[Sat Sep  4 18:52:31 2010] : <b>(1880) Alan</b>: <font color='#3d0079'>He's right -- the whistling of the wind in the tall meadow grass is unchanged, and birdsong comes from the forest, but as you approach the enchanted area, things simply <i>feel</i> quieter.</font><br />
[Sat Sep  4 18:55:57 2010] : <b>(1880) Alan</b>: <font color='#3d0079'>"Well, further up and further in, I suppose," Adam says, and lightly taps his horse's neck with his reins. It resumes a brisk walk.</font><br />
[Sat Sep  4 18:57:18 2010] : <b>(1882) Renate</b>: <font color='#000080'>"Just be nice to the trees," Renate suggests.</font><br />
[Sat Sep  4 18:58:13 2010] : <b>(1881) Rien</b>: <font color='#263607'>Rien pulls out in front of the group as they enter past the easily defined border of the forest.  "Too bad we didn't bring more of those plants.  The Dryads love them."</font><br />

And that's when, wouldn't you know it, our houses and all the land they were on just sort of up and moved. Not like being pulled along in a cart, but more like being on a riverboat drifting along.

There's something my family's passed down through the generations, ever since an angel taught it to one of my ancestors. That is, that evil starts when you want something. Now, I know it's not evil just to want something, especially something you really need. But sometimes, you have everything you need, and you still want something. And if you get it, you want something else. I hope it isn't like that for you, my lord, but it sure is for me, and for most people I know."</font><br />

[Sat Sep  4 20:38:12 2010] : <b>(1880) Alan</b>: <font color='#3d0079'>"Depends on what you mean, my lord. Some people want to improve their, well, 'their lot' as they say. And so they farm more, or learn a new skill, and life is better for everyone. Every now and then, someone just wants more out of life than Birch Creek has got. Well, even before the Grovekeeper came, that happened. And people just left for bigger places. Nothing wrong with that. They still can, as far as I know. Hasn't happened in a few years though."</font><br />
