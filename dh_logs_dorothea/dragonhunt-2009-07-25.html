[Sat Jul 25 00:31:32 2009] : <b>(1460) Alan</b>: <font color='#000080'>Of course, politics leads to infighting, and so do romances; even harmless hobbies like poetry or music came to be the cause of fierce and sometimes violent factional disagreements, as the imprisoned elves came to attach outsized importance to everything in their tiny sphere.</font><br />
[Sat Jul 25 00:32:47 2009] : <b>(1460) Alan</b>: <font color='#000080'>Then, Tristan Laurent made a discovery.</font><br />
[Sat Jul 25 00:34:01 2009] : <b>(1460) Alan</b>: <font color='#000080'>One million miles away, in the direction which was once northeast when Uverlin floated over the sunlit world, there was a presence.</font><br />
[Sat Jul 25 00:34:34 2009] : <b>(1460) Alan</b>: <font color='#000080'>An energy, a mass; that was all he was able to detect.</font><br />
[Sat Jul 25 00:35:26 2009] : <b>(1460) Alan</b>: <font color='#000080'>It gave off no light, obviously; and so, with no light at all except the dim light of elven glowbulbs, there was no way to detect it other than certain subtle tests of the ether.</font><br />
[Sat Jul 25 00:35:45 2009] : <b>(1460) Alan</b>: <font color='#000080'>Tristan had deduced its presence and distance, and that was all; of its nature, he could not surmise.</font><br />
[Sat Jul 25 00:37:12 2009] : <b>(1460) Alan</b>: <font color='#000080'>A few years later, a breakthrough: he had come no closer to figuring out its nature, but it was coming closer, at the astounding clip of nine miles each day.</font><br />
[Sat Jul 25 00:37:31 2009] : <b>(1460) Alan</b>: <font color='#000080'>At that rate, it would reach Uverlin in three hundred years.</font><br />
[Sat Jul 25 00:40:29 2009] : <b>(1460) Alan</b>: <font color='#000080'>Fifty years later, he was able to estimate the entity's size and even shape: it was a sphere, nearly 90,000 miles wide -- the diameter of Tarentan, one of the gas-giant outer planets.</font><br />
[Sat Jul 25 00:41:34 2009] : <b>(1460) Alan</b>: <font color='#000080'>A hundred years later than that, he was able to get a reading on its chemical makeup: it was made mostly of carbon, in complex compounds, with strong admixtures of hydrogen and oxygen in amounts matching those of normal water.</font><br />
[Sat Jul 25 00:42:12 2009] : <b>(1460) Alan</b>: <font color='#000080'>Of course, the more excitable and scientifically knowledgeable elves immediately asked: is this a <i>creature</i>?</font><br />
[Sat Jul 25 00:43:19 2009] : <b>(1460) Alan</b>: <font color='#000080'>Of course not, Laurent replied. The body emitted no heat or energy of any kind; showed no movement other than its slow drift toward Uverlin. Of course, it was well worth asking what if perhaps they should move the fortress... <i>out of the damn way</i>.</font><br />
[Sat Jul 25 00:44:05 2009] : <b>(1460) Alan</b>: <font color='#000080'>There was a resistance to this idea: the fortress was resting on a planar nexus which was its only possible route back to the real world.</font><br />
[Sat Jul 25 00:44:33 2009] : <b>(1460) Alan</b>: <font color='#000080'>The elves, all of them, had been holding on to the hope that maybe one day the dragons would be defeated, and they would get word that it was safe to return.</font><br />
[Sat Jul 25 00:44:49 2009] : <b>(1460) Alan</b>: <font color='#000080'>Not a realistic hope, perhaps; but the only hope they had.</font><br />
[Sat Jul 25 00:45:35 2009] : <b>(1460) Alan</b>: <font color='#000080'>A hundred years later, the entity was close enough for Laurent to bounce active signals off of, to try to figure out its composition, its surface topography.</font><br />
[Sat Jul 25 00:47:32 2009] : <b>(1460) Alan</b>: <font color='#000080'>but he learned little; his imaging was still fuzzy, and learned only that the entity's surface was solid, not gaseous like all known planets of that size; not as dense as rock, but denser than water; and covered with mountains of astounding height, in defiance of all that was known of gravity.</font><br />
[Sat Jul 25 00:48:08 2009] : <b>(1460) Alan</b>: <font color='#000080'>Eventually, there was no choice but to move the fortress. Great engines were put into use for the first time in four hundred fifty years.</font><br />
[Sat Jul 25 00:48:32 2009] : <b>(1460) Alan</b>: <font color='#000080'>And the moment the fortress shifted by even an inch, there was a tremendous shock, and it stopped again.</font><br />
[Sat Jul 25 00:49:46 2009] : <b>(1460) Alan</b>: <font color='#000080'>In an eyeblink, black tentacles harder than stone had stretched across 150,000 miles of space and rooted themselves in the Overland's firmament, locking it in place.</font><br />
[Sat Jul 25 00:50:59 2009] : <b>(1460) Alan</b>: <font color='#000080'>For twenty years, Laurent and his mages -- and the rest of the population, everyone who could help at all -- studied the tentacles, now as immobile as rock formations, trying to learn their secret, find their weakness.</font><br />
[Sat Jul 25 00:52:10 2009] : <b>(1460) Alan</b>: <font color='#000080'>They were like flesh, but rock-hard and immune to all his magic; they absorbed energy like a black body; they could take every beating the elves tried to deliver.</font><br />
[Sat Jul 25 00:52:40 2009] : <b>(1460) Alan</b>: <font color='#000080'>And the vast sphere, of that same fleshlike substance, covered with swaying tentacles the size of mountains, drew ever nearer.</font><br />
[Sat Jul 25 00:53:04 2009] : <b>(1460) Alan</b>: <font color='#000080'>Ten years ago -- forty years ago in real-world time -- something changed.</font><br />
[Sat Jul 25 00:53:45 2009] : <b>(1460) Alan</b>: <font color='#000080'>A long thin line of green light appeared, almost perfectly straight, slashing on a diagonal across the "northeastern" sky of Uverlin.</font><br />
[Sat Jul 25 00:54:13 2009] : <b>(1460) Alan</b>: <font color='#000080'>It stayed that way for another few days; a streak of light across the surface of the dark body.</font><br />
[Sat Jul 25 00:56:08 2009] : <b>(1460) Alan</b>: <font color='#000080'>Then the eye opened, sixty thousand miles wide and thirty thousand miles tall, brilliant multihued green in blurry fractal patterns, except for empty black pupils each wide enough to fit the entire earth in.</font><br />
[Sat Jul 25 00:56:26 2009] : <b>(1460) Alan</b>: <font color='#000080'>The elves waited to die.</font><br />
[Sat Jul 25 00:57:02 2009] : <b>(1460) Alan</b>: <font color='#000080'>The journals end there; or earlier. Suicides claimed more than half the fortress after the eye opened.</font><br />
