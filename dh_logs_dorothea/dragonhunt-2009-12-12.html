[Sat Dec 12 08:49:15 2009] : <b>(1116) Alan</b>: <font color='#000080'>Okay, we know for sure that Rien can always find his way through the Spirit World to a planar nexus.</font><br />
[Sat Dec 12 08:49:31 2009] : <b>(1116) Alan</b>: <font color='#000080'>We know that a planar nexus can lead from the physical world to a specific spot in the outer planes, and back.</font><br />
[Sat Dec 12 08:49:57 2009] : <b>(1116) Alan</b>: <font color='#000080'>We know that there are nexuses in the Spirit World (part of the Astral Plane, which interconnects all planes) which lead to specific higher planes.</font><br />
[Sat Dec 12 08:50:41 2009] : <b>(1116) Alan</b>: <font color='#000080'>It seems like I've set up a "nexus" as meaning a sort of focused pathway in the otherwise vague and risky astral travel.</font><br />
[Sat Dec 12 08:50:56 2009] : <b>(1116) Alan</b>: <font color='#000080'>But they've always been natural phenomena. Consistent so far?</font><br />
[Sat Dec 12 08:51:46 2009] : <b>(1116) Alan</b>: <font color='#000080'>So I'm gonna say that there's been research into creating temporary nexuses, for instance, to guide astral travelers to a certain spot.</font><br />
[Sat Dec 12 08:52:00 2009] : <b>(1114) Reyes</b>: <font color='#000080'>But it ain't exactly safe, am I hearing this right? :)</font><br />
[Sat Dec 12 08:52:15 2009] : <b>(1116) Alan</b>: <font color='#000080'>This has obvious uses, but not as many as you'd think -- true astral travel is rare compared to short-range point to point "dimension door" type portals.</font><br />
[Sat Dec 12 08:53:01 2009] : <b>(1116) Alan</b>: <font color='#000080'>There's a ton of research into gating soldiers across a distance of a few kilometers; not so much into helping powerful plane wanderers hit an exact patch of floor.</font><br />
[Sat Dec 12 08:53:25 2009] : <b>(1116) Alan</b>: <font color='#000080'>However, since it's relevant to Rien's powers, I'd say he's kept up with the scholarly literature whenever he had a chance, which is not often.</font><br />
[Sat Dec 12 08:54:03 2009] : <b>(1114) Reyes</b>: <font color='#000080'>I'll happily settle for "gets dumped into the drink within hailing distance of the boat" *g*</font><br />
[Sat Dec 12 08:54:16 2009] : <b>(1114) Reyes</b>: <font color='#000080'>Though Aryk and Rien will have to keep Renate afloat because she doesn't swim well.</font><br />
[Sat Dec 12 08:54:45 2009] : <b>(1116) Alan</b>: <font color='#000080'>We could agree that he has learned to bind a nexus into a physical object (which you could send on a boat) <i>if</i> we also agree that another area of study suffers (i.e. doesn't get an upgrade in the near future, which would otherwise have happened).</font><br />
[Sat Dec 12 08:54:58 2009] : <b>(1118) Aryk</b>: <font color='#710000'>Heh, neither does Aryk.  </font><br />
[Sat Dec 12 08:55:38 2009] : <b>(1116) Alan</b>: <font color='#000080'>It might be a useful new power. Not sure how often it would come up, but I can imagine plenty of uses for it.</font><br />
[Sat Dec 12 08:55:52 2009] : <b>(1116) Alan</b>: <font color='#000080'>Get a physical object to a location; Rien and co. plane-travel right to it.</font><br />
[Sat Dec 12 08:56:04 2009] : <b>(1118) Aryk</b>: <font color='#710000'>That's what I was thinking.</font><br />

[Sat Dec 12 08:56:58 2009] : <b>(1116) Alan</b>: <font color='#000080'>There'll be another round of upgrades around the end of this chapter, so if you want this power, it would be your upgrade.</font><br />
[Sat Dec 12 08:57:44 2009] : <b>(1114) Reyes</b>: <font color='#000080'>(It's sort of the reverse of what Aryk does with his sword. Not uncool.)</font><br />
[Sat Dec 12 08:58:06 2009] : <b>(1116) Alan</b>: <font color='#000080'>I'm thinking that the duration of the nexus binding would be based on the materials used and the time and power spent. Make a fancy gold jeweled magic item thing over the course of a week, it could stay bound for months or years. Nexus bind a tin spring, you've got half a day.</font><br />
[Sat Dec 12 08:58:49 2009] : <b>(1114) Reyes</b>: <font color='#000080'>that seems fair</font><br />
[Sat Dec 12 08:58:50 2009] : <b>(1117) Niks Xejn</b>: <font color='#400040'>Hmm.  I'd honestly prefer if Rien could read the spriti world around him to tell where, subjectively, they are, so he could just drop out in a general area.  </font><br />
[Sat Dec 12 08:58:50 2009] : <b>(1116) Alan</b>: <font color='#000080'>Each time you zero in on the nexus, the binding enchantment loses some of its power. Cheap items bound in haste would be one-shots.</font><br />
[Sat Dec 12 08:58:51 2009] : <b>(1118) Aryk</b>: <font color='#710000'>True.  If Rien wants to practice with Aryk to see how he does his sword trick, he could improve upon it.</font><br />
[Sat Dec 12 08:59:10 2009] : <b>(1116) Alan</b>: <font color='#000080'>Binding enchantments don't interact well, so you have to keep them physically separated.</font><br />
[Sat Dec 12 08:59:11 2009] : <b>(1118) Aryk</b>: <font color='#710000'>And maybe Aryk's upgrade would be the same thing.  Throw the sword, teleport to it.</font><br />
[Sat Dec 12 08:59:39 2009] : <b>(1117) Niks Xejn</b>: <font color='#400040'>What does Aryk do with his sword?</font><br />
[Sat Dec 12 08:59:40 2009] : <b>(1116) Alan</b>: <font color='#000080'>Well, the holy sword summon wouldn't teach Rien much; divine magic is different. Basically "ask an angel to do it."</font><br />
[Sat Dec 12 08:59:49 2009] : <b>(1118) Aryk</b>: <font color='#710000'>Yeah.</font><br />
[Sat Dec 12 09:00:10 2009] : <b>(1116) Alan</b>: <font color='#000080'>Well, you can take a shot at the general-area thing. The Spirit World is tricky, though, even flying low.</font><br />
[Sat Dec 12 09:00:30 2009] : <b>(1116) Alan</b>: <font color='#000080'>You probably can't find a boat on the sea, since it's such a transient thing.</font><br />
[Sat Dec 12 09:00:45 2009] : <b>(1116) Alan</b>: <font color='#000080'>It won't make any mark on the Mirror Realm, much less the Spirit World.</font><br />
[Sat Dec 12 09:00:58 2009] : <b>(1117) Niks Xejn</b>: <font color='#400040'>How about creating a beacon instead of a nexus?</font><br />
[Sat Dec 12 09:01:40 2009] : <b>(1116) Alan</b>: <font color='#000080'>If there's active magic on board the ship, you'd be able to see the auras floating along (in the Mirror Realm).</font><br />
[Sat Dec 12 09:02:28 2009] : <b>(1116) Alan</b>: <font color='#000080'>A powerful source of magic would act as a beacon in the Mirror Realm, but in the Mirror Realm, gravity works. You'd go sploosh there too (but at least you wouldn't be visible until you caught up with the beacon).</font><br />

[Sat Dec 12 09:51:02 2009] : <b>(1117) Niks Xejn</b>: <font color='#400040'>And after this he is definitely going to comission some rechargable pieces.</font><br />
[Sat Dec 12 09:51:11 2009] : <b>(1117) Niks Xejn</b>: <font color='#400040'>(assuming he can afford them)</font><br />
[Sat Dec 12 09:51:20 2009] : <b>(1116) Alan</b>: <font color='#000080'>Now, that pearl is an interesting exception -- Rien will find it indestructible and fast-charging. It seems to have become structured to accept magical energy, down at the level of the crystalline matrices of gem and setting.</font><br />
[Sat Dec 12 09:52:38 2009] : <b>(1114) Reyes</b>: <font color='#000080'>(I owe Lyria, don't I? *g*)</font><br />
[Sat Dec 12 09:52:50 2009] : <b>(1116) Alan</b>: <font color='#000080'>This is something that was going to come up later, but... Rien strongly suspects some extremely weak but long-running magical force has been slowly reshaping the pearl into a magic item. Lyria whispers, <i>Aww, it was going to be a surprise.</i></font><br />
[Sat Dec 12 09:53:13 2009] : <b>(1114) Reyes</b>: <font color='#000080'><i>It is!</i> is Renate's fervent response.</font><br />
[Sat Dec 12 09:53:33 2009] : <b>(1116) Alan</b>: <font color='#000080'><i>You do your magic; I'll put mine in when you're done.</i></font><br />
[Sat Dec 12 09:53:39 2009] : <b>(1117) Niks Xejn</b>: <font color='#400040'>Hmm... well, Rien will make use of that, then, if he can, but if he creates multiple devices to throw confusion into the mix for any would-be trackers, that pearl is going to stand out like a sore thumb.</font><br />
[Sat Dec 12 09:53:50 2009] : <b>(1114) Reyes</b>: <font color='#000080'><i>I think Mia might have liked it, too. Thank you, Lady, for this as for everything.</i></font><br />

[Sat Dec 12 09:54:42 2009] : <b>(1116) Alan</b>: <font color='#000080'>You can charge up six half-day nexus bindings in three hours, on random metal or glass objects.</font><br />
[Sat Dec 12 09:55:46 2009] : <b>(1116) Alan</b>: <font color='#000080'>Any material that has a highly regular internal molecular structure. I understand that glass isn't a crystal, it's almost a liquid, but Rien can work with that: part of the binding involves forcibly aligning the molecules into a certain pattern.</font><br />
[Sat Dec 12 09:55:53 2009] : <b>(1116) Alan</b>: <font color='#000080'>Or in the case of the pearl, they already are.</font><br />
[Sat Dec 12 09:56:18 2009] : <b>(1116) Alan</b>: <font color='#000080'>I don't want to have to bullshit too much about magic item creation, you know? But you have to do "something" to the material so it can hold a charge.</font><br />
[Sat Dec 12 09:56:20 2009] : <b>(1117) Niks Xejn</b>: <font color='#400040'>Okay, sure.  Let's do that.  Five items, let's call it.  Leaving us time to meet our contact.  Unless the others are going without Rien.</font><br />
[Sat Dec 12 09:56:29 2009] : <b>(1114) Reyes</b>: <font color='#000080'>no, we're NOT separating</font><br />
[Sat Dec 12 09:56:33 2009] : <b>(1114) Reyes</b>: <font color='#000080'>that's LoCaine bait, that is</font><br />
[Sat Dec 12 09:56:40 2009] : <b>(1116) Alan</b>: <font color='#000080'>If you use a poor material, and don't have much time, it holds a charge worse. Easy as that.</font><br />
[Sat Dec 12 09:57:18 2009] : <b>(1116) Alan</b>: <font color='#000080'>Permanent magic items take forever to make because they use the best materials and get transformed with utmost meticulousness. Now you know... the rest of the story.</font><br />
[Sat Dec 12 09:57:43 2009] : <b>(1117) Niks Xejn</b>: <font color='#400040'>(Where have I heard that before?)</font><br />
[Sat Dec 12 09:57:59 2009] : <b>(1116) Alan</b>: <font color='#000080'>Student Artificers practice by making inferior magic items that just wear out after a bit. Like, Ring of Protection +0.25, lasts four days.</font><br />

[Sat Dec 12 09:59:21 2009] : <b>(1116) Alan</b>: <font color='#000080'>How are you sending out the decoys, by the way?</font><br />

[Sat Dec 12 10:00:43 2009] : <b>(1114) Reyes</b>: <font color='#000080'>yes, I think this is a McKinnon problem.</font><br />
[Sat Dec 12 10:00:54 2009] : <b>(1118) Aryk</b>: <font color='#710000'>One of us can just go to the docks and throw some coin at a few different captains.  Say, "here, I'll pay you to take this.  After several hours, throw it in the sea for all I care."</font><br />

[Sat Dec 12 10:01:27 2009] : <b>(1114) Reyes</b>: <font color='#000080'>no, that's begging for questions</font><br />
[Sat Dec 12 10:01:33 2009] : <b>(1116) Alan</b>: <font color='#000080'>All right; you know you can send him a message through the concierge. McKinnon has given you to understand that the man is trustworthy, as long as he has no temptation. Sealed boring envelopes are fine.</font><br />
[Sat Dec 12 10:01:39 2009] : <b>(1114) Reyes</b>: <font color='#000080'>treat it like any ordinary parcel -- deliver it to a dead drop or something</font><br />
[Sat Dec 12 10:02:01 2009] : <b>(1114) Reyes</b>: <font color='#000080'>no worries, then</font><br />
[Sat Dec 12 10:03:55 2009] : <b>(1116) Alan</b>: <font color='#000080'>Okay, so four of them are just going out in random directions as certified mail?</font><br />
[Sat Dec 12 10:04:02 2009] : <b>(1117) Niks Xejn</b>: <font color='#400040'>Sealed boring envelopes would be tempting to me!  If I knew they were being sent on matters of intrigue I would find it... intriguing.</font><br />
[Sat Dec 12 10:04:17 2009] : <b>(1114) Reyes</b>: <font color='#000080'>yes, Alan</font><br />
[Sat Dec 12 10:04:32 2009] : <b>(1117) Niks Xejn</b>: <font color='#400040'>No, general knowledge says that the target is at sea, which means that the packages have to go to sea or they'll be ignored.</font><br />
[Sat Dec 12 10:05:47 2009] : <b>(1116) Alan</b>: <font color='#000080'>this is assuming LoCaine and/or Skvarce know they're magic, and what the magic is for -- which would require them to either intercept and study one, or make an intuitive leap. Neither is unlikely, though.</font><br />
[Sat Dec 12 10:05:59 2009] : <b>(1116) Alan</b>: <font color='#000080'>These are both very intelligent and resourceful adversaries.</font><br />

[Sat Dec 12 10:08:07 2009] : <b>(1116) Alan</b>: <font color='#000080'>Okay, so we'll assume McKinnon can get them sent in likely-looking directions. You don't hear back from him -- feedback loops are soooo traceable -- but I'll tell you he sends two south along the coast immediately, one on a freighter back to Atlantis, one north, and one inland toward volcano country.</font><br />
[Sat Dec 12 10:08:23 2009] : <b>(1116) Alan</b>: <font color='#000080'>Which might especially freak out Skvarce, if he knows enough.</font><br />

[Sat Dec 12 10:10:52 2009] : <b>(1116) Alan</b>: <font color='#000080'>If Rien had stayed in the Andragarian loop, he'd know this. :) It's a secret, but not a <i>big</i> secret, so we'll say one of his planar contacts told him: Dark Eternal sought out and invaded Uverlin all on his own.</font><br />
[Sat Dec 12 10:11:32 2009] : <b>(1116) Alan</b>: <font color='#000080'>Who knows when Hell found out -- though it's certain they do. When Heaven found out, Lachlan Vinn asked questions just barely loud enough for ears outside Shadow Square to hear them.</font><br />
[Sat Dec 12 10:11:42 2009] : <b>(1116) Alan</b>: <font color='#000080'>Which means he probably wanted to be just barely heard.</font><br />
