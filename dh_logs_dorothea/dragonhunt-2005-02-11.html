[Fri Feb 11 21:24:25 2005] : <B>Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>The Chaosium contains, as stated, seventy-seven summoning rituals; the summoning for Absalom is the first one in a subsection entitled 'Unconfirmed/Spurious.'"</font><br>
[Fri Feb 11 21:25:15 2005] : <B>Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>Your spirits quickly build a cross-reference table for the Compendium, but turn up nothing else relating to Absalom.</font><br>
[Fri Feb 11 21:25:51 2005] : <B>Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>A larger search on Absalom finds him mentioned largely as a philosophical principle, a sort of Panurge common to many systems of metaphysics; hardly ever is Absalom considered a summonable entity.</font><br>
[Fri Feb 11 21:25:59 2005] : <B>Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>Or indeed an entity in any sense of having a consciousness.</font><br>
[Fri Feb 11 21:26:08 2005] : <B>Tancred</B>: <font color='#000080'>Turn it around. Where is Absalom reputed to dwell?</font><br>
[Fri Feb 11 21:26:19 2005] : <B>Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>If the Mother, the vast swirling Chaos of the Chaos Plane, is a female principle, Absalom is considered the male principle of Chaos.</font><br>
[Fri Feb 11 21:26:42 2005] : <B>Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>To the extent that Absalom is said to dwell anywhere, he is coterminous with but separate from the Mother.</font><br>
[Fri Feb 11 21:26:54 2005] : <B>Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>That is, he is all of Chaos, and depending on your point of view, all of Creation.</font><br>
[Fri Feb 11 21:27:27 2005] : <B>Tancred</B>: <font color='#000080'>Great. So they summoned the unsummonable, or they summoned something else without knowing they were doing it.</font><br>
[Fri Feb 11 21:27:41 2005] : <B>Tancred</B>: <font color='#000080'>If the latter, then Lucrecia could be -- anywhere.</font><br>
[Fri Feb 11 21:28:06 2005] : <B>Tancred</B>: <font color='#000080'>He scans the table again, for seeking or clairvoyance spells into Chaos.</font><br>
[Fri Feb 11 21:28:17 2005] : <B>Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>Those few texts that consider him summonable still consider him to have only <i>ad hoc</i> localized presence.</font><br>
[Fri Feb 11 21:29:00 2005] : <B>Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>Unlike, say, Whirlwind Lionheart, who always has a single point at which his consciousness resides, Absalom is said to be more like the (possibly imaginary) True King or Great Lord: a discrete entity, but one who exists "in all things."</font><br>
[Fri Feb 11 21:29:29 2005] : <B>Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>There are thousands of occult and arcane spells that allow one to view the Chaos Plane; none focus on Absalom specifically.</font><br>
[Fri Feb 11 21:29:59 2005] : <B>Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>If he exists in a single place, using a general Chaos-scryer would be like finding the needle; if he exists in all Chaos, he's the haystack.</font><br>
[Fri Feb 11 21:30:05 2005] : <B>Tancred</B>: <font color='#000080'>Do any of them allow focusing on a specific mortal?</font><br>
[Fri Feb 11 21:30:17 2005] : <B>Tancred</B>: <font color='#000080'>Without actually knowing where she is, except that she is somewhere in Chaos?</font><br>
[Fri Feb 11 21:30:45 2005] : <B>Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>Yes, but they all specify that each Chaos Power can establish a "realm" that is shielded from any scrying that originates from the Human World.</font><br>
[Fri Feb 11 21:30:59 2005] : <B>Tancred</B>: <font color='#000080'>Even Absalom?</font><br>
[Fri Feb 11 21:31:05 2005] : <B>Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>If you base your scrying in the Chaos Plane, you might have a chance... if your patron or other source of power is strong enough.</font><br>
[Fri Feb 11 21:31:08 2005] : <B>Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>No, it's a general case.</font><br>
[Fri Feb 11 21:31:20 2005] : <B>Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>It's extremely safe to assume that anything other Chaos Lords can do, Absalom can, though.</font><br>
[Fri Feb 11 21:31:35 2005] : <B>Tancred</B>: <font color='#000080'>Eh, well. Sometimes exceptions prove interesting.</font><br>
[Fri Feb 11 21:31:40 2005] : <B>Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>Once you postulate him as a Chaos Power in the first place.</font><br>
