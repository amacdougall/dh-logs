[Sat Jun 28 09:05:33 2008] : <b>(10618) Renate</b>: <font color='#000080'>Apparently not, per Adrian.</font><br />

[Sat Jun 28 09:05:49 2008] : <b>(10618) Renate</b>: <font color='#000080'>So we can Tancred/Sashi or we can deal with Renate's big decision, whatever TF that turns out to be.</font><br />

[Sat Jun 28 09:08:38 2008] : <b>(10618) Renate</b>: <font color='#000080'>Good question. :) I think we'll have our girl stop in on whatever serves Ilium for local Lyria worship.</font><br />

[Sat Jun 28 09:08:49 2008] : <b>(10617) Alan</b>: <font color='#000080'>At its core it's Renate's own decision; but she's apt to reach it after consulting with trusted parties and getting info.</font><br />

[Sat Jun 28 09:10:29 2008] : <b>(10617) Alan</b>: <font color='#000080'>Probably the first actually, since without anyone nearby looking at the kitchen, and without a memorized layout, she's going to get cut or burned.</font><br />
[Sat Jun 28 09:10:35 2008] : <b>(10617) Alan</b>: <font color='#000080'>Or just cook veeeery slowly.</font><br />
[Sat Jun 28 09:10:38 2008] : <b>(10618) Renate</b>: <font color='#000080'>Ren's a terrible cook and always was.</font><br />
[Sat Jun 28 09:10:53 2008] : <b>(10618) Renate</b>: <font color='#000080'>If there's no one around to do it for her, she sticks to pastries and jam and the like.</font><br />
[Sat Jun 28 09:11:25 2008] : <b>(10617) Alan</b>: <font color='#000080'>We can assume Sabine was the one who took to the homemaker tasks, though of course they were considered fundamentals for later running a manor/castle kitchen.</font><br />
[Sat Jun 28 09:11:33 2008] : <b>(10617) Alan</b>: <font color='#000080'>As somebody's alliance wife.</font><br />

[Sat Jun 28 09:12:58 2008] : <b>(10618) Renate</b>: <font color='#000080'>I suspect Emil also slaughtered. Gotta be done.</font><br />
[Sat Jun 28 09:13:04 2008] : <b>(10618) Renate</b>: <font color='#000080'>And if he didn't, Renate sure did.</font><br />
[Sat Jun 28 09:13:32 2008] : <b>(10617) Alan</b>: <font color='#000080'>Well, after hunting, you butcher your own catch -- no huntmasters in Karlbotel, just riding buddies.</font><br />
[Sat Jun 28 09:13:57 2008] : <b>(10617) Alan</b>: <font color='#000080'>Meat came into the manor in the form of fresh carcasses, though -- amortized tax.</font><br />
[Sat Jun 28 09:14:01 2008] : <b>(10617) Alan</b>: <font color='#000080'>Anyway.</font><br />
[Sat Jun 28 09:14:05 2008] : <b>(10617) Alan</b>: <font color='#000080'>Lyria doesn't insist on temples, though she doesn't mind them in the least.</font><br />
[Sat Jun 28 09:14:36 2008] : <b>(10617) Alan</b>: <font color='#000080'>What happened to the Jenner house again?</font><br />
[Sat Jun 28 09:14:50 2008] : <b>(10618) Renate</b>: <font color='#000080'>I think it's a community center. Talos bought it.</font><br />
[Sat Jun 28 09:16:05 2008] : <b>(10617) Alan</b>: <font color='#000080'>Ah, quite right. Well, recognizing common cause and a debt to Renate, he's shared it with some Lyria folks, as I probably would have said earlier. Most of Lyria's good works take place -- not to be trite -- in people's hearts, though.</font><br />
[Sat Jun 28 09:16:34 2008] : <b>(10618) Renate</b>: <font color='#000080'>To be sure. But mutual support and the occasional gathering are always nice.</font><br />
[Sat Jun 28 09:17:33 2008] : <b>(10617) Alan</b>: <font color='#000080'>So the main use Lyria's side gets out of the building is to organize parties of idealistic youths to go out into the Patchwork Kingdoms and dig irrigation, or reclaim cropland from weeds.</font><br />
[Sat Jun 28 09:17:59 2008] : <b>(10617) Alan</b>: <font color='#000080'>There are lots of depressed areas in the Patchworks with perfectly arable land that just isn't used because the local subsistence farmers have their hands full just staying fed.</font><br />

[Sat Jun 28 09:20:14 2008] : <b>(10618) Renate</b>: <font color='#000080'>Plenty to do in Ilium itself as well.</font><br />
[Sat Jun 28 09:21:02 2008] : <b>(10617) Alan</b>: <font color='#000080'>The closest thing Lyria has to a spiritual leader in Ilium is a woman called "Kate Always" -- who is supposedly also Laura sometimes.</font><br />
[Sat Jun 28 09:21:17 2008] : <b>(10617) Alan</b>: <font color='#000080'>This appears to be a well-worn joke, because it's delivered with a straight face when Renate asks around.</font><br />

[Sat Jun 28 09:21:59 2008] : <b>(10617) Alan</b>: <font color='#000080'>She's to be found most days running the Third Street Cafe, which is actually on Fifth, having moved shop a few years back.</font><br />

[Sat Jun 28 09:23:56 2008] : <b>(10618) Renate</b>: <font color='#000080'>She thanks her informants and makes her way to Fifth Street, cane tapping.</font><br />

[Sat Jun 28 09:28:25 2008] : <b>(10617) Alan</b>: <font color='#000080'>The Third Street Cafe is not terribly much; just a storefront a few cartlengths long, with a few rustic wooden tables and chairs inside, a few worn benches outside, a blade sign that says "CAFE", and a soundcube playing high and lonesome close harmony over a country banjo.</font><br />

[Sat Jun 28 09:29:23 2008] : <b>(10617) Alan</b>: <font color='#000080'>Renate can catch the general details, including the sign, from passersby, but it would take Rien to notice that the door, which hangs open, still has the old address written on it.</font><br />
[Sat Jun 28 09:29:51 2008] : <b>(10617) Alan</b>: <font color='#000080'>Perhaps it was moved along with the cafe; or perhaps the old address was written on the new door ironically.</font><br />

[Sat Jun 28 11:49:35 2008] : <b>(10616) Rien</b>: <font color='#003300'>Hmm?</font><br />
[Sat Jun 28 11:49:50 2008] : <b>(10617) Alan</b>: <font color='#000080'>Turns out, if you open SQL*Plus, Oracle's command line, and do commands, you'll see your commands reflected in later queries.</font><br />
[Sat Jun 28 11:50:06 2008] : <b>(10617) Alan</b>: <font color='#000080'>But it's actually all shell-local. They only actually commit as a transaction once you exit SQL*Plus.</font><br />
[Sat Jun 28 11:50:22 2008] : <b>(10617) Alan</b>: <font color='#000080'>This is GOOD, it's awesome in fact -- you can screw around all you want, and then roll back or commit at your option.</font><br />
[Sat Jun 28 11:50:27 2008] : <b>(10616) Rien</b>: <font color='#003300'>You can't use abort/commit?</font><br />
[Sat Jun 28 11:50:46 2008] : <b>(10617) Alan</b>: <font color='#000080'>But I didn't know this... I had SQL*Plus as one screen in, well, screen. The application.</font><br />
[Sat Jun 28 11:51:04 2008] : <b>(10617) Alan</b>: <font color='#000080'>I just kept attaching and detaching from the screen session without exiting SQL*Plus or manually committing...</font><br />
[Sat Jun 28 11:51:07 2008] : <b>(10616) Rien</b>: <font color='#003300'>(I suppose opening a transaction before I run any query that will alter the database is habit not)</font><br />
[Sat Jun 28 11:51:10 2008] : <b>(10617) Alan</b>: <font color='#000080'>...then wondering why my changes never showed up!</font><br />
[Sat Jun 28 11:51:20 2008] : <b>(10616) Rien</b>: <font color='#003300'>Heh... that'll do it, sure.</font><br />
[Sat Jun 28 11:51:30 2008] : <b>(10617) Alan</b>: <font color='#000080'>Well, I was actually just running a script provided by a contractor.</font><br />
[Sat Jun 28 11:51:43 2008] : <b>(10617) Alan</b>: <font color='#000080'>So I didn't think it was necessary to open an explicit transaction.</font><br />
[Sat Jun 28 11:52:04 2008] : <b>(10617) Alan</b>: <font color='#000080'>Particularly since the scripts drop and regenerate the relevant tables, meaning no worries about state.</font><br />
[Sat Jun 28 11:52:13 2008] : <b>(10617) Alan</b>: <font color='#000080'>(As long as the whole script is atomic.)</font><br />
[Sat Jun 28 11:53:38 2008] : <b>(10617) Alan</b>: <font color='#000080'>All right, I'm 3000.</font><br />
