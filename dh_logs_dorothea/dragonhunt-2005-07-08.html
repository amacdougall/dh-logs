[Fri Jul 08 21:00:28 2005] : <B>Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>They've already discovered that nobody disappears from Veller's place if there's a stakeout, no matter how subtle.</font><br>
[Fri Jul 08 21:00:51 2005] : <B>Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>So this time, they'd give Rien a magical trinket that acts as a tracking device. Try to turn a blind eye to the actual extraction, then pick him up later.</font><br>
[Fri Jul 08 21:01:11 2005] : <B>Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>Without cooperation from Sabra's folks, Renate won't touch this. Too risky for Rien, who's being hunted.</font><br>

[Fri Jul 08 21:01:29 2005] : <B>Rien</B>: <font color='#004040'>Rien has said trinket</font><br>
[Fri Jul 08 21:02:06 2005] : <B>Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>The device was created by the Artificer's Guild to avoid magical detection; only the Guild (or some equivalent independent tinkerer) would have the obscure knowledge to get past that veil.</font><br>

[Fri Jul 08 21:05:25 2005] : <B>Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>One of them whispers, "Octagon."</font><br>
[Fri Jul 08 21:06:12 2005] : <B>Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>The voice is croaking and distorted, as if through a filter on a light rig.</font><br>

[Fri Jul 08 21:07:03 2005] : <B>Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>One of them puts on goggles, which take on a green glow as he scans the room. "Clean. No magic." His voice is disguised as well.</font><br>
[Fri Jul 08 21:07:29 2005] : <B>Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>"Subject, we are informed you have magical abilities. Please do not use them at present," the female says.</font><br>
[Fri Jul 08 21:07:53 2005] : <B>Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>They take you by the arm and hustle you out of the room, one creeping ahead noiselessly, the other two in front and behind you.</font><br>
[Fri Jul 08 21:07:58 2005] : <B>Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>They do not leave footprints in the dust.</font><br>
[Fri Jul 08 21:09:02 2005] : <B>Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>The one ahead of you fades almost out of visibility each time he passes through an area of deeper shadow; and as he flows out the window, the other two pick you up by the armpits and bring you with, landing without impact on the ground beneath.</font><br>
[Fri Jul 08 21:09:15 2005] : <B>Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>"We're carrying you so you leave no prints," the female voice whispers.</font><br>
[Fri Jul 08 21:10:17 2005] : <B>Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>The three agents breeze through the night, through the overgrown garden, over a fence into a back alley, up ziplines to rooftops, and after a short progress along rooftops, down through a hatch into an airless storage room.</font><br>
[Fri Jul 08 21:10:41 2005] : <font color='#008000'>** Rien follows them, obeying their instructions as if his life depends on it **</font><br>
[Fri Jul 08 21:10:59 2005] : <B>Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>"You will now be teleported. Prepare for disorientation. Step forward." One of them uncovers an object on the floor; it is a round stone disc, glowing a very faint green.</font><br>
[Fri Jul 08 21:11:22 2005] : <font color='#008000'>** Rien takes a deep breath and steps onto the disc **</font><br>
[Fri Jul 08 21:11:44 2005] : <B>Aryk</B>: <font color='#000080'>[1d12] -> [11] = (11)</font><br>

[Fri Jul 08 21:12:05 2005] : <B>Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>You've taken the large stepping discs from Atlantis to Lan'yaria before; this sensation is that, to an extreme: the smaller disc apparently concentrates the disorenting effect of the transit.</font><br>
[Fri Jul 08 21:12:38 2005] : <B>Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>You emerge, with nausea and dizziness, in a room brilliantly lit by reflector-focused lanterns.</font><br>
[Fri Jul 08 21:13:37 2005] : <B>Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>A man dressed in casual slightly-stained clothes slouches forward. "Holy ass," he says calmly. "That's Rien. Check the hair."</font><br>
[Fri Jul 08 21:14:01 2005] : <B>Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>His face is blurred, though not by any visible means; your astral vision makes it clear he's using a minor illusion.</font><br>
[Fri Jul 08 21:14:19 2005] : <B>Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>His voice, too, is distorted. Clearly all these operatives have glamors to hide their identities.</font><br>

[Fri Jul 08 21:15:19 2005] : <B>Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>The other person is dressed formally, severely, in cream and brown; her voice is much older, also distorted, face also blurred. She stands in a back corner of the room, which you now see as a magical workshop.</font><br>
[Fri Jul 08 21:15:42 2005] : <B>Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>The young man says, "On it, on it, please step forward into this cage."</font><br>
[Fri Jul 08 21:16:16 2005] : <B>Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>He wheels forward something that looks like a man-sized birdcage; it's not really a prison, as it's made of wires that look thin enough to bend or even rip your way out of.</font><br>
[Fri Jul 08 21:16:40 2005] : <font color='#008000'>** Rien steps into it hesitantly **</font><br>
[Fri Jul 08 21:17:07 2005] : <B>Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>"This won't hurt or anything." The young man says a word of invocation, and the cage vibrates for long seconds, the vibration passing from the top to the bottom.</font><br>
[Fri Jul 08 21:18:02 2005] : <B>Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>"Okay. Huh. I'm getting something."</font><br>
[Fri Jul 08 21:18:20 2005] : <B>Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>The woman steps forward immediately. "Coordinates?"</font><br>
[Fri Jul 08 21:18:47 2005] : <B>Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>The man rattles off a string of numbers, and as he does the woman rapidly adjusts controls on a handheld device that seems entirely made of knobs and switches.</font><br>
[Fri Jul 08 21:19:31 2005] : <B>Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>"Done." She presses a button, and the trinket rips up through your clothes, out of its inner pocket or your sock or whatever, to stick with a <i>clang</i> to a metal dome suspended from the ceiling.</font><br>
[Fri Jul 08 21:19:46 2005] : <B>Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>"That's our&#8212;" the young man starts, then stops.</font><br>
[Fri Jul 08 21:20:01 2005] : <B>Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>The woman presses another button, and the trinket falls from the dome into her hand.</font><br>

[Fri Jul 08 21:23:46 2005] : <B>Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>Which, as it turns out, it is; it has momentum, but he has to physically push it down to floor level before opening it.</font><br>

[Fri Jul 08 21:27:04 2005] : <B>Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>A completely palpable sense of weariness and relaxation washes over you immediately, and the world fades into a dreamy blur; and you hear voices, now unmodified, though you still don't recognize them.</font><br>

[Fri Jul 08 21:34:17 2005] : <B>Aryk</B>: <font color='#000080'>huh?</font><br>
[Fri Jul 08 21:34:24 2005] : <B>Aryk</B>: <font color='#000080'>did I just read what I think I read?</font><br>
[Fri Jul 08 21:34:29 2005] : <B>Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>I think you did.</font><br>
[Fri Jul 08 21:34:38 2005] : <B>Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>We knew they thought Rien was something he wasn't. And they wanted to show him who he truly was. And they exist to preserve dragon rule over the world.</font><br>
[Fri Jul 08 21:34:43 2005] : <B>Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>Dumbasses. I mean, come on.</font><br>
[Fri Jul 08 21:34:51 2005] : <B>Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>I never said they weren't!</font><br>
[Fri Jul 08 21:35:16 2005] : <B>Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>Proving a negative is tough, though.</font><br>
[Fri Jul 08 21:35:40 2005] : <B>Aryk</B>: <font color='#000080'>So, wait, they think Rien is Soleil?  But, hang on... what if he is?</font><br>
[Fri Jul 08 21:35:44 2005] : <B>Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>"Dark Eternal's adopted SON? What are you people, nuts?"</font><br>
[Fri Jul 08 21:35:48 2005] : <B>Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>no, he isn't</font><br>
[Fri Jul 08 21:35:57 2005] : <B>Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>morons</font><br>
[Fri Jul 08 21:36:05 2005] : <B>Aryk</B>: <font color='#000080'>I've always had a sneaking suspicion that Soleil is someone we may know already, or at least know of.</font><br>
[Fri Jul 08 21:36:10 2005] : <B>Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>Soleil popped up 20 years ago. Rien wasn't even toddling at the time.</font><br>

[Fri Jul 08 21:36:28 2005] : <B>Aryk</B>: <font color='#000080'>Okay, good point.</font><br>
[Fri Jul 08 21:36:30 2005] : <B>Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>Or whatever it is that whatever Rien is does at one year of age.</font><br>
[Fri Jul 08 21:36:33 2005] : <B>Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>Aryk: tell me that folder with the old character info doesn't say who he was in the last game. I'll fucking kill you for reading it. More.</font><br>
[Fri Jul 08 21:36:46 2005] : <B>Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>do what huh?</font><br>
[Fri Jul 08 21:36:53 2005] : <B>Aryk</B>: <font color='#000080'>No, I never read that stuff.</font><br>
[Fri Jul 08 21:36:55 2005] : <B>Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>Dorothea's got some guesses, but damned if I'll confirm 'em.</font><br>
[Fri Jul 08 21:37:52 2005] : <B>Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>And the fluff doesn't say Soleil appeared 20 years ago. Raven said the Archimandrite was running the show 20 years ago.</font><br>
[Fri Jul 08 21:38:00 2005] : <B>Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>And that he's been in the Society for 20 years.</font><br>
[Fri Jul 08 21:38:01 2005] : <B>Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>Ah, true.</font><br>
[Fri Jul 08 21:38:15 2005] : <B>Rien</B>: <font color='#004040'>ok</font><br>
[Fri Jul 08 21:38:15 2005] : <B>Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>I'm almost wondering if it'd make sense for Rien to... never mind.</font><br>
[Fri Jul 08 21:38:16 2005] : <B>Rien</B>: <font color='#004040'>I'm just</font><br>
[Fri Jul 08 21:38:17 2005] : <B>Rien</B>: <font color='#004040'>really</font><br>
[Fri Jul 08 21:38:17 2005] : <B>Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>I'll IM it.</font><br>
[Fri Jul 08 21:38:19 2005] : <B>Rien</B>: <font color='#004040'>in shock here</font><br>
[Fri Jul 08 21:38:28 2005] : <B>Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>The exact date of Soleil's assumption of power (or assumption of his predestined place) is meant to be fuzzy.</font><br>
[Fri Jul 08 21:38:36 2005] : <B>Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>Since of course, knowing it would narrow things down rather a lot.</font><br>
[Fri Jul 08 21:38:42 2005] : <B>Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>Indeed.</font><br>
[Fri Jul 08 21:39:00 2005] : <B>Aryk</B>: <font color='#000080'>Alll I ever glanced at from that old folder was something that talked about Taiyo, whom I came to figure out was Soleil in the old game.  After I figured out what I was reading, I immediately stopped.  Honest.</font><br>
[Fri Jul 08 21:39:01 2005] : <B>Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>Right now, it could be Aaron for all we know.</font><br>
[Fri Jul 08 21:39:11 2005] : <B>Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>Aight. :)</font><br>
[Fri Jul 08 21:39:17 2005] : <B>Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>Oh, that'd be cool. :)</font><br>
[Fri Jul 08 21:39:20 2005] : <B>Aryk</B>: <font color='#000080'>I think it's Carragio.</font><br>
[Fri Jul 08 21:39:20 2005] : <B>Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>I think that folder is from before the big revelation anyway.</font><br>
[Fri Jul 08 21:39:23 2005] : <B>Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>Renate would totally climb on board.</font><br>
[Fri Jul 08 21:39:34 2005] : <B>Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>After she kicked Aaron's sorry ass for not telling her.</font><br>
[Fri Jul 08 21:39:48 2005] : <B>Aryk</B>: <font color='#000080'>No, I think it's Isaiah Claine.</font><br>
[Fri Jul 08 21:39:57 2005] : <B>Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>Actually, Dorothea, I was toying with the idea of completely changing who and what Soleil is, to make it something completely out of left field, and Aaron came up as a plausible idea.</font><br>
[Fri Jul 08 21:40:02 2005] : <B>Aryk</B>: <font color='#000080'>It's time for him to step into the spotlight anyway.</font><br>
[Fri Jul 08 21:40:05 2005] : <B>Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>Yeah, I can see it working.</font><br>
[Fri Jul 08 21:40:09 2005] : <B>Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>He'd have to be carrying on his "leadership" entirely through coded communications.</font><br>
[Fri Jul 08 21:40:23 2005] : <B>Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>But nah, it's not Aaron.</font><br>
[Fri Jul 08 21:40:26 2005] : <B>Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>Well, in that case, Masan Ahim seems more likely.</font><br>
[Fri Jul 08 21:40:42 2005] : <B>Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>Good. Renate doesn't <i>want</i> to kick Aaron's ass.</font><br>
[Fri Jul 08 21:40:54 2005] : <B>Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>It totally embarrasses her that she probably can now.</font><br>
[Fri Jul 08 21:41:22 2005] : <B>Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>(If Aaron doesn't trot out the big ki-based stuff, anyway.)</font><br>
[Fri Jul 08 21:41:30 2005] : <B>Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>(Which she still can't do.)</font><br>
[Fri Jul 08 21:41:35 2005] : <B>Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>Who says there is any?</font><br>
[Fri Jul 08 21:41:41 2005] : <B>Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>Aaron. And Coris.</font><br>
[Fri Jul 08 21:41:50 2005] : <B>Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>And if they're BOTH snowing her, then they will BOTH hear about it.</font><br>
[Fri Jul 08 21:42:14 2005] : <B>Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>They might have misstated. It's meant to be a Zen style, where the "inner power" of the user is channeled into "real" moves instead of wu-xia stuff.</font><br>
[Fri Jul 08 21:42:25 2005] : <B>Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>Well, you know what I meant.</font><br>
[Fri Jul 08 21:42:29 2005] : <B>Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>Even its highest powers, like the Master's Blitz, are just zen-driven virtuosity.</font><br>
[Fri Jul 08 21:42:53 2005] : <B>Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>Wrenfall doesn't have "earth explodes in a wave toward the enemy."</font><br>
[Fri Jul 08 21:43:08 2005] : <B>Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>Well, I think Renate's picking up some zen at the moment. She almost has to.</font><br>
[Fri Jul 08 21:43:21 2005] : <B>Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>What else can you do, when half the time your world ends at your fingertips?</font><br>
[Fri Jul 08 21:43:39 2005] : <B>Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>Yep... like that scene from Zen and the Art of Archery where the master shoots the bullseye at midnight without looking.</font><br>
[Fri Jul 08 21:43:47 2005] : <B>Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>Quite.</font><br>
[Fri Jul 08 21:43:59 2005] : <B>Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>Aren't you horribly late, Alan?</font><br>
[Fri Jul 08 21:44:12 2005] : <B>Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>Well, I told her "between 9 and 10," so I have wiggle room.</font><br>
[Fri Jul 08 21:44:15 2005] : <B>Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>I'm about to call her.</font><br>
[Fri Jul 08 21:44:32 2005] : <B>Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>Okay.</font><br>
[Fri Jul 08 21:44:39 2005] : <B>Aryk</B>: <font color='#000080'>I gotta go too.  Me have killer migraine.</font><br>
[Fri Jul 08 21:45:02 2005] : <B>Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>oh, dear!</font><br>
[Fri Jul 08 21:45:06 2005] : <B>Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>take care of yourself, Matt!</font><br>
[Fri Jul 08 21:45:12 2005] : <B>Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>(and investigate your monitor settings)</font><br>
[Fri Jul 08 21:45:19 2005] : <B>Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>(more contrast and less brightness may be good)</font><br>
[Fri Jul 08 21:45:55 2005] : <B>Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>Now, I shouldn't have any trouble making the game next week, but in case I have connectivity issues, I'll call somebody.</font><br>
[Fri Jul 08 21:46:15 2005] : <B>Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>By the way, the entire pipeline isn't run by the Agrian Council&#8212;they have better uses for their time&#8212;but the new management is more willing to let third parties "buy" the subjects.</font><br>
[Fri Jul 08 21:46:20 2005] : <B>Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>Which can't last long, now can it?</font><br>
[Fri Jul 08 21:46:27 2005] : <B>Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>I wouldn't think so, no.</font><br>
[Fri Jul 08 21:46:40 2005] : <B>Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>Too many people knowing about it, too much chance for crossing purposes.</font><br>
[Fri Jul 08 21:46:56 2005] : <B>Aryk</B>: <font color='#000080'>I wil.  I can't figure out how to change my brightness on this cpu.</font><br>
[Fri Jul 08 21:47:35 2005] : <B>Aryk</B>: <font color='#000080'>Okay, see you all later.</font><br>
[Fri Jul 08 21:47:43 2005] : <B>Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>And potentially, Rien, Renate, and Aryk opening up cans of major whupass.</font><br>

[Fri Jul 08 21:47:56 2005] : <B>Aryk</B>: <font color='#000080'>Major.  Major.  Cans of whoopass.</font><br>
