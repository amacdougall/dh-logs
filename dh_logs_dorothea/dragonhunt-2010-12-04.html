You don't give yourself enough credit.  Let me tell you what I'm after.  A web.  Or net.  But like with... time.  Given some preparation, I think you can choose a spot and distort time around it.  You can handle more than one 'target.'  You've shown that when you use Matrix Dynamics.  And you obviously don't have to target a person or living thing or whatever to cast a spell.

[Sat Dec  4 19:43:51 2010] : <b>(6667) Alan</b>: <font color='#612769'>The core principle of that kind of magic is that you distort time, projecting magical power into a miniature time warp which causes a single blast of power to "play back" as a steady stream, supporting the spell.</font><br />
[Sat Dec  4 19:44:16 2010] : <b>(6667) Alan</b>: <font color='#612769'>Rien knows how to do it, but very few of his spells work that way, if any. All his magic is supported by a stream of magic directly from himself.</font><br />
[Sat Dec  4 19:45:06 2010] : <b>(6667) Alan</b>: <font color='#612769'>The time warp thing sounds complicated, and sure, the guy who came up with it must have been a genius, but magical research has wrapped it into something even a novice mage can manage.

[Sat Dec  4 19:45:34 2010] : <b>(6667) Alan</b>: <font color='#612769'>At first, of course, the stream of magic would play back too slow (so the spell fizzles after a bit) or too fast (so it overloads and burns out).</font><br />
[Sat Dec  4 19:46:01 2010] : <b>(6666) Rien</b>: <font color='#263607'>"Because you're talking about two completely different mechanics of magic, Aryk.  One is a self-sustaining or charged spell, and the other is powered by a channel running through me.  Sure, I could probably do this, but reliably?  Right now?  With no prior practice?  It could backfire and accelerate the target in time.</font><br />

"My lady, I see you've got magic armor already, I hope you don't mind if I spread the protection evenly. Emily, you need this, it's small enough it won't stop you from using that two-hander."</font><br />
[Sat Dec  4 21:20:14 2010] : <b>(6667) Alan</b>: <font color='#612769'>"This target shield doesn't look like much, but if you hold it up when a spell or dragon breath is coming at you, it'll block it. Only works three times, though."</font><br />
