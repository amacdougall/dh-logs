[Fri Jan  6 19:30:20 2006] : <B>(1) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>Traditionally, the noble family turns a blind eye to ancient folkways that may be at odds with the orthodoxy of the Sacred Alliance; but in Karlbotel, some superstitions run deep, and some Powers are never left unappeased, if only with offerings of milk and bread.</font><br>
[Fri Jan  6 19:31:21 2006] : <font color='#008000'>** (2) Rien rides with his back hunched, his dark cloak's hood pulled tight up over his head.

[Fri Jan  6 19:32:25 2006] : <B>(1) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>As Renate and her friends ride out past the town limits, a band of ash-painted mourners retreats into a thicket, dressed in thin rags, banded in thorns of penitence. The town priest would gently correct their actions if he saw them; but he is in his house, curled around a bottle, mourning his own inability to save the innocent.</font><br>
[Fri Jan  6 19:33:11 2006] : <B>(3) Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>"Saints and angels," Renate sighs, pulling Will-o'-the-Wisp to a stop.</font><br>

[Fri Jan  6 19:36:29 2006] : <B>(2) Rien</B>: <font color='#004040'>"Better not to disturb a ritual about which we know nothing," Rien says, quietly.</font><br>

[Fri Jan  6 19:39:14 2006] : <B>(1) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>A more cynical commentator might suggest that Emil's presence in the group is overdoing it.</font><br>

We cannot make them answer to anyone else, and we cannot make them believe what we want them to."</font><br>
[Fri Jan  6 19:44:37 2006] : <B>(3) Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>From the short gash on her forehead opened by a whiplike sapling, she might have started on the "old ways" already.</font><br>

[Fri Jan  6 19:45:40 2006] : <B>(1) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>Midge nods deliberately. "We was clearing stones off," she says conspiratorially. "Nothing else."</font><br>

[Fri Jan  6 23:11:34 2006] : <B>(4) Aryk</B>: <font color='#000080'>Well-played, both of you.</font><br>

[Fri Jan  6 23:12:16 2006] : <B>(2) Rien</B>: <font color='#004040'>thanks</font><br>
[Fri Jan  6 23:12:22 2006] : <B>(3) Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>yes, Adrian, well done</font><br>
[Fri Jan  6 23:12:28 2006] : <B>(3) Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>and I'm sorry I took up so much of the session</font><br>
[Fri Jan  6 23:12:40 2006] : <i><B>(4) Aryk</B> (whispering): <font color='#000080'>I replied.  Didn't you get it?</font></i><br>
[Fri Jan  6 23:12:45 2006] : <B>(2) Rien</B>: <font color='#004040'>meh, it's of a no nevermind</font><br>

[Fri Jan  6 23:12:53 2006] : <B>(4) Aryk</B>: <font color='#000080'>No worries.</font><br>
[Fri Jan  6 23:13:17 2006] : <i><B>(4) Aryk</B> (whispering): <font color='#000080'>Just keep me posted.</font></i><br>

[Fri Jan  6 23:13:29 2006] : <B>(2) Rien</B>: <font color='#004040'>what Renate was doing needed to be done, so it was done</font><br>
[Fri Jan  6 23:13:48 2006] : <B>(3) Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>poor kid, she was just getting her feet under her again, and wham!</font><br>
[Fri Jan  6 23:14:00 2006] : <B>(4) Aryk</B>: <font color='#000080'>Yeah, really.</font><br>
[Fri Jan  6 23:14:08 2006] : <B>(3) Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>no priestess, no temple, no brother, and no people</font><br>
[Fri Jan  6 23:14:54 2006] : <B>(4) Aryk</B>: <font color='#000080'>I'd say she's bottomed out.  At least Sabine was a bit of a comfort to her.</font><br>
[Fri Jan  6 23:15:14 2006] : <B>(3) Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>Sabine definitely helped. She isn't taking the rejection personally any more.</font><br>
[Fri Jan  6 23:15:52 2006] : <B>(3) Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>It also turns her mind outward a little bit, which isn't necessarily a bad thing; she needs to get her game on in the larger stage.</font><br>
[Fri Jan  6 23:15:57 2006] : <B>(4) Aryk</B>: <font color='#000080'>That's good.  Still, as rough as Aryk and Rien have had it of late, Renate's got 'em hands down.</font><br>
[Fri Jan  6 23:16:12 2006] : <B>(3) Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>Well, nobody's killed anybody unexpectedly in front of her!</font><br>
[Fri Jan  6 23:16:47 2006] : <B>(3) Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>What are folks' plans for this weekend, btw?</font><br>
[Fri Jan  6 23:16:51 2006] : <B>(2) Rien</B>: <font color='#004040'>No, but her boyfriend's dispised father did send a magical creation into <i>her home</i></font><br>
[Fri Jan  6 23:17:00 2006] : <B>(3) Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>heh, yes, there is that</font><br>
[Fri Jan  6 23:17:17 2006] : <B>(2) Rien</B>: <font color='#004040'>my plans are, as ever, flexible</font><br>
[Fri Jan  6 23:17:37 2006] : <B>(2) Rien</B>: <font color='#004040'>20th and 21st of May I'll be totally unavailable</font><br>
[Fri Jan  6 23:17:46 2006] : <B>(4) Aryk</B>: <font color='#000080'>I don't know what's going on tomorrow, other than I have to get up early and get my buddy and his wife to the airport.  Sunday I'll be in Chicago.</font><br>
[Fri Jan  6 23:18:16 2006] : <B>(3) Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>well, if you can drop on sometime, perhaps we can finally play out the fluff scene</font><br>
[Fri Jan  6 23:18:24 2006] : <B>(3) Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>if you go to bed now ;)</font><br>
[Fri Jan  6 23:19:13 2006] : <B>(4) Aryk</B>: <font color='#000080'>Right, and right.  Well, yeah, I am going to bed now.  Trememdous migraine.  Had it all day.  I know, whine whine whine.  Anyway, maybe I can catch you all tomorrow.  </font><br>
