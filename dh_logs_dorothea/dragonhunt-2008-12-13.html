[Sat Dec 13 10:09:13 2008] : <b>(19847) Alan</b>: <font color='#000080'>A smoke shop draws Aryk's attention: it has a big public front porch, with two levels, sparsely populated with idlers playing dice, drinking, and smoking pipes or cigars.</font><br />
[Sat Dec 13 10:09:58 2008] : <b>(19847) Alan</b>: <font color='#000080'>Unlike most gatherings, this one seems to have both tokens in equal proportion.</font><br />

[Sat Dec 13 10:14:35 2008] : <b>(19846) Aryk</b>: <font color='#710000'>(Not that he has anything to hide, but you get different responses from people who think they're talking to some stranger over people who think they're talking to a famous warrior.)</font><br />
[Sat Dec 13 10:16:06 2008] : <b>(19847) Alan</b>: <font color='#000080'>The proprietor of the shop, recognizable by his blue-striped apron, waves Aryk over. "Have a cigar, stranger. Last of the Queradas. On the house, I'm giving away the rest of my stock."</font><br />
[Sat Dec 13 10:16:38 2008] : <b>(19846) Aryk</b>: <font color='#710000'>Actually, Aryk first goes inside the shop and buys some tobacco and papers, and something to fill his flask with.  Then he'll go over to the fellows on the porch behind the telescop and find an empty seat, and roll himself up a smoke.  While doing so, he idly says, "What's with the telescope?"</font><br />
[Sat Dec 13 10:16:48 2008] : <b>(19847) Alan</b>: <font color='#000080'>There are pyramidal stacks of cigars, some still bundled into hexagons, on an outside counter.</font><br />
[Sat Dec 13 10:18:20 2008] : <b>(19847) Alan</b>: <font color='#000080'>Also rolling papers, loose tobacco, pipe tobacco, the whole gamut. A large poster just says "BURN RATE," with a bold painting of a Michaelite lighting a cigar from his sword.</font><br />

[Sat Dec 13 10:21:59 2008] : <b>(19847) Alan</b>: <font color='#000080'>Now Aryk sees a couple of tiny specks, maybe.</font><br />

[Sat Dec 13 10:24:07 2008] : <b>(19846) Aryk</b>: <font color='#710000'>"Yeah," says Aryk, sitting back down and returning to his roll-up.  "I can't figure out what's going on here.

[Sat Dec 13 10:24:16 2008] : <b>(19847) Alan</b>: <font color='#000080'>Aryk has maybe heard of Marco Delgado, owner of the only intercontinental Lan'yarian airship fleet; they move luxury goods.</font><br />
[Sat Dec 13 10:24:45 2008] : <b>(19847) Alan</b>: <font color='#000080'>Aryk would have heard of him because of his notorious playboy lifestyle, not the underlying economics.</font><br />

[Sat Dec 13 11:52:25 2008] : <b>(19846) Aryk</b>: <font color='#710000'>(That was a good Rien line.)</font><br />
[Sat Dec 13 11:52:33 2008] : <b>(19845) Renate</b>: <font color='#000080'>Oh, I have something vaguely resembling a strategy in place already.</font><br />

[Sat Dec 13 11:52:55 2008] : <b>(19847) Alan</b>: <font color='#000080'>Oh, we'll let the chips fall where they may.</font><br />
[Sat Dec 13 11:53:30 2008] : <b>(19845) Renate</b>: <font color='#000080'>It will be interesting to see what happens when we tell Leonid -- not that he's a tool, but that everyone THINKS he is.</font><br />
[Sat Dec 13 11:53:38 2008] : <b>(19846) Aryk</b>: <font color='#710000'>Well, that was a lot of good info for Renate, anyway.</font><br />
[Sat Dec 13 11:53:46 2008] : <b>(19845) Renate</b>: <font color='#000080'>yes, well done, Aryk!</font><br />
[Sat Dec 13 11:54:09 2008] : <b>(19846) Aryk</b>: <font color='#710000'>Bah, it wasn't really because of anything Aryk said that we got the info.</font><br />
[Sat Dec 13 11:54:17 2008] : <b>(19845) Renate</b>: <font color='#000080'>sure it was!</font><br />
[Sat Dec 13 11:54:30 2008] : <b>(19845) Renate</b>: <font color='#000080'>he was keeping up with the convo despite being a bit the worse for caipirinhas</font><br />
[Sat Dec 13 11:54:52 2008] : <b>(19846) Aryk</b>: <font color='#710000'>Yeah, well, one beer pretty much takes care of Aryk.</font><br />
[Sat Dec 13 11:55:36 2008] : <b>(19846) Aryk</b>: <font color='#710000'>Well, Rinoa only destroyed one thing while we were playing.  That went pretty well.</font><br />

[Sat Dec 13 11:56:40 2008] : <b>(19846) Aryk</b>: <font color='#710000'>Although that is a pretty funny image, if I do say so myself.  A swarm of babies.</font><br />

[Sat Dec 13 11:57:05 2008] : <b>(19846) Aryk</b>: <font color='#710000'>heh heh</font><br />
[Sat Dec 13 11:57:08 2008] : <b>(19845) Renate</b>: <font color='#000080'>so what's this about new jobs?</font><br />
[Sat Dec 13 11:58:11 2008] : <b>(19846) Aryk</b>: <font color='#710000'>Our insurance just went up bigtime again, and we're beginning to realize that the raises we can expect over the years are still going to keep us at "good job" level and not "career" level.</font><br />
[Sat Dec 13 12:00:02 2008] : <b>(19847) Alan</b>: <font color='#000080'>Yeah... when you reach the age and competence level where you realize there's even a difference between a good job and a career, that's a step.</font><br />
[Sat Dec 13 12:00:05 2008] : <b>(19846) Aryk</b>: <font color='#710000'>Jenny's already put in a few resume's to places.  I'm going to hold off until February, possibly, to see what kind of raise I'm going to get.  For all the skills I have there now, I really should get a very nice one.  Not to mention I've turned the sketch department around, like, 360.  So if I get a quarter or something, I'm out of there.</font><br />
[Sat Dec 13 12:00:28 2008] : <b>(19846) Aryk</b>: <font color='#710000'>This place really could be a career, but it doesn't pay like one.</font><br />
[Sat Dec 13 12:00:48 2008] : <b>(19845) Renate</b>: <font color='#000080'>well, given the economy, they may not be able to charge enough to pay you better</font><br />
[Sat Dec 13 12:01:06 2008] : <b>(19847) Alan</b>: <font color='#000080'>Yeah, this is kind of a bad time to be job-hunting, but you never know.</font><br />
[Sat Dec 13 12:01:28 2008] : <b>(19846) Aryk</b>: <font color='#710000'>On top of that, ever since they fired one of our sales people, who was a good friend and great at what he did, our workload has been cut in half, so they've been having me work on the most bullshit things to fill the time.</font><br />
[Sat Dec 13 12:01:58 2008] : <b>(19846) Aryk</b>: <font color='#710000'>They may not, but I know that they charge our customers 50 dollars and hour for the time I put in, and I make 13.</font><br />
[Sat Dec 13 12:02:49 2008] : <b>(19846) Aryk</b>: <font color='#710000'>For what I do I should be making 20, but I'd settle on 18.</font><br />
[Sat Dec 13 12:03:12 2008] : <b>(19846) Aryk</b>: <font color='#710000'>There's very little chance I'll get a 5 dollar raise.</font><br />
[Sat Dec 13 12:04:14 2008] : <b>(19845) Renate</b>: <font color='#000080'>well, good luck to you both</font><br />
[Sat Dec 13 12:04:19 2008] : <b>(19846) Aryk</b>: <font color='#710000'>Thanks.  </font><br />
[Sat Dec 13 12:04:45 2008] : <b>(19846) Aryk</b>: <font color='#710000'>Too bad.  I like what I do there.  When I'm doing it.  </font><br />
[Sat Dec 13 12:05:08 2008] : <b>(19845) Renate</b>: <font color='#000080'>well, it honestly sounds to me like the company is in trouble</font><br />
[Sat Dec 13 12:05:17 2008] : <b>(19845) Renate</b>: <font color='#000080'>so the sooner at least ONE of you gets a job elsewhere, the better</font><br />
[Sat Dec 13 12:05:39 2008] : <b>(19846) Aryk</b>: <font color='#710000'>Last night I spent the whole night trying to figure out how the Milwaukee Brewers' racing sausages can ride motorcycles.</font><br />
[Sat Dec 13 12:06:04 2008] : <b>(19846) Aryk</b>: <font color='#710000'>I'm not sure.  I think that sometimes, but we're still pulling in a good profit, and we've bought three other companies this year alone.</font><br />
[Sat Dec 13 12:07:28 2008] : <b>(19846) Aryk</b>: <font color='#710000'>Asi es la vida.  I guess I'll talk to you both soon, then.  Have a good weekend.</font><br />
