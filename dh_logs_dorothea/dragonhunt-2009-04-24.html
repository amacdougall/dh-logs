[Fri Apr 24 22:20:54 2009] : <b>(25606) Alan</b>: <font color='#000080'>Well, I've got a sort of minigame set up, to fill in a little space while Adrian's away, and make some use of Chenji before we kick him back to Valin.</font><br />
[Fri Apr 24 22:21:32 2009] : <b>(25606) Alan</b>: <font color='#000080'>Matt, I've made up a few spirits from time to time for Chenji to summon, but of course Aryk just destroyed one of the biggest baddest ones. Or at least baddest.</font><br />
[Fri Apr 24 22:21:39 2009] : <b>(25609) Aryk</b>: <font color='#710000'>Do you want to do Renate's single thing and I'll play a filler character?</font><br />
[Fri Apr 24 22:21:54 2009] : <b>(25610) Renate</b>: <font color='#000080'>I think this is Renate's filler thing and Chenji *is* the filler character. :)</font><br />
[Fri Apr 24 22:22:23 2009] : <b>(25610) Renate</b>: <font color='#000080'>She will be peevish. She misses her brother like whoa.</font><br />
[Fri Apr 24 22:22:29 2009] : <b>(25606) Alan</b>: <font color='#000080'>So while I pour this coffee, brainstorm up five or six, with general power sets. Think of Chenji as taking on the persona of one spirit at a time, each with its own three or four related powers, sort of like switching styles.</font><br />
[Fri Apr 24 22:22:40 2009] : <b>(25609) Aryk</b>: <font color='#710000'>I have a decent idea about Chenji's abilities.  But I figured that Chenji already took off since the point of his mission was moot, which was funny.</font><br />
[Fri Apr 24 22:22:55 2009] : <b>(25606) Alan</b>: <font color='#000080'>(If he's a summoner, that's how summoners work!)</font><br />
[Fri Apr 24 22:22:59 2009] : <b>(25610) Renate</b>: <font color='#000080'>and miss Karlbotel high tea?</font><br />
[Fri Apr 24 22:23:06 2009] : <b>(25609) Aryk</b>: <font color='#710000'>Is there anybody else I could play that would fit?  If not, Chenji's fine.</font><br />
[Fri Apr 24 22:23:21 2009] : <b>(25606) Alan</b>: <font color='#000080'>Summoners either channel spirits (like Chenji) or summon them but can't act independently while they're out (like FF10).</font><br />
[Fri Apr 24 22:23:28 2009] : <b>(25610) Renate</b>: <font color='#000080'>Daniel?</font><br />
[Fri Apr 24 22:23:49 2009] : <b>(25606) Alan</b>: <font color='#000080'>Oh, if Chenji should be gone already, Daniel would work.</font><br />

[Fri Apr 24 22:24:00 2009] : <b>(25606) Alan</b>: <font color='#000080'>Lemme run and put this coffee to steep.</font><br />
[Fri Apr 24 22:24:04 2009] : <b>(25609) Aryk</b>: <font color='#710000'>Daniel might be fun.</font><br />
[Fri Apr 24 22:24:06 2009] : <b>(25606) Alan</b>: <font color='#000080'>Well, decide! It's up to you, it's for fun.</font><br />

[Fri Apr 24 22:33:28 2009] : <b>(25606) Alan</b>: <font color='#000080'>He has Faultless Defense instead of Fortress Defense -- same concept, but it greatly reduces damage taken instead of increasing his evasion. Think of it as a weaker version of Splitfire actually.</font><br />

[Fri Apr 24 23:41:31 2009] : <b>(25610) Tancred</b>: <font color='#000080'>"What's the name of this library, Prince Rien?"</font><br />
[Fri Apr 24 23:42:47 2009] : <b>(25613) Rien</b>: <font color='#003300'>"Overall, the Library of the University of Eldorado.  And I think that no knowledge is complete if it's not shared.  It's wasted ink and paper if it's forever to be locked away and never to be known."</font><br />
[Fri Apr 24 23:43:46 2009] : <b>(25610) Tancred</b>: <font color='#000080'>"<em>This</em> Library. It's the Sealed Library. Sealed as in shut up tighter than a dragon's lair. Do you have any idea how much trouble I would get into?"</font><br />
[Fri Apr 24 23:44:23 2009] : <b>(25613) Rien</b>: <font color='#003300'>"Why not ask, first?  You never know the response you'll get until you try."</font><br />

[Fri Apr 24 23:45:37 2009] : <b>(25613) Rien</b>: <font color='#003300'>"So I can find out my part in it."</font><br />
[Fri Apr 24 23:46:16 2009] : <b>(25610) Tancred</b>: <font color='#000080'>"Ah. Well."</font><br />
[Fri Apr 24 23:46:22 2009] : <b>(25610) Tancred</b>: <font color='#000080'>"That would be a reason."</font><br />
[Fri Apr 24 23:46:25 2009] : <b>(25610) Tancred</b>: <font color='#000080'>"Wouldn't it."</font><br />

[Fri Apr 24 23:47:26 2009] : <b>(25610) Tancred</b>: <font color='#000080'>"Okay. It can't be <em>worse</em> than Absalom. Pick a table and put on the cotton gloves in the right-hand drawer."</font><br />

[Fri Apr 24 23:51:07 2009] : <b>(25610) Tancred</b>: <font color='#000080'>"One of these has what I can give you," he says, somewhat inscrutably. Are the other two books merely decoys?</font><br />
[Fri Apr 24 23:51:33 2009] : <b>(25613) Rien</b>: <font color='#003300'>"And the others?</font><br />
[Fri Apr 24 23:52:40 2009] : <b>(25610) Tancred</b>: <font color='#000080'>Tancred shrugs. "The others... are others. Good hunting, Prince."</font><br />
[Fri Apr 24 23:53:29 2009] : <b>(25606) Alan</b>: <font color='#000080'>All three books are untitled, with no authors, no publication information, and no labeling or even library filing information.</font><br />
[Fri Apr 24 23:54:45 2009] : <b>(25606) Alan</b>: <font color='#000080'>Each is hand-set in a different archaic typeface; all three are in classical Elven, in the heightened usage common to the baroque prewar era.</font><br />
[Fri Apr 24 23:55:45 2009] : <b>(25606) Alan</b>: <font color='#000080'>If they are about the Dragon War, that means they must have been written and set directly afterwards, before the backlash against elven civilization; or written during and set later.</font><br />
[Fri Apr 24 23:58:00 2009] : <b>(25606) Alan</b>: <font color='#000080'>Each is written in the first person; at a first glance, Rien cannot tell who any of the narrators are, although several names come up repeatedly in all three, such as Dominique XXI, Tristan Laurent, and especially Alexandre Rousseau.</font><br />
[Fri Apr 24 23:58:57 2009] : <b>(25606) Alan</b>: <font color='#000080'>But Rien realizes almost immediately which of the books he should be focusing on, because reading it, he feels an instant and piercing sense of familiarity, like hearing the voice of a long-lost family member.</font><br />
