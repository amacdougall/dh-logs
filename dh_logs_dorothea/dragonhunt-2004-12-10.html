		    2000 years ago, <strong>dragons</strong> burst into the sky, conquering all that lay before them. Now, 2000 years later, dragons rule the earth, some with benevolence, some with <strong>tyranny</strong>. And sometimes, in their endless struggles for power and domination, it becomes necessary for a <strong>dragon</strong> to die by <strong>human</strong> hands.

<p><b>Alan</b>: Log is on.</p>
<p><b>Alan</b>: Ah, hey!</p>
<p><b>Aryk</b>: There she is!</p>
<p><b>Alan</b>: Log off for a sec.</p>
<p><b>Alan</b>: What's up?</p>
<p><b>Eleanor</b>: late, sorry</p>
<p><b>Eleanor</b>: here now :)</p>
<p><b>Alabaster Sunshine</b>: Hola!</p>
<p><b>Alan</b>: No prob.</p>
<p><b>Alan</b>: We were just sitting around doing nothing.</p>
<p><b>Aryk</b>: We were so worried.... sniff sniff</p>
<p><b>Alan</b>: And we're about to start.</p>
<p><b>Eleanor</b>: awwwwwwwwh</p>
<p><b>Alabaster Sunshine</b>: Talking about the Undead and Rap</p>
<p><b>Alan</b>: Everyone ready?</p>
<p><b>Aryk</b>: Yup</p>
<p>** Alabaster Sunshine preparing to Lurk **</p>
<p><b>Eleanora</b>: yep</p>
<p><b>Alan</b>: Earthday, 23 Seventh 1995, dawns hot and muggy. Morning mist evaporates from cobblestones and streetweave, as feet and wagon-wheels begin the day's punishment.</p>
<p><b>Alan</b>: (Log is on, I might add.)</p>
<p><b>Alan</b>: Ilium has been quiet the last few weeks; no major crimes, no political scandals or upheavals, no international incidents, not even a festival or major cultural event.</p>
<p><b>Eleanora</b>: (you mean Glenworth might have made the papers? yikes)</p>
<p><b>Alan</b>: The Golden Gossip joked that things have been so quiet, he or she might have to sleep with a noble him or her self, just to have something to dish dirt about.</p>
<p><b>Aryk</b>: (It hasn't helped matters that Renate and Rien have been out of town, and Aryk's kept an extremely low profile.)</p>
<p><b>Eleanora</b>: (ha -- try it!)</p>
<p><b>Alan</b>: Had Aryk been a newspaper-reading type, he might have noticed a back-page article in the sporting section about a small tournament near the eastern border, in which a member of Heaven was guest of honor.</p>
<p><b>Aryk</b>: (But since he's not, he didn't.)</p>
<p><b>Alan</b>: If he had, though, his limited supply of caution wouldn't have been overly exercised. Nobody seems to have considered that the honor might have been a token of actual alliance.</p>
<p><b>Eleanora</b>: (ARGH! Think, people, think!)</p>
<p><b>Eleanora</b>: (Even if it hurts!)</p>
<p><b>Alan</b>: Of course, it's entirely possible that The Authorities have taken close notice... but The Authorities, in the Silver Coast as in Andragar, play their cards close to the chest.</p>
<p><b>Eleanora</b>: (well, fine... if Renate's subversive little expedition is going to slide through under the radar, that's all well and good)</p>
<p><b>Alan</b>: (Well, the occasional Heaven knight is treated as a guest of honor anywhere in the Silver Coast, for two reasons. One, why antagonize them? And two, some of them are genuine, if not entirely trusted, heroes.)</p>
<p><b>Eleanora</b>: (true)</p>
<p><b>Alan</b>: (It's safe to bet that Will, for instance, wasn't travelling entirely incognito when he passed through during Chapter 3.)</p>
<p><b>Alan</b>: (Perhaps if Renate asked around...?)</p>
<p><b>Alan</b>: (Quite off topic, though.)</p>
<p><b>Aryk</b>: Aryk's up early, for a change, and is already nervous as all hell.</p>
<p><b>Eleanora</b>: (yes, well, Coris has news on that point that he's Not Sharing)</p>
<p><b>Alan</b>: Aryk, your trajectory? Arretia already handled pre-registration; all you two have to do is show up at Gunner's Heaven at 4:00 pm.</p>
<p><b>Alan</b>: (Gimme a sec, Dave's here.)</p>
<p><b>Aryk</b>: Aryk will get breakfast at Carragio's (something easy on his stomach), get enough coffee to last 3 days, and meet up with Arretia around noon to do a final practice run.</p>
<p><b>Aryk</b>: He doesn't have much material yet, but that won't matter much considering it's a freestyle competition anyway.</p>
<p><b>Eleanora</b>: (pray?)</p>
<p><b>Aryk</b>: (He spent a large chunk of the previous day praying.  He's going to do a bit before his turn in the comp, too.)</p>
<p><b>Eleanora</b>: (just checkin')</p>
<p><b>Eleanora</b>: (what's Ricard got to say about all this?)</p>
<p><b>Aryk</b>: (So far, nothing, strangely enough.  Maybe he appreciates that Aryk is in his own way spreading the word of Michael.)</p>
<p><b>Aryk</b>: (He may still be a little salty that Aryk dogged him for Emily that one time.)</p>
<p><b>Eleanora</b>: (Er, yes, I shouldn't wonder.)</p>
<p><b>Aryk</b>: (But he already got a thorough day-long lecture for that one.)</p>
<p><b>Alan</b>: (Okay, sorry about that.)</p>
<p><b>Eleanora</b>: (owie... and with no Renate to give him a pat on the shoulder, either)</p>
<p><b>Alan</b>: (I'm officially done socializing.)</p>
<p><b>Aryk</b>: (Jeez... DM's these days...)</p>
<p><b>Alan</b>: Yeah, Ricard hasn't said much so far.</p>
<p><b>Aryk</b>: (And Aryk hasn't asked him his opinion, in case he gets another lecture)</p>
<p><b>Alan</b>: He hasn't discouraged you, at least.</p>
<p><b>Alan</b>: Anyway, yep, at Lambard's, there's a small crowd of teenagers (Ilium bars aren't so strict about age restrictions), apparently Arretia's friends.</p>
<p><b>Alan</b>: She's playing some sort of poppy fluff for them.</p>
<p><b>Alan</b>: (There are laws on the books about drinking age, if you're curious, but they're enforced largely through random constable checks, and ignored mainly through bribery.)</p>
<p><b>Alan</b>: (It's considered an issue for parenting more than policing.)</p>
<p><b>Alan</b>: "Yo, Aryk! Drop a phat one!"</p>
<p><b>Aryk</b>: Aryk shows up out of gear, for the first time possibly in years.  He looks a lot more street-friendly.</p>
<p><b>Alan</b>: (This is your chance to power up your rhyme muscle; there'll be five rounds, and of the first three it's going to be strophe, antistrophe, judgment.)</p>
<p><b>Aryk</b>: "Yo, gimme somthin' to rap to, then."</p>
<p><b>Alan</b>: Arretia keeps the fluff, but drops in a tuba and tanko beat so bass-laden you'd swear it was being played by Leviathan.</p>
<p><b>Aryk</b>: "I've been patiently waiting for my chance to explode </p>
<p><b>Aryk</b>: Feels like I've climbed this fuckin' mountain on tiptoes</p>
<p><b>Aryk</b>: Females love me cuz I got a phat pimp-stroll</p>
<p><b>Aryk</b>: People love my lyrics / cherish them like gold</p>
<p><b>Aryk</b>: The day of judgement has come / now's my chance to expose</p>
<p><b>Alan</b>: (That's where Arretia drops in a hook, some froofy singer crooning something about loving the big boys with the long swords.)</p>
<p><b>Alan</b>: She raises an eyebrow at your tongue-tied ass. :)</p>
<p><b>Aryk</b>: The tyranny of evil men and the and the fuckin' dragons firm hold</p>
<p><b>Aryk</b>: On your life / It's time for a revolt</p>
<p><b>Aryk</b>: It's time for the transition from boy to man</p>
<p><b>Aryk</b>: It's time to implement the glorious plan</p>
<p><b>Aryk</b>: To spread the word like butter on flan</p>
<p><b>Alan</b>: The kids laugh at this one.</p>
<p><b>Aryk</b>: It's time to move up and out this garbage can</p>
<p><b>Aryk</b>: Into the world of big boys with long swords, man</p>
<p><i>whispering to Aryk,  what about little girls with long swords?</i> </p>
<p><b>Aryk</b>: "</p>
<p><b>Aryk</b>: "I got a stomach ache."</p>
<p><b>Aryk</b>: Aryk runs into an alley.</p>
<p><b>Alan</b>: Arretia drops the hook again, this time letting it complete to where the singer says that she prefers a guy who knows how to do the right thing.</p>
<p><b>Alan</b>: "And, um, that's our show!" she says into the sound system, and follows Aryk outside.</p>
<p><i>whispering to Aryk,  poor thing!</i> </p>
<p><b>Alan</b>: "You okay?"</p>
<p><b>Aryk</b>: Aryk hurls into a garbage can.  He glances at her as she walks up and wipes his mouth.</p>
<p><b>Alan</b>: "Here, um, have a hankie."</p>
<p><b>Aryk</b>: "You know... I fought a dragon once.  I thought I was scared then."</p>
<p><b>Aryk</b>: "Hah!"</p>
<p><b>Aryk</b>: "Er.... thanks."</p>
<p><b>Alan</b>: "C'mon, this'll be a piece of cake. What are they going to do, kill you?"</p>
<p><b>Alan</b>: "Just pretend they're all demons, only without setting them on fire and slaying them."</p>
<p><b>Aryk</b>: "Nah, probably not.  This is like, a big chance for me, you know?"</p>
<p>** Aryk takes a flask out of his pocket and downs some coffee. **</p>
<p><b>Aryk</b>: "Aren't you nervous?"</p>
<p><b>Alan</b>: "Heck, no. I've been waiting for this!"</p>
<p><b>Aryk</b>: "Yeah, me too."  Aryk shrugs.  "I'll  be okay."</p>
<p><b>Alan</b>: "You know what they say, right? If you sit down and study one thing, <i>really</i> study it, for a single year, do nothing else..."</p>
<p><b>Alan</b>: "...you can become the best there is."</p>
<p><b>Alan</b>: "It's just a matter of dedication."</p>
<p><b>Aryk</b>: "I've never been much of one for studying."</p>
<p><b>Aryk</b>: "My idea of studying is using a book for a pillow and hoping the knowledge just sort of gets... absorbed."</p>
<p><b>Alan</b>: "Well, sure, that's a viable route too. In <i>stupid-land!</i>"</p>
<p><i>whispering to Aryk,  Arretia's Supportiveness stat must be about a 2.</i> </p>
<p><b>Alan</b>: Arretia punches you in the arm.</p>
<p><b>Alan</b>: "C'mon, you were fine. Let's get to Gunner's Heaven. You can mingle with the competition, see how utterly lame they are."</p>
<p><b>Aryk</b>: "Hmph.  There is something you should know, Arretia.  When we do this... I'm not going to hold anything back, if you know what I mean.  I'm going to speak my mind.  So if you have any concerns about your reputation, or you know, personal safety, it's not too late to turn back."</p>
<p><b>Alan</b>: Arretia laughs. "If it gets that bad, I'll just tell them you forced me at swordpoint."</p>
<p><b>Alan</b>: "Then you'll <i>really</i> get it."</p>
<p><b>Aryk</b>: "Works for me."</p>
<p><b>Alan</b>: "Well, what do you need? It's not too late to back out, if you really want."</p>
<p><b>Aryk</b>: "Let's mingle."</p>
<p><b>Alan</b>: "Okay."</p>
<p>** Aryk grabs some of the sound equipment and sets off. **</p>
<p><b>Alan</b>: <hr /></p>
<p><b>Alan</b>: Gunner's Heaven is a combination dojo and cafe in Southtown, run by Deadly Fighter Orville Timberlake.</p>
<p><b>Alan</b>: It's the only place where you can watch a mage and a knight face off, followed by a poetry reading.</p>
<p><b>Aryk</b>: (Oh, I remember.  And hopefully Orville doesn't remember me.)</p>
<p><b>Alan</b>: This time, a wooden stage has been temporarily erected over the rock garden, in just the right position for weak MCs to be pushed into the koi pool.</p>
<p>** Aryk 's shirtless with some baggy pants and combat boots, and has a cap on backwards and tilted to the side. **</p>
<p><b>Aryk</b>: (LOL)</p>
<p><b>Alan</b>: Everyone here looks like some sort of tough; at least a solid half of them are just projecting an image, though.</p>
<p><b>Alan</b>: One or two have demon power; none of them are even as strong with their patrons as Aryk, though. Strictly bush league.</p>
<p><b>Aryk</b>: (That's good.)</p>
<p><b>Alan</b>: A few others betray some sort of aura, but whether it's ki, arcane, or planar isn't clear.</p>
<p><b>Alan</b>: Aryk can't detect divine powers other than angelic and demonic.</p>
<p>** Eleanora is sitting casually at the bar, casting a proprietary eye over the proceedings. **</p>
<p><b>Alan</b>: After observing for a few minutes, you can clearly make out centers of influence.</p>
<p><b>Alan</b>: Arretia points people out to you: "Okay, see that guy in the horrible shirt, with the greasy hair?"</p>
<p><b>Aryk</b>: "Uh-huh?  Kind of looks like Hermit..."</p>
<p><b>Alan</b>: There's a tall pale man whose wet-looking rat-tail goes poorly with his receding hairline; his shirt is a ghastly blue-and-green tribal flame motif.</p>
<p><b>Aryk</b>: "Only... greasier..."</p>
<p><b>Alan</b>: "Kind of, but Hermit's short and stocky. This guy's got the same fashion sense, only without being able to, you know, pull it off."</p>
<p><b>Aryk</b>: "I can see that."</p>
<p><b>Alan</b>: "He's Hadley Domingo. Unfortunately, Ilium's best promoter."</p>
<p><b>Aryk</b>: "Hmmm.. so don't piss him off, then, eh?"</p>
<p><b>Alan</b>: "He has all the contacts, which means he has all the power. Without him, nobody knows anybody."</p>
<p><b>Alan</b>: "He's running this show. Plus, I heard he landed the deal to set up the Black Ops Tour."</p>
<p><b>Alan</b>: "That's major karma for him. He must have done something right."</p>
<p><b>Aryk</b>: "Really?  Huh."</p>
<p><b>Alan</b>: "If you're going to be working with Purgatory on that, you're going to be dealing with Domingo a lot anyway."</p>
<p><b>Aryk</b>: "Let's hope so."</p>
<p><b>Alan</b>: "Okay, see the guy over there, in the silver robe with the blue lightning bolts on it? And the red hair and the green shades?"</p>
<p><b>Alan</b>: This man's fashion sense isn't "bad," because "bad" would imply that you could apply outside standards to it.</p>
<p><b>Eleanora</b>: (His name is Christmas Tree!)</p>
<p><b>Alan</b>: No, the man Arretia is pointing out lives in his own highly idiosyncratic fashion universe, in which he is sole ruler and demigod.</p>
<p><b>Aryk</b>: (LOL)</p>
<p><b>Aryk</b>: "What the...?"</p>
<p><b>Alan</b>: "That's Purple Eon. He's what they call a 'lineman' in Andragar. Because he manages 'lines of supply.' Around here, we just call him a dealer."</p>
<p><b>Alan</b>: "He hits all the major underground shows, makes them 'better.'"</p>
<p><b>Alan</b>: "He's harmless. Ties to the Black Sheep, at least, which is as close to honorable as his type gets."</p>
<p><b>Aryk</b>: "What... for like equipment?  Or like..." Aryk whispers, "drugs?"</p>
<p><b>Alan</b>: Arretia rolls her eyes. "No, for flour and yeast."</p>
<p><b>Aryk</b>: "Huh.  I don't really see why people would need baking stuff at a show, but ah well.  I guess I don't know the industry that well."</p>
<p><b>Alan</b>: (This is actually a really good chance to introduce characters for the next chapter.)</p>
<p><b>Alan</b>: "Right, okay, whatever, St. Aryk. Now over there, that dwarf who's shaking every hand that passes by him, like some sort of a landgoing octopus?"</p>
<p><b>Alan</b>: "Watch each handshake. Look how it works."</p>
<p><b>Aryk</b>: "Heh... yeah, okay."</p>
<p><b>Eleanora</b>: (Maybe Arretia can come along?)</p>
<p><b>Alan</b>: The dwarf is entering late middle age; he's even grown the long braided beard most city dwarves consider declase.</p>
<p><b>Alan</b>: As you watch, you realize that everyone is making a specific effort to walk past him and shake his hand.</p>
<p><b>Alan</b>: He just happens to be really good at accomodating each person's greeting.</p>
<p><b>Alan</b>: "That's Master Tanager. He's the great-granddaddy of the scene. Sponsors new acts, runs a club."</p>
<p><b>Alan</b>: "Produces people he considers worthy."</p>
<p><b>Aryk</b>: "Hmmm... I've heard that name before..."</p>
<p><b>Alan</b>: "You probably have. He's a big wheel, he just doesn't show it much."</p>
<p><b>Alan</b>: "He's head of the judges' panel."</p>
<p><b>Aryk</b>: "Should I like.. go shake his hand too?"</p>
<p><b>Alan</b>: "Can't hurt to get introduced to him, but it won't help either."</p>
<p><b>Alan</b>: "I'd say, make him come to you."</p>
<p><b>Aryk</b>: "Ah... well, fuck it then."</p>
<p><b>Aryk</b>: "If he's up on his current events he may have already heard of me.  He just probably doesn't know I rap."</p>
<p><b>Alan</b>: "And that lady over there, with the wineglass, is Eleanora Adriatus. She's legendary. She pretty much invented rap music, before the Eastlands thing ever hit."</p>
<p><b>Aryk</b>: "Wow... really?"</p>
<p><b>Alan</b>: "She was doing street poetry six years before I was born."</p>
<p><b>Alan</b>: "Ahem, I mean, two."</p>
<p><b>Aryk</b>: "Yeah, okay, Arretia."</p>
<p><b>Alan</b>: "The Eastlands made it all be about death and money, but any social conscience it has comes from her movement."</p>
<p><b>Alan</b>: "I think she's judging too."</p>
<p><b>Alan</b>: The audience has had time to look you two over, also; some of them may have recognized you, but everyone is playing is cool.</p>
<p><b>Aryk</b>: "Well, that's good.  I'd like to think I'm one of the few rappers that actually has a message."</p>
<p><b>Alan</b>: Except one, a young half-elf with a pen and a pad, who weaves through the mingling crowd and bows before you.</p>
<p><b>Alan</b>: "Sir Aryk Lazarus? Is it really you?"</p>
<p>** Aryk gives the occasional universal nod for "what's up?" **</p>
<p><b>Aryk</b>: "Uh... yeah... What's up?"</p>
<p><b>Alan</b>: "I'm Hake Donnell, Xanadu <i>Telegraph</i> music correspondent. I'm here... well, I'm on the trail of a much bigger story, but I'm covering this competition while I'm at it."</p>
<p><b>Alan</b>: "Are you competing?"</p>
<p><b>Aryk</b>: "Yeah, that's right."</p>
<p><b>Eleanora</b>: "ARRETIA!" The ex-washerwoman certainly knows how to make herself heard. "Get on over here, child, and say hello proper. That skinflint you workin' for give you your one day off a year or somethin'?"</p>
<p><b>Alan</b>: "Oh, wow!" Arretia says. "She came to Lambard's, like, twice! I can't believe she... okay, I'll be back!"</p>
<p><b>Alan</b>: Arretia rushes over to Eleanora.</p>
<p><b>Aryk</b>: "Sure thing... hey put in a good word for... hey!"</p>
<p><b>Alan</b>: "So, huh, you're a rapper as well as a paladin? That's an awesome piece of human interest for the column!"</p>
<p><b>Aryk</b>: "It is?  I mean... yeah, cool.  Well, I'm a paladin first, you know.  But rhyming is a good way to spread a message, you know?  There's a lot of things I.... want to get off my chest."</p>
<p><b>Alan</b>: "Do you think I could ask you a few questions? I can't guarantee that everything will make it into the column about this concert, but maybe I could do a special, just on you?"</p>
<p><i>whispering to Aryk,  yes! yes! say yes!</i> </p>
<p><b>Alan</b>: "You're big news. I'd have to run it by the editor, of course, but I think people would be really interested in hearing what you have to say."</p>
<p><b>Aryk</b>: "Really?  Yeah.... sho thang."</p>
<p><i>whispering to Aryk,  WOO HOO! Bully pulpit!</i> </p>
<p><i><b>Aryk</b> (whispering): This is a double-edged sword though.  I meant it when I said Aryk isn't going to hold anything back.  I hope Renate will be ready to deal with some repercussions when the group hooks back up.</i></p>
<p><i>whispering to Aryk,  Go for it. She'll deal.</i> </p>
<p><b>Alan</b>: (Okay, to make a long story short, he asks a bunch of questions, drawing out the story of how you first started rapping, during that Kahanite scavenger hunt.)</p>
<p><i>whispering to Aryk,  She admires honesty in the face of extreme peril. :)</i> </p>
<p><b>Aryk</b>: (And him being an big Slab fan and stashing their albums in his room at school)</p>
<p><b>Eleanora</b>: (But does he get the story on the custard incident?)</p>
<p><b>Alan</b>: (Nobody does.)</p>
<p><b>Aryk</b>: (Heh, nope)</p>
<p><b>Alan</b>: "Wow, this is a lot of great material," he says. He's filled his page with some sort of arcane shorthand.</p>
<p><b>Eleanora</b>: (Okay, one of you two is SO going to write this up. I wanna read it.)</p>
<p><b>Alan</b>: "Once I'm done with this Durai story, maybe I can look you up?"</p>
<p><b>Aryk</b>: "Sure you can... Durai story?!"</p>
<p><i><b>Aryk</b> (whispering): Hmmm.... yeah, maybe I will.</i></p>
<p><i>whispering to Aryk,  Cool. :)</i> </p>
<p><b>Alan</b>: "Yeah, there's this renegade bard who's been going around... it's hard to get solid facts, but I have a hunch she's using her bardic gift for criminal purposes."</p>
<p><i>whispering to Aryk,  Hook him up with Renate!</i> </p>
<p><b>Alan</b>: "If I can get hard facts, I can blow the story open, maybe even hit the establishment for letting her walk around free."</p>
<p><b>Aryk</b>: "If she has any common sense, she won't be doing that anytime soon.  Let's leave it at that.  If you want more info, without talking to Durai herself, seek out Renate Von Adler."</p>
<p><b>Alan</b>: "Common sense? Did... something happen?"</p>
<p><b>Alan</b>: "Do you know where she is? I've been looking for her."</p>
<p>Alabaster Sunshine (exit): 19:47</p>
<p><b>Aryk</b>: "She's probably in hiding.  I had a talking to with her.  I told her I didn't approve of what she's been doing."</p>
<p><b>Aryk</b>: "You probably won't find her anywhere on the Silver Coast.  At least, she had better not be."</p>
<p><b>Eleanora</b>: (Renate or Dorothy????)</p>
<p><b>Alan</b>: "Huh... this is good, too. Can I get some details? I know some Church types who have been tracking her, too, I could probably pass word to them."</p>
<p><b>Alan</b>: (Dorothy.)</p>
<p><b>Eleanora</b>: (Oh good. Because if it gets into the papers that Renate von Adler is on the run... *shudder*)</p>
<p><b>Alan</b>: "You've heard of Two-Finger Taddak and the Silver Blades? He was just in Emerick, trying to catch her trail, but it's cold."</p>
<p><b>Alan</b>: Two-Finger Taddak is a famous paladin of Michael.</p>
<p><b>Alan</b>: "I was there for the Seventh Moon Festival."</p>
<p><b>Aryk</b>: "Huh... really?  Wow.  Ah.... screw it.  Alright then."  Aryk tells him everything, from the verbal agreement with he and Hermit, to the encounter with Dorothy.  He leaves Emily out of the whole thing though.</p>
<p><b>Alan</b>: Hake scribbles it all down, making noises of wonder and/or surprise where relevant.</p>
<p><b>Alan</b>: "Man, that's pretty impressive. I know I wouldn't mess with you! Let's hope she doesn't."</p>
<p><b>Aryk</b>: "My opinion, she's not an evil person.  She just has issues."</p>
<p><b>Alan</b>: He adjusts his collar, which makes a slight clicking noise. "Yeah, I know what you mean. But that's no excuse!"</p>
<p><b>Aryk</b>: "No, it's not.</p>
<p><b>Alan</b>: "This'll help my report a lot. I'll go check around the border, see if anyone saw her double back."</p>
<p><b>Aryk</b>: "Glad I could help out."</p>
<p><b>Alan</b>: "And I'll catch you when I catch you, Sir Aryk!"</p>
<p><b>Aryk</b>: "Later, dude."</p>
<p><b>Alan</b>: The reporter waves and makes his way out of the dojo.</p>
<p><b>Alan</b>: Arretia is waving for you to come over.</p>
<p>** Aryk meanders over to Arretia and Eleanora. **</p>
<p><b>Eleanora</b>: "So. What's your name, boy?" Eleanora has one meaty arm around Arretia's shoulders, protectively.</p>
<p><b>Aryk</b>: "Aryk.  Aryk Lazarus.  It's my priveledge to meet you, Mz. Eleanora."  Aryk bows his head.</p>
<p><b>Aryk</b>: "And I'm not trying to suck up to you in any way just 'cuz you're a judge."</p>
<p><b>Eleanora</b>: "Damn straight it is," she hits back, and the bar erupts in laughter.</p>
<p>** Aryk smiles, albeit a bit nervously. **</p>
<p><b>Eleanora</b>: "You better not be. Just like you better not be messin' 'round with Arretia like she was some kind of gimmick."</p>
<p><b>Alan</b>: Hadley Domingo wanders past with a clipboard. "Is this do-gooder bothering you, Ellie?"</p>
<p><b>Alan</b>: Arretia points at the clipboard, mouthing "sign up!" at Aryk.</p>
<p><b>Eleanora</b>: "No, now you leave be. He's polite, for a tool."</p>
<p><b>Aryk</b>: "No, ma'am.  I appreciate her talents.  Without her, I couldn't be here."</p>
<p><b>Alan</b>: Hadley guffaws. "A quick wit! Unusual in a paladin!"</p>
<p><b>Aryk</b>: "A... tool?"  Aryk signs up.  "Thank you, Mr. Domingo sir."</p>
<p>** Eleanora nods, slowly and judiciously. **</p>
<p><b>Alan</b>: "Wait, thought you were talking about Ellie. Never mind, I'll reserve judgment."</p>
<p><b>Eleanora</b>: "Shut up, Domingo," she says, without anger.</p>
<p>** Aryk gives Domingo a nervous smile too. **</p>
<p><b>Alan</b>: "Wait a second..." he glances at the clipboard. "Lazarus, Aryk Sir?"</p>
<p>** Eleanora gives him an annoyed look. **</p>
<p><b>Aryk</b>: "Um... yeah, that's right.  It's okay, isn't it?"</p>
<p><b>Eleanora</b>: "Blind, deaf, stupid, or all three, Domingo?"</p>
<p><b>Alan</b>: "Great, a paladin on the pickup. That's pretty wild. I think people will dig it."</p>
<p><b>Aryk</b>: "Heh, I hope so."</p>
<p><b>Alan</b>: He makes a tick-mark, counting Aryk present.</p>
<p><b>Alan</b>: "Your silver's already in the bank. Good luck, kid."</p>
<p><b>Aryk</b>: "Thanks."</p>
<p>** Eleanora raises her eyebrows. **</p>
<p>** Aryk nods respectively. **</p>
<p><b>Eleanora</b>: "Don't you be countin' on that, now."</p>
<p><b>Aryk</b>: "No, ma'am.  Confidentially, I think I'm gonna get my ass kicked in this competition.  But I'll give it all I have anyway."</p>
<p><b>Alan</b>: "Hah!" Hadley says. "I meant it's already in <i>our</i> bank."</p>
<p><b>Eleanora</b>: "And we all know that's what counts, right, Domingo?" Eleanora says wearily. "Money, money, and never mind what it's goin' to."</p>
<p><b>Alan</b>: "Hey, I'm about to signal a start to the festivities. You can debate philosophy later, but right now all I need is rap in, numbers out."</p>
<p><b>Eleanora</b>: "Fine, get out of my face, then." She says confidentially to Aryk and Arretia, "Never did like that man."</p>
<p><b>Eleanora</b>: "And you two go show me somethin' special."</p>
<p><b>Eleanora</b>: She comes within an inch of crushing Arretia's ribcage before she lets the girl go.</p>
<p><b>Alan</b>: Hadley walks away and talks to a brown-skinned hobgoblin woman with coppery hair, who claps him on the back and runs up onto the stage.</p>
<p><b>Aryk</b>: "Thanks.  Arretia, I'll be back in a sec."</p>
<p><b>Alan</b>: "Ladies and motherfuckin' <i>gentlemen!</i> Gets yo hands in the <i>air</i>, don't just stand and <i>stare!</i>"</p>
<p>** Aryk walks to the back of the place, where he can get something close to quiet, and prays. **</p>
<p><b>Alan</b>: "Any o' y'all just lumpin' around like a baked potato, you'se about to rocked like the eye of a tornado!"</p>
<p><b>Aryk</b>: ("Lord Michael, I won't be selfish and ask that you see me through to victory today, but only that you give me strength.")</p>
<p><b>Alan</b>: "I'm Iron Telomere, you know my style, Breadwinners crew, and I'm running this show today."</p>
<p><b>Eleanora</b>: (there's a genetics joke in there somewhere, but I think I'll spare you)</p>
<p><b>Alan</b>: Her voice is deep even for a hobgoblin, a natural baritone if you've ever heard one.</p>
<p><b>Alan</b>: (Yeah, the concept of a "cryptarch," the encrypted archive of information in which our bodies are written, is fairly common knowledge.)</p>
<p><b>Alan</b>: (The actual word "telomere" had to come from some arcane reading, though.)</p>
<p><b>Eleanora</b>: (Mildly dangerous name to use, I'm sure, what with dragon control of knowledge.)</p>
<p><b>Alan</b>: "Here's what the rules are, and it's simple as can be. We've got thirty competitors! That means we have a qualifying round, after which half of you are going home sobbing."</p>
<p><b>Alan</b>: "The highest single scorer of that round gets a bye for round two, when the other fourteen of you duke it out."</p>
<p><b>Alan</b>: "Then the last eight have one more elimination round, then we break until the evening."</p>
<p><b>Alan</b>: "So for these first three rounds, each individual battle is short! Each rapper gets a two-minute timer to spit his best!"</p>
<p><b>Alan</b>: "After each two rappers, the judges score each one. One rapper stays, one rapper pays!"</p>
<p><b>Alan</b>: "Then it's on to the next match. You'd better be ready when you're called on deck, or you're DQed!"</p>
<p><b>Alan</b>: "We have five judges! The high and low scores are tossed out each time, and the other three are added together for your total."</p>
<p><b>Alan</b>: "If you go over time, you're cut off. Period! Just end that line and shut up."</p>
<p><b>Alan</b>: "If you keep rapping, which I know none of you will do, you're out."</p>
<p>** Aryk has barely even been listening.  He finishes praying and stands, takes a deep breath, and rejoins the crowd with Arretia. **</p>
<p><b>Alan</b>: "You can get in your opponent's face, but if you touch him, you're out. No violence of any kind!"</p>
<p><b>Alan</b>: "You can kill each other in the alley afterward, we don't care."</p>
<p><b>Eleanora</b>: "Yes we damn well do!" Eleanora yells.</p>
<p><b>Alan</b>: "Okay, <i>I</i> don't care."</p>
<p><b>Aryk</b>: (Is Saladin Tocaro here by chance?  The one from Club Apocalypse?)</p>
<p><b>Eleanora</b>: "Don't y'all <i>make</i> me put no hurt on you!"</p>
<p><b>Alan</b>: The audience is laughing at the byplay.</p>
<p><b>Alan</b>: "Hey, I got no health insurance, Eleanora! You gotta go easy on me!"</p>
<p>** Aryk 's too nervous to laugh. **</p>
<p><b>Alan</b>: (You don't see him around.)</p>
<p><b>Alan</b>: (But then, he's short.)</p>
<p><b>Aryk</b>: (Heh)</p>
<p><b>Eleanora</b>: "Yeah, who does? So why you puttin' people in line to need it? Get off that stage, I'm tired of lookin' at your pasty-ass face!"</p>
<p><b>Aryk</b>: "Damn!" Aryk calls out</p>
<p><b>Alan</b>: "Got a show to run first! Let's introduce our judges! First off, the chairman of the panel!"</p>
<p><b>Alan</b>: "The Father of Funk, Master Tanager!"</p>
<p>** Eleanora applauds loudly. **</p>
<p><b>Alan</b>: The dwarf mounts the stage, raises a hand to the applause, and sits in the center of the five chairs.</p>
<p>** Aryk claps **</p>
<p><b>Alan</b>: "A woman who needs no introduction, Eleanora Adriatus!"</p>
<p><b>Alan</b>: "Our conscience whether we want one or not!"</p>
<p>** Aryk claps louder **</p>
<p>** Eleanora slides off her barstool and glides her fat shape through the crowd to the stage, taking the next seat over. **</p>
<p><b>Alan</b>: "Last year's winner, sadly sidelined by laryngitis, Tarno 'The Phalanx' Thraddash!"</p>
<p><b>Eleanora</b>: "I know what <i>you</i> want, and the answer's still no!"</p>
<p>** Aryk claps a little bit **</p>
<p>** Eleanora seats Tarno with motherly concern, shaking her head over his temporary disability. **</p>
<p><b>Alan</b>: A half-elf with oddly mottled skin, perhaps from a burn, takes the stage and sits down. His tattoos seem to betray some gang affiliation, but Aryk doesn't know the specifics.</p>
<p><b>Alan</b>: He gives Eleanora a hug.</p>
<p><b>Alan</b>: "Trenton Lakhat, commander of the Golden Vultures!"</p>
<p><b>Alan</b>: A permanently-scowling mercenary stalks onto the stage, dressed in ceremonial war leathers.</p>
<p><b>Alan</b>: He salutes with his dagger, then sits.</p>
<p>** Aryk clap, but less than a little bit **</p>
<p><b>Alan</b>: "And finally, from Xanadu's music scene, the talent scout Damiano Entemann! Do your best to impress this man!"</p>
<p>** Aryk claps a lot on cue **</p>
<p><b>Aryk</b>: (Does he make baked goods one the side?)</p>
<p><b>Eleanora</b>: (Wondering that myself.)</p>
<p><b>Alan</b>: A handsome man with a sleek haircut, ghetto-fab clothing straight from the uptown boutique, and shoes that are far too nice. Clearly a poser, but also clearly confident in himself.</p>
<p><b>Alan</b>: (He's related to Eduardo Keebler. :)</p>
<p><b>Alan</b>: (And Sara "The Destructress" Lee.)</p>
<p>** Eleanora looks him up and down, and makes her opinion known with a slow shake of her head. Nothing needs to be said aloud. **</p>
<p><b>Aryk</b>: (LOL)</p>
<p><b>Alan</b>: "Okay, now settle down! We're going to get this show on the road right now! Say hi to our roadies, Sturm and Kade. Their job is to drop light rigs off one side of the stage and pull them up the other. If your rig is non-standard, you have thirty seconds to plug it all in or you're out. If it's standard, let them do it."</p>
<p><b>Eleanora</b>: "Hey, Sturm! Hey Kade!" Eleanora obliges.</p>
<p><b>Alan</b>: Arretia says, "Don't worry, ours is okay. I got my ex to carry it in."</p>
<p><b>Alan</b>: She points to a dopey-looking young man, you hope no older than sixteen, who is holding one end of a wheeled footlocker.</p>
<p><b>Aryk</b>: "Aight, cool"</p>
<p><b>Alan</b>: Iron Telomere announces the first match: "Jameson Talisker, with Lightwarrior Vintae Taem, against Saladin Tocaro... who is competing with the deadly dwarven beat engine, Nakath Artreigh!"</p>
<p>** Aryk stands up **</p>
<p><b>Aryk</b>: "Saladin!  You go, my short-ass lil' brother!"</p>
<p><b>Alan</b>: Saladin Tocaro leaps onto the stage in a single bound, then pulls another dwarf up next to him; on the other side, a two young humans hurry to get their gear to Sturm and Kade, who spring into action connecting magical apparatus.</p>
<p><b>Aryk</b>: (Aryk actually respects Tocaro a lot after the club battle.)</p>
<p><b>Alan</b>: The battle, when Telomere drops her hand, is about five minutes, allowing for a pause between raps. It's horribly one-sided.</p>
<p><b>Alan</b>: Young Talisker has a polished voice and delivery, but can't think fast enough to come up with good rhymes; he ends up dropping into a slow rhythm and using simple schemes.</p>
<p><b>Alan</b>: Tocaro, accompanied on another microphone by his beat-boxer, destroys him with searing lyrics.</p>
<p><b>Aryk</b>: (Now they're not giving random subjects to rap about then, are they?  It's just a whatever-you-want sort of thing?)</p>
<p><b>Alan</b>: The audience particularly responds to the beat-boxing; it's a do-it-yourself style that has innate emotional appeal, and the dwarf is pretty good, too.</p>
<p><b>Alan</b>: (Ah, yes they are, thanks, I almost forgot.)</p>
<p><b>Aryk</b>: (Yeah, he was!)</p>
<p><b>Alan</b>: (I would have remembered when your turn came up, at least.)</p>
<p><b>Alan</b>: (This time, the theme was "tranquility." Tocaro rapped about how no such thing can ever exist. :)</p>
<p><b>Aryk</b>: (I should have kept my mouth shut.  I could have just cut-and-pasted a pre-written song!)</p>
<p>** Eleanora pulls no punches on the scores, but she saves a smile for the crestfallen loser nonetheless. **</p>
<p><b>Alan</b>: (Well, I don't have any specific words in mind, and definitely haven't prepared, so either we'll get Dorothea to suggest one each time, or I'll pull one out of thin air and deal with it.)</p>
<p><b>Eleanora</b>: (Since part of the point here is to encourage people to keep on going.)</p>
<p><b>Alan</b>: (Brb, bathroom.)</p>
<p><b>Eleanora</b>: (David's reading over my shoulder, so maybe I'll have HIM suggest the topics.)</p>
<p><b>Aryk</b>: (Hi David!)</p>
<p><b>Eleanora</b>: (David says hi.)</p>
<p><b>Alan</b>: (Back. And hi!)</p>
<p><b>Eleanora</b>: (I've given him paper and pencil to write down whatever he can think of.)</p>
<p><b>Alan</b>: Winner and loser both wander into the crowd. Saladin Tocaro heads straight for Aryk. "The Super-Tight Michaelite, huh? Decided to go pro?"</p>
<p><b>Alan</b>: You noticed Jameson Talisker following.</p>
<p><b>Alan</b>: Iron Telomere announces the next match, and who's on deck; Aryk is still a ways away, apparently.</p>
<p><b>Aryk</b>: "Well, I just want to say some things, you know.  I don't want to make a career out of this shit.  I just want to prove myself.  Hey, you were real tight, man.  Good ups."</p>
<p><b>Alan</b>: "Thanks. I'm looking forward to seeing what you do. You were pretty raw last time I saw you. You can't squeak by on novelty with these judges."</p>
<p><b>Alan</b>: Jameson Talisker comes up. "Hey, Saladin, I just want to congratulate you! That was amazing!"</p>
<p><b>Alan</b>: "I thought I knew about rap, but all my classes were just teaching me shit I didn't need to know, I guess."</p>
<p><b>Alan</b>: Saladin laughs. "You took <i>classes</i>?"</p>
<p>** Aryk laughs too **</p>
<p><b>Aryk</b>: "Yo, that's pretty whack, dude."</p>
<p><b>Alan</b>: "Yeah! You know... 'Urban Psychology in Stave Lyrics,' 'Musical Styles of the Disenfranchised...'"</p>
<p><b>Alan</b>: Saladin slaps his knee. "Well ram a pig up my ass and call me a blanket!"</p>
<p><b>Alan</b>: Arretia stares at Saladin. "Whoa."</p>
<p><b>Alan</b>: "That's <i>good</i>."</p>
<p><b>Aryk</b>: "Dude... you're small... you better settle for a gerbil."</p>
<p><b>Aryk</b>: "Even then, it would take a lot of lube."</p>
<p><b>Alan</b>: Saladin stares at Aryk, in turn. "Shut."</p>
<p><b>Alan</b>: "Also, up."</p>
<p><b>Eleanora</b>: (I am an evil twisted person. I totally saw that coming.)</p>
<p><b>Aryk</b>: "What?"</p>
<p><b>Eleanora</b>: (So to speak.)</p>
<p><b>Alan</b>: (You too.)</p>
<p>** Aryk 's problem is his often too naive to get the humor **</p>
<p><b>Alan</b>: Jameson shakes his head violently. "Well, anyway, this is my chance to see something real, I guess. Man! Dark Rinaldi told me this was where to go, but I had no idea."</p>
<p><b>Alan</b>: Saladin does a double-take. "You know <i>Dark Rinaldi</i>? I thought he didn't have any friends whose criminal record was shorter than the Book of Deeds."</p>
<p><b>Aryk</b>: "Hey, Saladin, which one of these motherfuckers is Skullfucker?"</p>
<p><b>Alan</b>: "Yeah, my older brother was his lawyer when he was up for murder."</p>
<p><b>Alan</b>: "Which <i>time</i>?" Saladin laughs at Jameson.</p>
<p><b>Alan</b>: "Skullstriker? He's... huh, I don't see him."</p>
<p><b>Alan</b>: "he's probably planning a big entrance."</p>
<p><b>Aryk</b>: "Let's hope he didn't show."</p>
<p><b>Alan</b>: A winner wins; a loser loses; the next match is called on stage.</p>
<p><b>Alan</b>: "So what's Rinaldi up to these days?" Saladin asks.</p>
<p><b>Alan</b>: "I don't know. He's got his nose in some sort of influence thing, I think. Pulling strings, now that everyone respects him, or at least fears him."</p>
<p><b>Alan</b>: "I don't ask him much. We mostly talk about music. He relaxes by jamming with my buds."</p>
<p><b>Aryk</b>: "That's fascinating.  Shut up, I'm trying to hear who gets called next, dammit!"</p>
<p><b>Alan</b>: "Yeah, I wanna hear this," Saladin says.</p>
<p><b>Alan</b>: The matches proceed at a quick pace; some of the talent is really impressive, some is weak.</p>
<p><b>Alan</b>: A rapper called "Weregild" is particularly impressive; he has a disjointed Eastlands style that defies all laws of rhythm to somehow click.</p>
<p><b>Eleanora</b>: (Nice name.)</p>
<p><b>Alan</b>: There's also a female rapper, as much a rarity as a female lightwarrior, named Ariel Blackhand. Saladin explains that she's an assassin, wanted dead in seven countries.</p>
<p><b>Aryk</b>: "Damn.  That was tight."  Aryk's stomach cries out.</p>
<p><b>Alan</b>: She swung diplomatic shelter in the Silver Coast by pulling some strings.</p>
<p><b>Eleanora</b>: (Strings? Seven-strand industrial-strength ropes, I should think!)</p>
<p><b>Alan</b>: When Skullstriker is called, there's a long silence, during which Iron Telomere threatens to disqualify him...</p>
<p><b>Alan</b>: ...before she notices that the koi pond is starting to boil.</p>
<p>** Aryk downs more coffee, nearly vibrating from the caffeine at this point **</p>
<p><b>Alan</b>: A hulking hobgoblin explodes out of his lilypad concealment, water steaming off his Polar-Worm-powered frame, tossing his reed breathing tube aside.</p>
<p><b>Alan</b>: "Ready to battle!" he roars.</p>
<p><b>Alan</b>: "Was that cool? I can't quite tell," Saladin says quizzically.</p>
<p><b>Aryk</b>: "What the...?"</p>
<p><b>Alan</b>: "I <i>guess</i> it gets points." He shrugs.</p>
<p><b>Alan</b>: "Original, at least."</p>
<p><b>Aryk</b>: "Skullsmasher's a hobogoblin?!"</p>
<p>** Eleanora is openly, overtly unimpressed. **</p>
<p><b>Eleanora</b>: ("I scoff at your boiling koi!")</p>
<p><b>Aryk</b>: (LOL)</p>
<p><b>Alan</b>: "Yeahp. Atama o Naguru. Literally, 'strike or punch the head.'"</p>
<p><b>Alan</b>: Michio Matatabi, the lost member of Purgatory, sets up a top-of-the-line light rig while Skullstriker flexes his muscles on stage.</p>
<p>** Aryk just stands there with his mouth open **</p>
<p><b>Alan</b>: His hapless competition plays it much cooler, which would work in their favor if Skullstriker didn't turn out to have a ferocious flow which makes his posturing almost plausible.</p>
<p><b>Alan</b>: (Think L.L. Cool J when he's good.)</p>
<p><b>Aryk</b>: (heh)</p>
<p><b>Alan</b>: (Giant asshole, somehow pulls it off.)</p>
<p><b>Eleanora</b>: Eleanora gives him the victory -- but by only one point. It is a warning. It's about the words, not the flash.</p>
<p><b>Eleanora</b>: And respect is part of the scene -- any scene she's in, anyway.</p>
<p><b>Alan</b>: After Skullstriker's win, the next match is a dwarf named Ambrose Thunderhead against a Toy Soldier named Garrioch Damind... and on deck? Aryk Lazarus vs. Miguel "Blackjack" Torvus!</p>
<p><b>Alan</b>: Saladin laughs. "Don't worry about this, Aryk. Looks like they wanted a fun bracket."</p>
<p><b>Alan</b>: "Blackjack's a religious nut, thinks everything's ordained. Hadley obviously put you two together to see who would out-Church who."</p>
<p><b>Alan</b>: "He's a terrible rapper, though. Just be steady."</p>
<p><b>Aryk</b>: "Huh?  Fuck that.  Everyone's in for a shock when I take the pickup."</p>
<p>** Aryk looks genuinely dissed. **</p>
<p><b>Alan</b>: The dwarf ends up winning, with an angry diatribe about the power of the rich which only occasionally relates to the chosen word.</p>
<p><b>Alan</b>: (Just how much the word has to be referenced is a judgment call. If a rapper crafts his entire rap around it, that's ideal.)</p>
<p><b>Alan</b>: (If a rapper suddenly seems more at ease when he's spitting lines that don't have to do with the word, it's a pretty good sign he's going on memory.)</p>
<p><b>Aryk</b>: (Got it)</p>
<p><b>Alan</b>: At last, Aryk and Torvus are called to the stage! Arretia's ex-boyfriend hauls the locker over and opens it; Sturm and Kade install it in place almost instantly.</p>
<p><b>Alan</b>: Blackjack's lightwarrior is content to use the house equipment.</p>
<p>** Aryk has his eyes closed for a moment, and his lips are moving.  He takes a deep breath and stands, then takes the stage. **</p>
<p><b>Aryk</b>: (One final prayer can't hurt)</p>
<p><b>Alan</b>: "Okay, you wily young scamps," Iron Telomere growls, "the word is..." she rustles around in the black felt bag, "Death! Creeeepy!"</p>
<p><b>Alan</b>: "Aryk, call it!" She flips a coin in the air.</p>
<p><b>Aryk</b>: "Tails!"</p>
<p><b>Alan</b>: [1d2] -> [2] = (2)</p>
<p><b>Alan</b>: "You win! Choose whether to go first or second."</p>
<p><b>Aryk</b>: "Second, for sure!</p>
<p><b>Alan</b>: (That's probably all the dice we're even going to roll. Yay for D&D!)</p>
<p><b>Aryk</b>: " Aryk chuckles </p>
<p><b>Aryk</b>: Yay!</p>
<p><b>Alan</b>: (In fact, that's all the dice we've rolled in a good month.)</p>
<p><b>Eleanora</b>: (and I'm lovin' it!)</p>
<p><b>Alan</b>: "Okay, Blackjack... the timer starts either ten seconds after your music, or when you start rapping."</p>
<p><b>Alan</b>: "Whenever you're ready."</p>
<p><b>Alan</b>: She leaves out that if he doesn't start in thirty seconds, he's out. Disqualification is quick and brutal.</p>
<p><b>Alan</b>: The lightwarrior almost fumbles the cube in the slot, but manages to start up a simplistic homegrown beat with a well-known hymn layered over it.</p>
<p><b>Alan</b>: "Well, I'm, Blackjack, sent by the heavens to tell you / that if you don't try to worship and stay out of hell you / will end up dead in the ground, and never rise / and never see paradise with your own eyes"</p>
<p><b>Alan</b>: "You'll fall into hell, and that's the way it should be / because you're fooling yourself if you don't pray like me / You'd better go to Church every day like me / Or else you'll, um..."</p>
<p><b>Eleanora</b>: (Oh. Dear.)</p>
<p><b>Alan</b>: "Everything on earth is sacred, never half-, um, bak-ed / but always true, because we are all naked / in the eyes of the divine, we dance for love / and the holy scripture fit our souls like... gloves..."</p>
<p><b>Alan</b>: "I want you to agree..." here he pauses, disconcerted, because the hymn turned into full-blown singing that drowns out his rap. The lightwarrior frantically kills that track, leaving only the beat.</p>
<p><b>Aryk</b>: (LOL)</p>
<p><b>Alan</b>: "I want you to agree that death is not the answer / but it's better than sin, which can spread like a cancer / When we die, we are judged, when we... cry, we are nudged / to recognize that salvation is more delicious than fudge" Not only is this so terrible the audience laughs, but he has to speed up to catch up with the beat.</p>
<p><b>Eleanora</b>: (Two minutes! Two minutes!)</p>
<p><b>Eleanora</b>: (MAKE IT STOP!)</p>
<p><b>Alan</b>: "So in conclusion, I want to remedy confusion / by assuring you that life is just an illusion / but so is death; you may think there's nothing left / but when you reach heaven, it's... you'll not be bereft?"</p>
<p><b>Alan</b>: Iron Telomere has been holding up her bell as the audience chants "ten! Nine! Eight!"</p>
<p><b>Aryk</b>: "Fudge?  Yo, did you just say fudge?"</p>
<p><b>Alan</b>: She rings it the instant they hit zero.</p>
<p><b>Alan</b>: "I know I'm religious now: I thank the angels that's over!"</p>
<p><b>Alan</b>: "Judges!"</p>
<p>** Eleanora gives a "Do I have to?" look at the audience and holds up a two. **</p>
<p><b>Eleanora</b>: One for each minute.</p>
<p><b>Alan</b>: The judges each write their scores on a slate and hold them up. Master Tanager delivers a five, explaining "It takes courage to keep going when you're being laughed at."</p>
<p><b>Alan</b>: Five is the lowest he ever gives, though.</p>
<p><b>Eleanora</b>: "Right on."</p>
<p><b>Alan</b>: Damiano Entemann holds up a six, with a shrug.</p>
<p><b>Alan</b>: Trenton Lakhat, the mercenary captain, hands out a grudging four.</p>
<p><b>Alan</b>: And last year's winner, Tarno Thraddash, gives out a one, shaking his head as if to say "there's no way."</p>
<p><b>Aryk</b>: Me whispers in Blackjack's ear "Stick to the scriptures, homey."</p>
<p><b>Alan</b>: "The total is twelve!"</p>
<p><b>Alan</b>: (And I got it wrong, scoring should be after both people have gone.)</p>
<p>** Eleanora nudges Tarno, with a dark look. Respect. **</p>
<p><b>Eleanora</b>: ('S okay.)</p>
<p><b>Alan</b>: "Okay, Lazarus, your turn! On your mark."</p>
<p><b>Alan</b>: Arretia takes her position at the light rig, spins a cube on one fingertip, glances out at the audience, and immediately fumbles the cube into the koi pond.</p>
<p><b>Alan</b>: "Oh. What. Am I doing here."</p>
<p><b>Alan</b>: She closes her eyes tight, and hunts for another soundcube by feel in her bag.</p>
<p><b>Alan</b>: "Thirty second rule, girl," Iron Telomere says unhelpfully.</p>
<p><b>Eleanora</b>: "Come on, honey," Eleanora says, in what for her is a low voice.</p>
<p><b>Aryk</b>: "Arretia... you know what kind of beats I like... I have faith in you, girl."</p>
<p><b>Alan</b>: Arretia has found a cube, but since she never opened her eyes there's no telling if she even knows what it is.</p>
<p><b>Alan</b>: She slams it into the player, then slaps in two more, and twists the knobs. Horrible static spears through the system, instantly resolving into music as Arretia frantically adjusts the set.</p>
<p><b>Alan</b>: "Okay okay okay okay okay" she mutters. "Do this."</p>
<p><b>Alan</b>: She finds the right settings, and the beat comes in, Just Cause jazz looping over the top.</p>
<p><b>Alan</b>: She mixes the jazz into stabs instead of flows, matching it to the bounce requirements of the style.</p>
<p><b>Alan</b>: "Okay, all you."</p>
<p><b>Aryk</b>: "Yo... yo..." Aryk bobs his head as he lets the beat flow through him.  It doesn't take nearly him any time to kick in with the lyrics, just enough to let the audience get a feel for the beat themselves</p>
<p><b>Aryk</b>: "Now tell me... where will you end up when all's said and done</p>
<p><b>Aryk</b>: "Where is it your destiny lies / When you've had your fun</p>
<p><b>Aryk</b>: Is it eternal torment / Or under the sun</p>
<p><b>Aryk</b>: Nah, the end of an era only / Your life has just begun</p>
<p><b>Aryk</b>: Now I know ya'll expect me to rap about Salvation</p>
<p><b>Aryk</b>: 'Oh, he's a paladin / he'll rap about creation' </p>
<p><b>Aryk</b>: (Aryk uses one of his mock third person voices for that line he hopes he'll become well-known for)</p>
<p><b>Aryk</b>: And the sins of man / Well, FUCK THAT!</p>
<p><b>Alan</b>: (You're playing up the Eminem, I see. :)</p>
<p><b>Aryk</b>: (Oh yes)</p>
<p><b>Aryk</b>: You may be surprised when I rap about some real shit</p>
<p><b>Aryk</b>: I don't want ya'll to live your life by books / I want ya'll to feel shit</p>
<p><b>Aryk</b>: May the churches only guide you / But the angels live inside you</p>
<p><b>Aryk</b>: Let me spit some REAL shit you won't forget</p>
<p><b>Aryk</b>: Death isn't the ending/ it's the beginning of things</p>
<p><b>Aryk</b>: You'll find that the what you did in life comes back to yo</p>
<p><b>Aryk</b>: (You)</p>
<p><b>Aryk</b>: Now let me leave you with a little something</p>
<p><b>Aryk</b>: Death is not to be feared, or embraced, </p>
<p><b>Aryk</b>: but it's something you'll go through</p>
<p><b>Aryk</b>: (Er... time?  Shoud I start another verse?)</p>
<p><b>Alan</b>: Nope, you're set; the two-minute glass is almost empty.</p>
<p><b>Aryk</b>: In that case Aryk we'll just leave it at that.  No point in drawing it out.</p>
<p><b>Alan</b>: Arretia closes it out with a musical hook; a singer saying something in Hobgoblin that you don't understand, followed by a sound clip of some politician saying "And that is the way things are in this world today!"</p>
<p>** Aryk puts the pickup back in place casually **</p>
<p>** Aryk gives an approving nod to Arretia **</p>
<p><b>Alan</b>: Iron Telomere nods her head a few times. "I felt that. Anybody else feel that?" The audience cheers, some half-heartedly.</p>
<p><b>Alan</b>: "Well, what's important is whether the judges felt that!"</p>
<p><b>Alan</b>: Trenton Lakhat holds up a 7, just a point higher than he gave Blackjack. Tin ear, that man.</p>
<p>** Eleanora considers a bit, is not the first to score. **</p>
<p><b>Alan</b>: Tarno Thraddash hands out a 7 as well.</p>
<p><b>Eleanora</b>: She gives it a 6.</p>
<p><b>Alan</b>: Master Tanager gives a 7, saying "Don't get a big head."</p>
<p><b>Alan</b>: "Judging gets harder each round."</p>
<p>** Aryk smiles a little **</p>
<p><b>Alan</b>: "Watch the scores go down."</p>
<p><b>Alan</b>: Damiano Entemann holds up an eight.</p>
<p><b>Alan</b>: "That's a solid 21, then. Not bad... not amazing."</p>
<p>** Aryk nods understandingly.  He wasn't really impressed with himself either, but for now all he had to do was beat Blackjack, in his mind. **</p>
<p><b>Alan</b>: "Okay, next match, get up here!"</p>
<p><b>Aryk</b>: "Col."</p>
<p>** Aryk gets off the stage.  **</p>
<p><b>Aryk</b>: "Yo, Arretia, let me holler at you."</p>
<p><b>Alan</b>: Saladin Tocaro and Jameson Talisker are waiting to congratulate you when you arrive back in the crowd. "Good job out there, not that you had any competition. Hope you don't expect to win with that flow, though," Saladin adds.</p>
<p><b>Alan</b>: Arretia nods. "Yeah, we have to have a meeting of minds," she says to Saladin, leaning in to Aryk.</p>
<p><b>Aryk</b>: "Nah, that was pretty weak.  Don't worry, I got a lot more."</p>
<p><b>Alan</b>: "Oh my stars, I almost blew it! I sucked!"</p>
<p><b>Alan</b>: "What are we going to do, what if I, like, light the rig on fire next time?"</p>
<p><b>Aryk</b>: "Nah, girl, awesome recovery.  Don't worry.  Just... er... don't do it again."</p>
<p><b>Aryk</b>: "You did great.  Especially at the end there.  It's not you I'm worried about."</p>
<p><b>Alan</b>: "Well, if I can hack it, you can hack it."</p>
<p><b>Alan</b>: (I don't know if I'm down for the rest of the tournament, though; let's do the next round, and then do the last three next session.)</p>
<p><b>Aryk</b>: "Heh, I'm glad you are confident in that.  Don't worry, the next round, I'm gonna explode on that motherfucker."</p>
<p><b>Aryk</b>: (Sure.)</p>
<p><b>Aryk</b>: (Yeah, time has really flown by tonight)</p>
<p><b>Alan</b>: You were pretty near the end of the rotation for that round; next round, the matchups are all chosen in random order, although there may still be some favoritism as to who goes against who.</p>
<p><b>Alan</b>: For instance, they won't put two known favorites against each other in an early round.</p>
<p><b>Alan</b>: They want them to keep drawing the audience.</p>
<p><b>Alan</b>: So, unfortunately, people like Skullstriker or Weregild just get to assassinate small fry.</p>
<p>** Eleanora beckons Sturm between rounds, and has him fish Arretia's 'cube out of the pond and return it to her. **</p>
<p><b>Alan</b>: "Oh, thank you!"</p>
<p><b>Alan</b>: Sturm nods gruffly.</p>
<p><b>Alan</b>: The first round ends with "Sir Slade of Demosah" and his lightwarrior&#8212;who is also his faerie guardian&#8212;defeating "Grand Master Ironface" in a close match.</p>
<p><b>Eleanora</b>: (I'm a little surprised at the bye, then. It just puts an audience fave out of action.)</p>
<p><b>Alan</b>: Sir Slade's patron Demosah seems to be a faerie of war and tactics, since his rap was all about the various weaknesses that can lead to defeat.</p>
<p><b>Alan</b>: (He gets to do a solo piece before the quarterfinals.)</p>
<p><b>Eleanora</b>: (Okay.)</p>
<p><b>Alan</b>: There isn't much downtime between rounds; just long enough for Iron Telomere to suggest everyone get drinks and tip their bartender.</p>
<p><b>Alan</b>: As soon as Hadley draws up the next bracket, he hands it to Iron Telomere and she kicks off the round. "Ariel Blackhand and Gem Tagli, to the stage! Aryk Lazarus and Ambrose Thunderhead, on deck!"</p>
<p><b>Alan</b>: "Okay," Arretia says, "we can do this one. He raps about how bad it is to be a miner. I'm sure we can beat that!"</p>
<p><b>Aryk</b>: "Heh... aight."</p>
<p><b>Alan</b>: (Brb, bathroom. Just pretend there's rapping going on. Probably about killing people.)</p>
<p><b>Aryk</b>: (And mining)</p>
<p><b>Eleanora</b>: "Hey, Aryk," Eleanora bellows to him between rounds, "how 'come your girlfriend ain't here?"</p>
<p><b>Aryk</b>: "Huh?"  Aryk looks genuinely shocked.  "My what?"</p>
<p><b>Eleanora</b>: "Your girlfriend, man! Her Ladyship!"</p>
<p><b>Alan</b>: (Back.)</p>
<p><b>Eleanora</b>: "This too low a dive for the likes of her?"</p>
<p><b>Alan</b>: (If it's between rounds, that means Arretia's already setting up.)</p>
<p><b>Aryk</b>: "...Oh, Renate?  Heh, she ain't my girl.  Just a close friend.  Like a sister.  She's off doin' her thing."</p>
<p><b>Eleanora</b>: (well, I was moving back in time a bit, actually)</p>
<p><b>Alan</b>: (Oh, okay.)</p>
<p><b>Alan</b>: (Rounds, not matches.)</p>
<p><b>Eleanora</b>: (yep)</p>
<p><b>Eleanora</b>: "Yeah, well, you show me to her some time. Want to meet her."</p>
<p><b>Aryk</b>: "Will do.  You'll like her.  Everyone who meets her does."</p>
<p><b>Alan</b>: Back in the present&#8212;</p>
<p><b>Eleanora</b>: Eleanora looks skeptical. "We'll see. I got to go, they're pickin' it up."</p>
<p><b>Aryk</b>: (I keep picturing Eleanora as sort of a cross between Mya Angelou and Queen Latifah)</p>
<p><b>Alan</b>: Ariel Blackhand has defeated her opponent with a grisly tale of betrayal and doom (the word, oddly, was "butterfly," and Ariel managed to turn it into a death image.)</p>
<p><b>Aryk</b>: (That's to be expected from a wanted assaassin, I guess)</p>
<p><b>Eleanora</b>: (That's about what I'm going for. Glad to know I'm at least in the ballpark.)</p>
<p><b>Alan</b>: Arretia sets up, with the help of the roadies; the dwarf sets up opposite, along with a dwarven drummer.</p>
<p><b>Alan</b>: "The word for this match is..." Iron Telomere hunts around in her bag. "...bunnies! Bunnies?"</p>
<p><b>Alan</b>: "Dammit, Hadley!"</p>
<p><b>Alan</b>: Hadley shrugs. "They're all audience suggestions!"</p>
<p><b>Aryk</b>: "Bunnies?!  BUNNIES?!  HOW CAN I RAP ABOUT BUNNIES?!"</p>
<p><b>Alan</b>: The audience is laughing, wondering what the contestants are going to make of it.</p>
<p><b>Alan</b>: Ambrose Thunderhead stares at the ceiling, then says "Hm. I know."</p>
<p><b>Eleanora</b>: (You can kick David's ass when you move to Wisconsin, Matt. I give you a free innings.)</p>
<p><b>Alan</b>: "Well, call it, Thunderhead."</p>
<p><b>Alan</b>: She flips. "I call heads!" the dwarf cries.</p>
<p><b>Alan</b>: [1d2] -> [1] = (1)</p>
<p><b>Alan</b>: "And I'll go second. If you're so flummoxed, paladin, I won't let you have time to think about it!"</p>
<p><b>Alan</b>: "Okay then," Telomere laughs. "Bunnies! Whenever you're ready!"</p>
<p><b>Alan</b>: Arretia giggles to herself. "What do you want, Aryk? Dark or light?"</p>
<p><b>Aryk</b>: "Light.  Overly light."</p>
<p><b>Alan</b>: "You'll get both."</p>
<p><b>Aryk</b>: "Ridiculously, light, even."</p>
<p><b>Eleanora</b>: ("Li'l bunny Froo-Froo...")</p>
<p><b>Alan</b>: She pops two soundcubes in and starts playing one... "Little bunny foo-foo was hopping through the forest..."</p>
<p><b>Alan</b>: (Jinx!)</p>
<p><b>Aryk</b>: What the fuck, man!!</p>
<p><b>Aryk</b>: Okay, here we go.</p>
<p><b>Alan</b>: She instantly slams the fader to a post-Slab rage band. "DEAAAATH! DEEAAAATH!"</p>
<p><b>Alan</b>: The fader again: "pickin' up the fieldmice and boppin' em on the" "DEAAAATH!"</p>
<p>** Aryk shakes his head, and then begins to feel the beat regardless **</p>
<p><b>Alan</b>: Then she drops the beat, leaving the bunny tune over the top.</p>
<p>** Eleanora is laughing herself to tears in the judges' row. **</p>
<p><b>Aryk</b>: "Fluffy bunnies, fluffy bunnies / The world is full of fluffy bunnies</p>
<p><b>Aryk</b>: "That's people living happily / Finding dragon tyranny so funny</p>
<p><b>Aryk</b>: "That's idiots spending frivolously / wasting all that hard earned money</p>
<p><b>Aryk</b>: "Just to make their lives seem calm / at ease / what else do you want from me?</p>
<p><b>Aryk</b>: Why is it people live selfishly / ignorant of the blood-stained truth</p>
<p><b>Aryk</b>: While you work your fuckin' nine-to-five / dragons make decisions for you</p>
<p><b>Aryk</b>: While you go home / Kiss your wife and kids/ Dark Eternal pretends to emplore you</p>
<p><b>Aryk</b>: When honestly he don't give a fuck / But you think that he adores you</p>
<p><b>Aryk</b>: Nations will collide / Do you think that Heaven will ignore you?</p>
<p><b>Aryk</b>: Honestly, it makes me sick / To see good people act so dumb</p>
<p><b>Aryk</b>: When demons, dragons, crime syndicates have you under their thumb?</p>
<p><b>Aryk</b>: It's time for a change/ the system to be rearranged</p>
<p><i>whispering to Aryk,  don't forget to bring the bunnies back in!</i> </p>
<p><b>Aryk</b>: You're little Jack Horner/ go fuckin' eat your plumbs</p>
<p><b>Aryk</b>: So prance around and dance around and eat up all your greens</p>
<p><b>Aryk</b>: You're all just little fuckin' bunnies, man / Now it don't sound so obsene</p>
<p><i>whispering to Aryk,  bra-fucking-VO, man!</i> </p>
<p><b>Aryk</b>: When you leave tonight / in a state of fright / you'll know just what I mean</p>
<p><b>Alan</b>: Arretia has been shifting the beat darker and darker as you go along, fading the bunny song out.</p>
<p><b>Alan</b>: But now she concludes by snapping it back in: "Now I'm going to give you <i>one... more... chance....</i>"</p>
<p><b>Alan</b>: And the bell rings.</p>
<p><b>Alan</b>: Okay, this time we'll remember to judge after both contestants.</p>
<p><b>Eleanora</b>: (Yep. Waitin'.)</p>
<p><b>Aryk</b>: "That's my word!"  He winks at Saladin and slams the pickup back into it's holster.</p>
<p><b>Alan</b>: The audience goes wild. They love raps about bunnies!</p>
<p><b>Alan</b>: "I think I'm slowly going insane," Iron Telomere says. "Okay, Ambrose Thunderhead, bring it back."</p>
<p><b>Alan</b>: Ambrose signals to his drummer, who starts up a beat.</p>
<p><b>Eleanora</b>: ("Coal Miner's Bunny")</p>
<p>** Aryk plops down in his seat.  He has now idea how he was able to rap about bunnies.  He can't even remember what he said. **</p>
<p><b>Alan</b>: "When I pick up my pick-axe, flak flies from rocks / when I swing my mattock, cracks spread in locks / when you jackrabbit out of your cave, I'm taking over the rave like pirate radicals blockade the docks!"</p>
<p><b>Alan</b>: "You're a hare, a lop-eared, cotton-tailed disgrace / When I get up in the spot, I'll put you back in your place / When you step up to the hill, I'll shoot you down with my bow / You'd better learn which warren-holes are safe to go!"</p>
<p><b>Alan</b>: "So listen up: I'm straight Ithaca style / and when if you pick up an inch, I'm going to pick up a mile, we're talking old style / none of these Dragon's Reign kilometers / we're more hardcore than lodestone barometers"</p>
<p><b>Aryk</b>: "Wow... that's not bad."  Aryk looks a bit concerned for his own welfare.</p>
<p><b>Alan</b>: "I'm an uncut stone that bears weight / I'm on a throne of bones of those who battled fate / and lost, but I never wear county blues, I floss / soot stains and coal dust / you can never control us!"</p>
<p><b>Aryk</b>: Aryk whispers to Arretia and Saladin, "I wish I hadn't gone first this time... he's feeding off me."</p>
<p><b>Alan</b>: "Don't bunny-hop; you can't dodge my fletchery / you're not a pimp-dad; you're just a master of lechery / you can't hang against dwarves, you're not that tall / and when I kick for the goal, keep your eye on the ball!"</p>
<p><b>Alan</b>: The dwarf stands down with a satisfied smirk.</p>
<p>** Aryk gives Thunderhead a respective nod. **</p>
<p><b>Alan</b>: Iron Telomere says, "Let it be on the record that he used five of those phrases in the battle at Conroy's on Woodson Street two months ago. You know the rules."</p>
<p><b>Eleanora</b>: (I <i>thought</i> that might be the case.)</p>
<p><b>Alan</b>: A certain amount of repetition is allowed; after all, there are only so many rhymes, period. But if someone actually has you made, you lose a point for every two self-bites.</p>
<p><b>Alan</b>: As a rough estimate.</p>
<p>** Aryk suddenly feels a glint of hope **</p>
<p><b>Alan</b>: "For the record, he adapted a few of them to the random word," Tarno Thraddash whispers.</p>
<p><b>Alan</b>: "But yeah."</p>
<p><b>Alan</b>: "Okay then," Telomere says. "Let's score! Aryk first."</p>
<p><b>Eleanora</b>: "Yeah, so shit, replacin' one word..." Eleanora mutters back. "I expected better of that boy, I really did."</p>
<p>** Aryk closes his eyes **</p>
<p><b>Eleanora</b>: Eleanora scribbles quickly, thrusts a 9 defiantly into the air.</p>
<p><b>Eleanora</b>: Eleanora doesn't give 10s.</p>
<p>** Aryk clasps Arretia's hand.  He doesn't look.  He only wants to hear the final score. **</p>
<p><b>Eleanora</b>: She believes there's always room for improvement.</p>
<p><b>Alan</b>: Tarno Thraddash gives Aryk a 7. "Always harder second round," he whispers.</p>
<p><b>Alan</b>: Master Tanager impartially offers an 8. "I like bunnies, too."</p>
<p><b>Aryk</b>: (LOL)</p>
<p><b>Alan</b>: From Damiano Entemann, a 7; from Trenton Lakhat, an 8.</p>
<p><b>Alan</b>: "Lot of heart," Trenton explains.</p>
<p><b>Aryk</b>: (WOOHOO!  I can live with that)</p>
<p><b>Alan</b>: "So the total is 23, seven points shy of a perfect score. From this crowd, not bad!"</p>
<p><b>Alan</b>: "Now to judge Ambrose Thunderhead. Judges?"</p>
<p>** Aryk hugs Arretia **</p>
<p><b>Alan</b>: Master Tanager offers another 8. "Excellent rhymes. Now get a message."</p>
<p><b>Aryk</b>: "No matter what happens, Arretia, you were great."</p>
<p><b>Eleanora</b>: Eleanora shakes her head, offers a 5.</p>
<p><b>Alan</b>: Trenton gives a 6. "I didn't feel anything."</p>
<p><b>Alan</b>: Damiano hands out an 8: "At the risk of stereotyping myself... I think it would sell."</p>
<p>** Eleanora rolls her eyes disdainfully. **</p>
<p><b>Alan</b>: And finally, Tarno Thraddash gives out a 4, with a half smile. "Old grudge."</p>
<p><b>Eleanora</b>: That wasn't a ten before deductions. Please.</p>
<p><b>Aryk</b>: (LOL)</p>
<p><b>Alan</b>: Judges are chosen to be impartial&#8212;and if someone chooses unwisely, you're stuck.</p>
<p><b>Alan</b>: Iron Telomere echoes Eleanora's concern. "That's with the two points taken off, Entemann?"</p>
<p><b>Alan</b>: "Huh, it's not just a guideline? Hm... six, then?"</p>
<p><b>Alan</b>: Master Tanager says, "It's a guideline for me. For you it's the law."</p>
<p><b>Alan</b>: "My eight is unadorned."</p>
<p><b>Eleanora</b>: "No, it's <i>not</i> just a fuckin' <i>guideline</i>, man, get your head in the game!"</p>
<p><b>Alan</b>: Damiano nods. "Six. Six."</p>
<p><b>Aryk</b>: "Damn!"</p>
<p><b>Alan</b>: "Then the total is 17. A clean victory for Aryk!"</p>
<p>** Aryk throws his arms around and kisses on the cheek the nearest person. **</p>
<p><b>Alan</b>: "Watch out, though, kid; I think we can all agree your message and your lightwarrior won that one for you."</p>
<p><b>Eleanora</b>: "Room for that," Eleanora says complacently.</p>
<p>** Aryk nods **</p>
<p><b>Alan</b>: Master Tanager shrugs. "Everyone has opinions, Tess."</p>
<p><b>Eleanora</b>: "Yeah, an' everyone <i>should</i> have mine!"</p>
<p>** Aryk thinks "shit, if I can still deliver a message and I'm supposed to rap about bunnies... maybe I have a chance after all!" **</p>
<p><b>Alan</b>: As you clear off the stage, Jameson Talisker grabs your arm. "Hey, I've been talking to Saladin, and he wanted to talk to my friend Rinaldi about... well, okay, about crime..."</p>
<p><b>Alan</b>: "...and I told Rinaldi, he just lives down the street, I told him about you?"</p>
<p><b>Alan</b>: "And he said he heard someone set you up to lose!"</p>
<p><b>Alan</b>: "The judges are fixed!"</p>
<p><b>Alan</b>: Talisker whispers this last part.</p>
<p><b>Alan</b>: "They're supposed to shoot you down in the second-to-last round, if you get there, so you don't get in the top three!"</p>
<p><b>Aryk</b>: "What?  Nah, that can't be!"  Aryk eyes all the judges suspiciously.  </p>
<p><b>Alan</b>: Arretia is standing on tiptoe to listen in. "What? So we've got, like two hours between this and the finals to, what, investigate?"</p>
<p><b>Aryk</b>: "Who?  Which one?!"</p>
<p><b>Alan</b>: "I don't know! That's the problem! Someone was calling in favors from all over to get you to lose."</p>
<p><b>Alan</b>: "All I know is that the guy who was spreading the word in Ilium was a lightwarrior called Sadler J."</p>
<p><i>whispering to Aryk,  If I were you, I'd consider picking an honest judge and telling him/her. Risk is that you pick the wrong one, of course.</i> </p>
<p><b>Aryk</b>: "What the...?"  Aryk clenches his fist.</p>
<p><i>whispering to Aryk,  Your other option is rapping it. Up to you. :)</i> </p>
<p><b>Alan</b>: (Rather than a snappy conclusion for the session, we'll just edit this one right into the next one.)</p>
<p><b>Aryk</b>: "What.... like the purgatory guy?"</p>
<p><b>Alan</b>: "No, Sadler J's local. Monterey Heights."</p>
<p><i>whispering to Aryk,  nope... he's Dorothy's.</i> </p>
<p><i><b>Aryk</b> (whispering): I was totally thinking that!"</i></p>
<p><i><b>Aryk</b> (whispering): Ah, that's where I've heard it.</i></p>
<p><b>Aryk</b>: "Hmmm... Arretia... we got two choices.... we can try to solve this shit right now... or... we can bring it to the attention of the audience!"</p>
<p><b>Alan</b>: "How could we prove anything just by flinging accusations? We'd just turn the crowd against us."</p>
<p><b>Alan</b>: "Look, we've got one more round to think about it, then there's a break."</p>
<p><b>Alan</b>: "Let's worry about it after we win this next round!"</p>
<p><b>Alan</b>: Log is off.</p>
<p><b>Alan</b>: Whew!</p>
<p><b>Alan</b>: Now I have a birthday girl to read a poem to.</p>
<p><b>Aryk</b>: Heh.  Gotta make things complicated, don't ya, Alan?</p>
<p><b>Eleanora</b>: And I have to go kick David's ass for the "bunnies" thing. :)</p>
<p><b>Alan</b>: I couldn't resist using it.</p>
<p><b>Eleanora</b>: Too. Goddamn. Funny.</p>
<p><b>Alan</b>: And Dorothea knows who's out to get you, and she knows it's your own fault.</p>
<p><b>Eleanora</b>: I was dying over here!</p>
<p><b>Eleanora</b>: Er, I do?</p>
<p><b>Eleanora</b>: Oh, you mean... right, gotcha.</p>
<p><b>Aryk</b>: Well, I got confused about Sadler J.  I thought it was Purgatory's lightwarrior.  No.  It's Dorothy Durai's buddy, isn't it?</p>
<p><b>Alan</b>: That's unfortunately right.</p>
<p><b>Eleanora</b>: Well, you've got two weeks to think about it.</p>
<p><b>Alan</b>: Yep. You guys talk or whatever, server will be up for a bit longer.</p>
<p><b>Aryk</b>: Well, I did ask for it.  But that doesn't clue me in at all on which judge is out to screw me.</p>
<p><b>Aryk</b>: That's okay.  I'm gonna go before my eyeballs explode.</p>
<p><b>Eleanora</b>: 'k... say Happy Birthday from me, Alan!</p>
<p><b>Aryk</b>: Dorothea, I have to send you Aryk's new rap.</p>
<p><b>Eleanora</b>: yes, please!</p>
<p><b>Aryk</b>: Me too, Alan.</p>
<p><b>Eleanora</b>: (taking this to IM)</p>
<p>Disconnecting from server...</p>
<p>Game disconnected!</p>
