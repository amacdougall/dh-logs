[Sat Feb 12 18:25:12 2011] : <b>(464) Alan</b>: <font color='#612769'>The mansion of Dame Angelica Cortlandt is open, as always, to anyone who has an introduction. Not so much a patron of the arts as a patron of artists, Dame Angelica is the nurturing mother hen of Gereval's bohemian scene, always ready to ring for a plate of cold cuts at midnight and turn a blind eye to the state of the liquor cabinet at 3am.</font><br />
[Sat Feb 12 18:27:09 2011] : <b>(464) Alan</b>: <font color='#612769'>Perhaps to her surprise, Renate is instantly invigorated and refreshed upon crossing the threshold; the mansion is hallowed ground to Lyria. She has felt only the tiniest hints of this sensation when visiting Lyria's churches elsewhere. <i>I have begun to store power here and everywhere. Within a year, every church will be a reservoir of strength.</i></font><br />
[Sat Feb 12 18:27:45 2011] : <b>(462) Renate</b>: <font color='#000080'>Renate can't speak for a time. Finally she says <i>Thank you. You don't know how I needed this.</i></font><br />
[Sat Feb 12 18:29:34 2011] : <b>(464) Alan</b>: <font color='#612769'>Renate does not think Kligh is a worshipper of Lyria, but the old man stands a little straighter and moves a little more lightly as he greets his old friend Dame Angelica and makes introductions. Sabine, on the other hand, looks no different, and although Sabine notices the change in Renate, Renate feels none in her sister.</font><br />
[Sat Feb 12 18:30:13 2011] : <b>(464) Alan</b>: <font color='#612769'>Sabine has the utmost sympathy for Lyria's cause, but aligns herself with no spirit.</font><br />

[Sat Feb 12 18:31:17 2011] : <b>(462) Renate</b>: <font color='#000080'>She evinces no surprise at Kligh. She has her own ideas about what Lyria is, what She represents, and Kligh fits right into them.</font><br />
[Sat Feb 12 18:31:21 2011] : <b>(464) Alan</b>: <font color='#612769'>"It is I who am honored by you, my lady," the old woman says, dipping slightly lower curtsey, in accordance with rank, but only very slightly, in accordance with age.</font><br />
[Sat Feb 12 18:32:51 2011] : <b>(464) Alan</b>: <font color='#612769'>She speaks with the affected and haughty round tones of the purely symbolic Andragarian nobility, but they are jacketed in a carefully-modulated note of self-mockery.</font><br />

[Sat Feb 12 21:21:49 2011] : <b>(467) Alan</b>: <font color='#612769'>Every church, every circle assembled (beginning with Emmelita Devlin's arts community and spreading outward), every mystic.</font><br />

[Sat Feb 12 21:25:32 2011] : <b>(480) Alan</b>: <font color='#612769'>Renate knew about these; but another, interlocking set of memories involves dealings with dozens upon dozens of spirits, from all four planes. Some of the dealings are straightforward exchanges of power or services, but most are mathematically complex pacts involving mutual execution of contracts involving divine essence, coded information held in escrow, earthly currency, stock in corporations, or combinations of the preceding leavened with elaborate networked debt structures.</font><br />

[Sat Feb 12 21:26:42 2011] : <b>(480) Alan</b>: <font color='#612769'>These dealings explode into existence shortly after a major and costly transaction with Whirlwind Lionheart that not only cost Lyria all her hoarded essence of a thousand years, but placed an option on her very life.</font><br />
[Sat Feb 12 21:28:16 2011] : <b>(480) Alan</b>: <font color='#612769'>As Renate sorts through the chronology of the memories, she realizes that these pacts are beginning to perform, and power is flowing into Lyria's metaphorical coffers -- actually stored in her earthly altars, in her divine person, and in Faerie Realm structures -- at an extremely healthy rate.</font><br />
[Sat Feb 12 21:29:30 2011] : <b>(480) Alan</b>: <font color='#612769'>Lyria's position was as fragile as a dry wishbone a year ago; now she can command power equal to, as she puts it, "a team of strong oxen;" and soon, she will wield almost a hundredth the power of Michael.</font><br />
[Sat Feb 12 21:29:47 2011] : <b>(480) Alan</b>: <font color='#612769'>"Which," Lyria adds, "is quite a bit."</font><br />
[Sat Feb 12 21:30:33 2011] : <b>(462) Renate</b>: <font color='#000080'>"I... see. Your trust is not a small thing, Lady." For a moment, her face takes on a perturbed cast. "Did Whirlwind Lionheart <em>know</em>, when he sent me? Is that why he bought the bow?"</font><br />

[Sat Feb 12 21:34:46 2011] : <b>(480) Alan</b>: <font color='#612769'>Lyria raises a hand, and the nearest notebook flies into it; she opens it, and with the unearthly sight Lyria has granted, Renate can see it riffle through dozens and dozens of pages.

[Sat Feb 12 21:35:26 2011] : <b>(480) Alan</b>: <font color='#612769'>"Well, one joker wrote 'Dark Eternal,' but you still win by a landslide," Lyria says.</font><br />

[Sat Feb 12 21:38:56 2011] : <b>(480) Alan</b>: <font color='#612769'>So that was productive.</font><br />
[Sat Feb 12 21:39:00 2011] : <b>(462) Renate</b>: <font color='#000080'>yep!</font><br />
[Sat Feb 12 21:39:28 2011] : <b>(480) Alan</b>: <font color='#612769'>Lyria has been sort of at a loss for what to do now, so Renate's speech really did help her out.</font><br />
[Sat Feb 12 21:39:56 2011] : <b>(462) Renate</b>: <font color='#000080'>I've been thinking about that for a while. Lyria's nominal profile didn't really fit her. I sort of like her as Jungian undermind.</font><br />

[Sat Feb 12 21:41:15 2011] : <b>(480) Alan</b>: <font color='#612769'>Did I ever explain where the Dragonhunt concept of deities and essence comes from?</font><br />

[Sat Feb 12 21:42:26 2011] : <b>(462) Renate</b>: <font color='#000080'>or not that I remember, anyway</font><br />
[Sat Feb 12 21:42:29 2011] : <b>(480) Alan</b>: <font color='#612769'>Played a MUD named Avalon, in which the gods were player characters who had ascended through in-game merit. The gods were just characters themselves, albeit with superpowers. They had to recruit and coddle a circle of worshippers, who would sacrifice gold and defeated enemies, which converted directly to essence, which the gods could use to perform miracles.</font><br />
[Sat Feb 12 21:42:44 2011] : <b>(462) Renate</b>: <font color='#000080'>aha</font><br />
[Sat Feb 12 21:42:55 2011] : <b>(480) Alan</b>: <font color='#612769'>So basically, playing as a god was just a heightened, much more social and RP-focused, aspect of the game.</font><br />
[Sat Feb 12 21:43:34 2011] : <b>(480) Alan</b>: <font color='#612769'>Gods had to develop a mystique about themselves, and establish hierarchies and rituals within their cults, to retain their worshippers and inspire the worshippers to perform sacrifices.</font><br />
[Sat Feb 12 21:43:53 2011] : <b>(480) Alan</b>: <font color='#612769'>Then in return, they could spend their expendable resource -- essence -- to help their worshippers or harm their enemies.</font><br />
[Sat Feb 12 21:44:43 2011] : <b>(480) Alan</b>: <font color='#612769'>Since it essence was part of the game "economy," divine wrath was an accepted part of gameplay: piss off a god, and he's within his rights to kill you over and over with unavoidable divine wrath (the literal command was "zap")... because if he does that, sure, you lose XP, but he loses essence.</font><br />
[Sat Feb 12 21:45:25 2011] : <b>(480) Alan</b>: <font color='#612769'>Those games had socially-aware group-dynamic-focused incentive/reward schemes long before Facebook.</font><br />
[Sat Feb 12 21:45:36 2011] : <b>(462) Renate</b>: <font color='#000080'>nice!</font><br />
[Sat Feb 12 21:46:03 2011] : <b>(480) Alan</b>: <font color='#612769'>So anyway, Dragonhunt deities are based pretty closely on Avalon ones.</font><br />
[Sat Feb 12 21:46:33 2011] : <b>(480) Alan</b>: <font color='#612769'>Just because it was a solid idea that cuts down on the innate arbitrariness of your standard omnipotent god-concept.</font><br />
[Sat Feb 12 21:47:15 2011] : <b>(480) Alan</b>: <font color='#612769'>This is part of what makes the True King / Great Lord concept so subversive, even if few people in the game are capable of putting it in those terms...</font><br />
[Sat Feb 12 21:47:31 2011] : <b>(462) Renate</b>: <font color='#000080'>ah, quite</font><br />
[Sat Feb 12 21:47:41 2011] : <b>(462) Renate</b>: <font color='#000080'>power that doesn't have a reciprocal relationship involved</font><br />
[Sat Feb 12 21:47:46 2011] : <b>(480) Alan</b>: <font color='#612769'>...when an archangel is just a powerful being who has accumulated a great but finite store of power, what effect does a truly inscrutable, truly omnipotent being have?</font><br />
