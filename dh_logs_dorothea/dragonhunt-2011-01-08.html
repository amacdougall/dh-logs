[Sat Jan  8 18:31:49 2011] : <b>(8175) Alan</b>: <font color='#612769'>Oh yeah. What's your current political stance vis-a-vis Brosford? Currently your baronies have no regular trade with Brosford, and no diplomatic relationship, even though it's only, what, a day away? The highroads feeding Brosford don't actually go anywhere near your baronies in the first place.</font><br />
[Sat Jan  8 18:32:05 2011] : <b>(8175) Alan</b>: <font color='#612769'>So if you want, you can easily just wash your hands of them.</font><br />
[Sat Jan  8 18:32:54 2011] : <b>(8175) Alan</b>: <font color='#612769'>Thinking about it, I would have made Brosford more like three days away. That better suits its importance to your baronies.</font><br />

[Sat Jan  8 18:33:05 2011] : <b>(8175) Alan</b>: <font color='#612769'>If it's just a day, then it would naturally have become a trading partner.</font><br />
[Sat Jan  8 18:33:15 2011] : <b>(8175) Alan</b>: <font color='#612769'>We could just <i>make</i> it three days.</font><br />
[Sat Jan  8 18:33:21 2011] : <b>(8176) Aryk</b>: <font color='#800000'>Well, a relationship needs to be established, and legitimate trade would be good (though, admittedly, Brosford probably has next to nothing legal that's valuable to trade), but maybe with some poking and prodding that can be changed.</font><br />
[Sat Jan  8 18:33:21 2011] : <b>(8174) Renate</b>: <font color='#000080'>(that's fine)</font><br />
[Sat Jan  8 18:33:41 2011] : <b>(8174) Renate</b>: <font color='#000080'>Well, Renate's opinion is that even three days away, that's too close for a thriving Glitter trade.</font><br />
[Sat Jan  8 18:33:49 2011] : <b>(8174) Renate</b>: <font color='#000080'>So Miss Violet needs to have a stop put to her.</font><br />
[Sat Jan  8 18:34:05 2011] : <b>(8175) Alan</b>: <font color='#612769'>This also suits my DM purposes, because there are things past and future that just don't make sense without a sizeable communications lag.</font><br />
[Sat Jan  8 18:34:09 2011] : <b>(8174) Renate</b>: <font color='#000080'>She has written to the Seven Stars explaining the situation there, with evidence.</font><br />
[Sat Jan  8 18:34:37 2011] : <b>(8175) Alan</b>: <font color='#612769'>Like, how would you not have heard about Heliomere gathering an army there? There would have been regular trade, meaning you would have heard it from peddlers.</font><br />
[Sat Jan  8 18:34:41 2011] : <b>(8173) Rien</b>: <font color='#263607'>And Fate being what it is, if Miss Violet is ousted from Brosford, then she's likely to try and get a toe-hold in one of our Baronies, not move even further away.</font><br />
[Sat Jan  8 18:34:52 2011] : <b>(8175) Alan</b>: <font color='#612769'>But if the baronies are inconveniently far away, it makes sense you didn't hear.</font><br />
[Sat Jan  8 18:34:55 2011] : <b>(8174) Renate</b>: <font color='#000080'>yep</font><br />
[Sat Jan  8 18:35:06 2011] : <b>(8175) Alan</b>: <font color='#612769'>Let me turn the log on...</font><br />
[Sat Jan  8 18:35:54 2011] : <b>(8175) Alan</b>: <font color='#612769'>Let the record hereby show that Brosford is now three days from Carrackshire at the pace of a caravan, and a day and a half for a quick but not punishing ride on horseback.</font><br />
[Sat Jan  8 18:36:15 2011] : <b>(8175) Alan</b>: <font color='#612769'>Therefore, Brosford and the baronies have never established regular commerce, the baronies not having all that much that Brosford wants.</font><br />
[Sat Jan  8 18:36:41 2011] : <b>(8174) Renate</b>: <font color='#000080'>(Which makes it all the more suspicious that our boy Spike is a known figure there.)</font><br />

[Sat Jan  8 21:03:49 2011] : <b>(8188) Alan</b>: <font color='#612769'>"The same way it fares every day, my lord. Wonderful!"</font><br />
[Sat Jan  8 21:04:06 2011] : <b>(8188) Alan</b>: <font color='#612769'>Either the Grovekeeper handpicks his dryads for cheerfulness, or being a tree is totally rad.</font><br />

[Sat Jan  8 21:06:44 2011] : <b>(8188) Alan</b>: <font color='#612769'>(Marie is more childlike; Jeanette takes the form and mannerisms of a mature and, Aryk at least can't help noticing, zaftig woman.)</font><br />
[Sat Jan  8 21:07:55 2011] : <b>(8188) Alan</b>: <font color='#612769'>Jeanette taps a finger on her cheek thoughtfully. "You know him, he's never a big audience-granter. But I bet he'll make an exception for you. Not only are you the baron, but you've made a point of helping us on every front. I'll go get his attention, if he isn't already listening in... oh! Here we are already!"</font><br />
[Sat Jan  8 21:08:32 2011] : <b>(8188) Alan</b>: <font color='#612769'>She looks toward the tree next to the one she came out of; that tree is shrinking and stretching into the shape of a three-meter-tall humanoid.</font><br />
[Sat Jan  8 21:09:38 2011] : <b>(8188) Alan</b>: <font color='#612769'>When the transformation is complete, the tree stands head and shoulders over Aryk, with a drooping crown of leaves standing in for hair and a pattern of knots forming an impressionist face. It hunkers down to get to eye level with Rien.</font><br />
