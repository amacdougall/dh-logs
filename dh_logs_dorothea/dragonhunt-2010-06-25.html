[Fri Jun 25 19:06:19 2010] : <b>(737) Alan</b>: <font color='#00008c'>The earth dragon skids to a stop, letting loose with an earth-shaking roar which disorients everyone on the field, and physically knocks back everyone within a few meters of him, friend and foe alike.</font><br />
[Fri Jun 25 19:06:37 2010] : <b>(737) Alan</b>: <font color='#00008c'>This includes Aryk, but it doesn't damage Aryk either, so you're back at square one.</font><br />

[Fri Jun 25 19:10:18 2010] : <b>(738) Aryk</b>: <font color='#800000'>Aryk lands on his feet in a crouch, ready to spring.  "You know a little... hah hah... mouthwash might just clear that up, Gimpy."

[Fri Jun 25 19:12:24 2010] : <b>(737) Alan</b>: <font color='#00008c'>The earth dragon's center of mass seems to be just behind its massively muscled shoulderblades, because it's able to pivot swiftly and block Aryk's downward flaming slash with its steel-hard teeth: Aryk bounces off as though he'd just hacked at an anvil, and recovers in midair.</font><br />
[Fri Jun 25 19:12:50 2010] : <b>(737) Alan</b>: <font color='#00008c'>(Imagine this dragon as looking like a bulldog with a giant grin like a Spawn villain.)</font><br />

She just manages to make the right choice every single time. Black Inferno fire wave to clear an escape path; Dragon Sword slash cyclone to repel multiple attackers; Wrenfall Jet Counter to slip away from a clash entirely. Where did she learn that?

The smoke coalesces into Holmstock, who feints a spear-stab; Gades reflexively bares his teeth to block it, giving Aryk freedom to cripple the other leg with another Fire Emblem.</font><br />

[Fri Jun 25 19:59:12 2010] : <b>(737) Alan</b>: <font color='#00008c'>Speaking of evil, Rien notices the leylines burst into angry life -- someone is drawing upon their power, and it doesn't seem organic to the leylines, so it's probably not the Grovekeeper.</font><br />
[Fri Jun 25 20:00:31 2010] : <b>(737) Alan</b>: <font color='#00008c'>Rien pops out of his portal in time to see the Unstoppable Force spinning to the ground, leaving a spiral trail of ethereal white fire behind him.

[Fri Jun 25 20:00:48 2010] : <b>(737) Alan</b>: <font color='#00008c'>They're treating Rien with a sudden respect.</font><br />
[Fri Jun 25 20:00:58 2010] : <b>(738) Aryk</b>: <font color='#800000'>With the dragon's movement impaired, Aryk has an easier time locating and striking weaker points in the dragon's rocky armor, hopefully opening him up for damaging maneuvers.

[Fri Jun 25 20:02:58 2010] : <b>(737) Alan</b>: <font color='#00008c'>Aryk is sadly correct. Holmstock yells, "Jump!" just as the earth begins to shake violently beneath him.</font><br />
