[Fri Dec 29 19:48:28 2006] : <B>(1) Alan</B>: <font color='#000000'>A prolonged war is unlikely to occur, gossipmongers admit; the most common view is that the king and Genjiro must win quickly and decisively, or their alliance of lesser dragons will fall apart under the indignity of being commanded by mortals.</font><br>
[Fri Dec 29 19:49:23 2006] : <B>(1) Alan</B>: <font color='#000000'>And Shadow-Watcher must win as quickly, because if the war is allowed to fall apart by chaos, his subtle authority will be lost among his most important constituents, the new-made business barons of greater Vollis.</font><br>
[Fri Dec 29 19:50:18 2006] : <B>(1) Alan</B>: <font color='#000000'>Those barons, for their own part, are watching to see which way the coin lands. They have offered attractive prices to the king's forces in Vollis, because it was that or see their wares seized; but clearly they would offer the same to anyone ruling the city.</font><br>

[Fri Dec 29 19:53:44 2006] : <B>(2) Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>Mm. Renate's more interested in where SW's command-post is likely to be.</font><br>
[Fri Dec 29 19:53:46 2006] : <B>(1) Alan</B>: <font color='#000000'>Shadow-watcher would not be approaching from that direction if he had more time for maneuvering; the Tomb of Fujii is a valley, wide enough for battles, not as easy to defend as some canyon, but still a forbidding battleground for the attacker.</font><br>
