[Fri Nov  4 23:09:09 2005] : <B>(4) Aryk</B>: <font color='#000080'>At some point, Alan, we have to get together for that.  Aryk needs to feel Ricard out on some new ideas forming in his head.  Primarily concerning Emily, Michael, Kahan, and the True King.</font><br>
[Fri Nov  4 23:09:22 2005] : <B>(3) Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>Yeah! Go Aryk!</font><br>
[Fri Nov  4 23:09:34 2005] : <B>(3) Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>And if he wants to talk it over with Renate, she's always there.</font><br>

[Fri Nov  4 23:11:06 2005] : <B>(3) Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>I don't think that's something Ricard is capable of saying. But we'll see.</font><br>
[Fri Nov  4 23:11:29 2005] : <B>(3) Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>Not in theological matters, anyway. Public drunkenness, losing money at gambling, yeah.</font><br>

[Fri Nov  4 23:12:16 2005] : <B>(2) Rien</B>: <font color='#004040'>He's bitched him out about those matters before, I believe</font><br>
[Fri Nov  4 23:12:19 2005] : <B>(4) Aryk</B>: <font color='#000080'>Well, you know what I mean though.  If Ricard thinks Aryk is just dead wrong with this whole True King business, or how he proposes to deal with Emily, that will have a profound effect on how Aryk is going to develop out of this whole situation.</font><br>
[Fri Nov  4 23:12:25 2005] : <B>(3) Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>Sure.</font><br>
[Fri Nov  4 23:12:35 2005] : <B>(3) Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>But as an angel, Ricard has to follow where Aryk leads.</font><br>
[Fri Nov  4 23:12:41 2005] : <B>(4) Aryk</B>: <font color='#000080'>Yeah, it's pretty obvious already that Ricard doesn't think too highly of Emily.  Especially know.</font><br>
[Fri Nov  4 23:12:43 2005] : <B>(2) Rien</B>: <font color='#004040'>yep</font><br>
[Fri Nov  4 23:12:52 2005] : <B>(2) Rien</B>: <font color='#004040'>Ricard is shaped by Aryk's motivations and feelings</font><br>
[Fri Nov  4 23:13:10 2005] : <B>(2) Rien</B>: <font color='#004040'>so he's probably not capable of saying that something is wrong unless Aryk feels that it's wrong</font><br>
[Fri Nov  4 23:13:17 2005] : <B>(2) Rien</B>: <font color='#004040'>by which point he probably doesn't need telling</font><br>
[Fri Nov  4 23:13:22 2005] : <B>(3) Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>well, he can quote Scripture</font><br>
[Fri Nov  4 23:13:30 2005] : <B>(3) Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>but he can't stop Aryk</font><br>

[Fri Nov  4 23:13:59 2005] : <B>(3) Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>oh, and ordinarily Ren would be kicking Aryk's butt for mentioning Emil outside their little circle :P</font><br>
[Fri Nov  4 23:14:02 2005] : <B>(1) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>He'll at least have a more conservative viewpoint.</font><br>
[Fri Nov  4 23:14:02 2005] : <B>(3) Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>but not tonight</font><br>
[Fri Nov  4 23:14:18 2005] : <B>(1) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>To the extent that he reflects Aryk, he reflects Aryk's inner Church-dogma conscience.</font><br>
[Fri Nov  4 23:14:40 2005] : <B>(3) Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>Hm. That could get to be a mighty interesting conversation, then.</font><br>
[Fri Nov  4 23:14:49 2005] : <B>(1) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>And he is thousands of years old, technically; it's just that angels don't emotionally mature and grow in wisdom in quite the same way as mortals.</font><br>
[Fri Nov  4 23:15:12 2005] : <B>(4) Aryk</B>: <font color='#000080'>I was wondering if that would be bad.</font><br>
[Fri Nov  4 23:15:13 2005] : <B>(3) Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>Well, if you set up a time for it, let me know; I'd like to listen in.</font><br>
[Fri Nov  4 23:15:31 2005] : <B>(3) Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>Well, dammit, Aryk has to learn to stick to his guns.</font><br>
[Fri Nov  4 23:15:47 2005] : <B>(3) Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>And out of something other than spite or pique.</font><br>
[Fri Nov  4 23:15:52 2005] : <B>(4) Aryk</B>: <font color='#000080'>We'll see.  FYI, folks, I can't play on the 18th.  Eye surgery.</font><br>

[Fri Nov  4 23:16:13 2005] : <B>(2) Rien</B>: <font color='#004040'>that's more than okay</font><br>
[Fri Nov  4 23:16:14 2005] : <B>(4) Aryk</B>: <font color='#000080'>Aryk's still trying to figure out which guns he has.</font><br>
[Fri Nov  4 23:16:28 2005] : <B>(2) Rien</B>: <font color='#004040'>how many treatments are required, did they tell you?</font><br>

[Fri Nov  4 23:17:01 2005] : <B>(4) Aryk</B>: <font color='#000080'>Just one, and it's minor.  They said it will only take one day to recover.</font><br>
[Fri Nov  4 23:17:15 2005] : <B>(4) Aryk</B>: <font color='#000080'>Only one eye, too.  The other one is more or less okay.</font><br>
[Fri Nov  4 23:17:17 2005] : <B>(4) Aryk</B>: <font color='#000080'>For now, anyway.</font><br>
[Fri Nov  4 23:17:18 2005] : <B>(3) Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>Oh, that's not so bad.</font><br>
