[Fri Apr  1 18:08:11 2011] : <b>(33) Rien</b>: <font color='#263607'>Hullo</font><br />
[Fri Apr  1 18:08:21 2011] : <b>(32) Wren Kuhn</b>: <font color='#000080'>How are things?</font><br />
[Fri Apr  1 18:09:02 2011] : <b>(34) Alan</b>: <font color='#612769'>Having been hit on by men, I can confirm that it's disorienting and unnerving.</font><br />
[Fri Apr  1 18:09:17 2011] : <b>(32) Wren Kuhn</b>: <font color='#000080'>No intrinsic reason it should be.</font><br />
[Fri Apr  1 18:09:20 2011] : <b>(34) Alan</b>: <font color='#612769'>I can see how if I were homophobic, I'd be angry about it.</font><br />
[Fri Apr  1 18:09:45 2011] : <b>(34) Alan</b>: <font color='#612769'>No intrinsic reason, sure, I just didn't have a social toolkit for handling the situation.</font><br />
[Fri Apr  1 18:09:50 2011] : <b>(32) Wren Kuhn</b>: <font color='#000080'>Um, which in no way at all makes it an acceptable response.</font><br />
[Fri Apr  1 18:09:57 2011] : <b>(34) Alan</b>: <font color='#612769'>Of course, in a video game, the social toolkit is clicking the "no" button.</font><br />
[Fri Apr  1 18:10:38 2011] : <b>(34) Alan</b>: <font color='#612769'>My response has always been to smile and banter and attempt to politely disengage, which doesn't work on the types of people (of whatever orientation) who walk up and make direct advances. Whoops!</font><br />
[Fri Apr  1 18:12:15 2011] : <b>(34) Alan</b>: <font color='#612769'>For the record, I've never known what to do on the equally-infrequent cases where a woman has made unwelcome advances. Come to think of it, I don't know if the gender thing made an appreciable difference.</font><br />
[Fri Apr  1 18:12:32 2011] : <b>(34) Alan</b>: <font color='#612769'>Maybe it was just "whoa, nelly, where did that come from" in all cases.</font><br />
[Fri Apr  1 18:12:49 2011] : <b>(34) Alan</b>: <font color='#612769'>I guess I need a really attractive guy to hit on me so I can find out.</font><br />
[Fri Apr  1 18:13:02 2011] : <b>(32) Wren Kuhn</b>: <font color='#000080'>"Flattered, but taken" is always an acceptable response, even when it's a white lie. Unless, y'know, you're hitting on random people at the same event.</font><br />
[Fri Apr  1 18:13:12 2011] : <b>(34) Alan</b>: <font color='#612769'>Not my style.</font><br />
[Fri Apr  1 18:13:26 2011] : <b>(34) Alan</b>: <font color='#612769'>And yeah, I was too flustered to come up with anything. Heh.</font><br />

[Fri Apr  1 18:14:35 2011] : <b>(33) Rien</b>: <font color='#263607'>In the infrequent times people of either gender who are on the prowl focus on me.</font><br />
[Fri Apr  1 18:14:59 2011] : <b>(34) Alan</b>: <font color='#612769'>I hit on carefully targeted preselected people at times convenient and mutually agreed upon by both of us.</font><br />

[Fri Apr  1 18:17:01 2011] : <b>(34) Alan</b>: <font color='#612769'>So, we were last in the east of Sune, preparing to cross over to Maal. Emil, Wren, Dannyl, Coris, Leonid, Rien, and a band of about twenty hobgoblin irregulars are the hunting party so far, right?</font><br />
[Fri Apr  1 18:17:13 2011] : <b>(33) Rien</b>: <font color='#263607'>Roight.</font><br />
[Fri Apr  1 18:17:20 2011] : <b>(34) Alan</b>: <font color='#612769'>Okay.</font><br />
[Fri Apr  1 18:19:23 2011] : <b>(34) Alan</b>: <font color='#612769'>"King Sesshu offered me an army unit, a hundred strong, as honor guard," Coris says as he watches his men at morning practice. Frost is still thick on the ground, this high in the mountains; the hobgoblins are thoroughly inured to the thinner air, but when Leonid tried to follow their moves, he found himself gasping almost immediately.</font><br />

[Fri Apr  1 18:22:34 2011] : <b>(33) Rien</b>: <font color='#263607'>"To what use do you hope they'll be put?"</font><br />
[Fri Apr  1 18:22:35 2011] : <b>(34) Alan</b>: <font color='#612769'>"A lot of these guys are immigrants from Maal. One even comes from Shotenmachi; he asked not to be singled out, so I won't name him."</font><br />

[Fri Apr  1 20:44:02 2011] : <b>(35) Alan</b>: <font color='#612769'>Coris nods. "Mages, you'll have to go first with full defenses and start dispelling. Dannyl, do you have one of the Master scrolls?"</font><br />
[Fri Apr  1 20:44:10 2011] : <b>(35) Alan</b>: <font color='#612769'>Dannyl says, "Do we really need it?"</font><br />
[Fri Apr  1 20:44:34 2011] : <b>(35) Alan</b>: <font color='#612769'>"Would you rather rely on elixirs? Your call."</font><br />
[Fri Apr  1 20:44:42 2011] : <b>(35) Alan</b>: <font color='#612769'>Dannyl shrugs. "Scroll it is."</font><br />
[Fri Apr  1 20:44:57 2011] : <b>(35) Alan</b>: <font color='#612769'>He takes a scroll from his scroll belt and breaks the Spellbreaker seal.</font><br />
[Fri Apr  1 20:45:29 2011] : <b>(35) Alan</b>: <font color='#612769'>"I'll read it and turn the corner at the last second. When I do the final dodecasyllabation, go ahead and cover me," he says to Rien and Leonid.</font><br />
[Fri Apr  1 20:45:41 2011] : <b>(35) Alan</b>: <font color='#612769'>"I'll cover you as well," Emil says. "I have spell shields."</font><br />
[Fri Apr  1 20:46:06 2011] : <b>(33) Rien</b>: <font color='#263607'>Rien is focused down the cave, his eyes flicking from spell to spell laid down in front of them, looking for the weak spots in the weave of each.  "You may all wish to keep a meter distance from me at all times."</font><br />
[Fri Apr  1 20:47:02 2011] : <b>(35) Alan</b>: <font color='#612769'>Dannyl starts to read the Spellbreaker scroll; the words could be memorized, but the true magic is in the scroll itself. The words disappear as they are read. At the final word, Dannyl steps boldly around the corner, with Emil projecting a ghostly blue octagon from his left forearm like a shield before him. Rien and Leonid are to flank him with defenses of their own.</font><br />
[Fri Apr  1 20:48:19 2011] : <b>(35) Alan</b>: <font color='#612769'>The scroll dispel practically scorches the ether in front of Dannyl -- Rien's magical sight perceives it as a sort of fire-blast sculpted of steel cords, shredding all magical patterns ahead of it for twenty meters. It's a serious piece of magical technology, almost as strong as the one Evantin Barious gave you to deal with Keph LoCaine.</font><br />
[Fri Apr  1 20:48:28 2011] : <b>(32) Wren Kuhn</b>: <font color='#000080'>Wren flattens herself against the rock, shielded from whatever Heliomere unleashes from his current position.</font><br />
[Fri Apr  1 20:49:27 2011] : <b>(35) Alan</b>: <font color='#612769'>Heliomere's counterstrike, a three-forked thunderbolt, is splintered to nothing by the dispel. Those without magic see the entire action as Heliomere casting a brief flash that comes to nothing, and then a second of pregnant silence.</font><br />
[Fri Apr  1 20:50:28 2011] : <b>(35) Alan</b>: <font color='#612769'>Heliomere, realizing what has happened, roars incoherently and rushes forward, charging at full speed toward Emil. "Robes down, swords up!" Emil yells, dropping his spell shield and assuming an Eternal Capital fighting stance.</font><br />
[Fri Apr  1 20:50:35 2011] : <b>(33) Rien</b>: <font color='#263607'>Rien breaks this silence by charging forward suddenly, sooty black smoke streaming from his deep red eyes.  He flashes through several spells, firing off lightning, air and unholy energy in quick succession</font><br />
[Fri Apr  1 20:51:06 2011] : <b>(35) Alan</b>: <font color='#612769'>Dannyl retreats around the corner as Coris and his men come up to join Emil. Leonid, after a second's confusion, follows suit.</font><br />
[Fri Apr  1 20:51:24 2011] : <b>(32) Wren Kuhn</b>: <font color='#000080'>Wren peeks out and waits her chance, again.</font><br />
[Fri Apr  1 20:53:10 2011] : <b>(35) Alan</b>: <font color='#612769'>The spells strike Heliomere with precision, but the dragon has utterly committed to his attack; Heliomere bulls through Rien's spells and slams into him fangs first, striking with two lightning bolt spells and a vicious bite at the same time. If not for Rien's mythril armor, he'd be killed instantly; instead, Heliomere's teeth close on him and rebound, giving him just time to pull his arm and chest away.</font><br />
[Fri Apr  1 20:53:31 2011] : <b>(35) Alan</b>: <font color='#612769'>The lightning, however, sends him stunned and reeling away from the melee, and the bite still knocks the wind out of him.</font><br />
[Fri Apr  1 20:55:08 2011] : <b>(35) Alan</b>: <font color='#612769'>Heliomere's focus on Rien gives Emil a clear strike at him, though, which means that wounding Rien might already have cost him. Emil attacks with one of the signature sword-and-magic moves, opening gaping bloody wounds on Heliomere's neck near the base of his skull and laying open tendons.</font><br />
[Fri Apr  1 20:55:37 2011] : <b>(32) Wren Kuhn</b>: <font color='#000080'>(Any hint of buffs on Heliomere?)</font><br />
[Fri Apr  1 20:55:42 2011] : <b>(35) Alan</b>: <font color='#612769'>Heliomere whips his head around to knock Emil away, but Emil is already gone, like a fly that senses the swatter.</font><br />
[Fri Apr  1 20:55:54 2011] : <b>(35) Alan</b>: <font color='#612769'>(There sure aren't anymore! That scroll did a number on him.)</font><br />
[Fri Apr  1 20:56:25 2011] : <b>(35) Alan</b>: <font color='#612769'>Heliomere's skin ripples and turns steely gray (okay, now there is).</font><br />
[Fri Apr  1 20:56:54 2011] : <b>(35) Alan</b>: <font color='#612769'>Leonid, from behind the line of fighters, immediately dispels it, using a distance antimagic technique Rien finds quite interesting.</font><br />
[Fri Apr  1 20:57:00 2011] : <b>(32) Wren Kuhn</b>: <font color='#000080'>(Righty-ho.)</font><br />
[Fri Apr  1 20:57:17 2011] : <b>(33) Rien</b>: <font color='#263607'>Rien sucks in a heavy lungful of air, and gives a very dragon-like roar and leaps back up after Heliomere, screaming, "Renate isn't here for you to hurt, wyrmling.  You cannot use us against each other this time.  I will never make that mistake again!"  Rien's sword, though it is still partially transparent, clangs off Heliomere's skin an instant before Leonid's dispell.</font><br />
[Fri Apr  1 20:58:20 2011] : <b>(35) Alan</b>: <font color='#612769'>Coris follows Emil and strikes Heliomere's other side; his first attack clangs off the newly-metallic skin and the second comes right after Leonid's dispel. Coris stabs a good ten centimeters into the dragon's neck, but doesn't find anything vital. Like many more powerful dragons, Heliomere's muscle is tough as leather all the way down to the bone.</font><br />
[Fri Apr  1 20:59:29 2011] : <b>(35) Alan</b>: <font color='#612769'>Emil and Coris continue to his Heliomere's head from either side, while Dannyl and Leonid methodically throw dispels at him over and over to simply prevent him from casting anything at all.</font><br />
[Fri Apr  1 20:59:51 2011] : <b>(35) Alan</b>: <font color='#612769'>And since Heliomere is not a physical fighter, his head quickly begins to resemble an overtaxed pi&ntilde;ata.</font><br />
[Fri Apr  1 21:00:00 2011] : <b>(35) Alan</b>: <font color='#612769'>s/his/hit</font><br />
[Fri Apr  1 21:00:16 2011] : <b>(33) Rien</b>: <font color='#263607'>(When Rien said they might want to keep away from him, it's about to be Why)</font><br />
[Fri Apr  1 21:01:02 2011] : <b>(35) Alan</b>: <font color='#612769'>Finally, Heliomere finds a break in Leonid and Dannyl's timing, and manages an explosive earth blast that shakes ice loose from the ceiling and knocks Coris and Emil away; both of them twist and land safely, each in the same fighting stance.</font><br />
[Fri Apr  1 21:01:13 2011] : <b>(35) Alan</b>: <font color='#612769'>Almost embarassed, Coris switches back to Wrenfall a second later.</font><br />
[Fri Apr  1 21:02:12 2011] : <b>(35) Alan</b>: <font color='#612769'>Heliomere is moving slow, and leaving a wide bloody trail as he slowly retreats toward the blank cave wall.</font><br />
[Fri Apr  1 21:02:27 2011] : <b>(35) Alan</b>: <font color='#612769'>He tries another spell, but Dannyl counterspells it again.</font><br />
[Fri Apr  1 21:03:02 2011] : <b>(33) Rien</b>: <font color='#263607'>Rien appears in front of Heliomere, and the air around him takes on a peculiar tension that even those with no magical abilities can feel.  "No more life for you, Wyrmling.  No more lives for you to take.  Your story ends here, with a painful death and a life swiftly forgotten.  It is over.  You are <b>Out of Time</b>."  Flashing forward again, Rien's sword seems to emit a paper-thin aura that leaves a trail of sparkling blue artifacts behind it, sweeping through the centre of Heliomere's skull.</font><br />
[Fri Apr  1 21:03:04 2011] : <font color='#008000'>** (32) Wren Kuhn <font color='#008000'>takes the opportunity to fire a few throwing stars, just to keep the creature off-balance.</font> **</font><br />
[Fri Apr  1 21:04:40 2011] : <b>(35) Alan</b>: <font color='#612769'>One half of Heliomere's head simply disappears. Just for an eyeblink, or less.</font><br />
[Fri Apr  1 21:04:55 2011] : <b>(35) Alan</b>: <font color='#612769'>When it reappears a split-second in the future, it is no longer connected to the other half.</font><br />
[Fri Apr  1 21:05:35 2011] : <b>(35) Alan</b>: <font color='#612769'>Without so much as a dying whisper, the dragon collapses the ground, head falling in half like a watermelon cut by an axe.</font><br />
[Fri Apr  1 21:05:43 2011] : <b>(32) Wren Kuhn</b>: <font color='#000080'>Wren's mouth frames a silent "Whoa."</font><br />
[Fri Apr  1 21:06:01 2011] : <b>(35) Alan</b>: <font color='#612769'>"Amazing," Emil says with awe.</font><br />
[Fri Apr  1 21:06:45 2011] : <b>(35) Alan</b>: <font color='#612769'>Coris starts clapping, and the hobgoblins (who didn't really get a chance to do anything) start clapping as well, picking up his exact rhythm.</font><br />
[Fri Apr  1 21:06:52 2011] : <b>(33) Rien</b>: <font color='#263607'>Rien is gripping the hilt of his sword white-knuckled, and for a moment, maybe less, he stares at the split skull of his enemy.  Suddenly, his sword becomes a real thing of razor-sharp steel, and he charges forward again, hacking wildly at the dragon's corpse.</font><br />
[Fri Apr  1 21:07:06 2011] : <b>(35) Alan</b>: <font color='#612769'>After exactly twenty-four claps, they all yell the same word at the same time, so loudly you can't tell what it is.</font><br />
[Fri Apr  1 21:07:50 2011] : <b>(35) Alan</b>: <font color='#612769'>"Whoa, whoa, calm down," Emil says softly, clasping Rien's shoulders while deftly avoiding his wildly swinging sword.</font><br />
[Fri Apr  1 21:07:58 2011] : <b>(35) Alan</b>: <font color='#612769'>"He's done. You got him."</font><br />
[Fri Apr  1 21:08:00 2011] : <b>(32) Wren Kuhn</b>: <font color='#000080'>"Um," Wren says again, coming toward Coris. "I'm not going to stop him. Are you?"</font><br />
[Fri Apr  1 21:08:32 2011] : <b>(35) Alan</b>: <font color='#612769'>"I leave that to reckless people," Coris says, gesturing to Rien and Emil.</font><br />
[Fri Apr  1 21:08:55 2011] : <b>(33) Rien</b>: <font color='#263607'>Rien stops, and mutters soft as breath between clenched teeth, "he hurt Renate... and so did I."</font><br />
[Fri Apr  1 21:09:46 2011] : <b>(35) Alan</b>: <font color='#612769'>"That's to talk about over a few stiff drinks, which we all deserve. Right now let's clean up the body, clear the area, settle things in Shotenmachi just to be thorough."</font><br />
[Fri Apr  1 21:11:00 2011] : <b>(33) Rien</b>: <font color='#263607'>"I would drop him into the Mother right here and now, if I didn't think that Fate would bring him back as something far worse."  <i>Something like me</i>.</font><br />
[Fri Apr  1 21:11:32 2011] : <b>(35) Alan</b>: <font color='#612769'>A heavy strongbox at the back of the cave holds coins, gems, and bullion worth a few dozen gold, in Wren's appraisal. Not much by dragon lord standards. It also has a few trophies -- a magic dagger, Renate's lasso, a bone, a drinking cup.</font><br />
[Fri Apr  1 21:11:51 2011] : <b>(35) Alan</b>: <font color='#612769'>The dagger isn't particularly magical. Just permanently sharp. It might have been held for its sale value.</font><br />
[Fri Apr  1 21:13:07 2011] : <b>(35) Alan</b>: <font color='#612769'>Coris hands Rien the coiled lasso and shakes his hand. "Very well done. Very well done."</font><br />
