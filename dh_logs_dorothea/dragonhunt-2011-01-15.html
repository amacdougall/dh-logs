[Sat Jan 15 17:38:38 2011] : <b>(8593) Alan</b>: <font color='#612769'>Renate has received a note of credit from the Company, in quite a large sum.

[Sat Jan 15 19:08:36 2011] : <b>(8593) Alan</b>: <font color='#612769'>Shadow Square is always in the shadow of Sunset Park, as that floating island transits the sky to interpose itself under the sun; but during most of the day, the square is simply pleasantly shaded, not dark. The streetlights are kept on for atmosphere. At dawn, street carts pull into their licensed spots around the square and begin selling coffee and pastries; at noon, they switch over to sandwiches and hot dishes; and in the evening, as Shadow Square sinks into blackness an hour in advance of the rest of the city, they serve leftovers to straggling office and palace workers.</font><br />
[Sat Jan 15 19:09:55 2011] : <b>(8593) Alan</b>: <font color='#612769'>Dark Eternal's palace forms one border of the grand square; the Bank of Gereval is another; and the other two, though once private mansions, are now a court complex and a prestigious office.</font><br />
[Sat Jan 15 19:12:08 2011] : <b>(8593) Alan</b>: <font color='#612769'>At the center of the square is a famous scale model of the city, divided into exaggerated pie slices representing the twenty wards; in reality, the wards are globular gerrymandered things, but in the city's central sculpture, they are nigh true.</font><br />
[Sat Jan 15 19:12:39 2011] : <b>(8593) Alan</b>: <font color='#612769'>Near the sculpture are the eight stepping discs -- four departing, four arriving -- which give access to the flying Sunset Park.</font><br />
[Sat Jan 15 19:13:26 2011] : <b>(8593) Alan</b>: <font color='#612769'>Rien knows that Dark Eternal knows he is here; Rien simply has to go somewhere that combines drama with some expectation of privacy, and Dark Eternal is sure to meet him.</font><br />
[Sat Jan 15 19:13:54 2011] : <b>(8593) Alan</b>: <font color='#612769'>Of course, Rien and Renate also have the run of the city, if there are any other errands they are inclined to do.</font><br />

[Sat Jan 15 19:17:46 2011] : <b>(8593) Alan</b>: <font color='#612769'>The Heaven office informs Renate that Sir Will last reported from Larkspur, in Vesper, where he chose to take a hand in a territorial dispute between the ruling dragon and the dragon's belligerent brother.

Her history is heavily edited. The news is surprisingly impartial -- the <i>Star</i> reports that Dark Eternal's "strategic alliances" with neighboring kingdoms have had the look of proxy wars, the "defense partners" look like vassals, and that DE is probably gearing up for an expansion. The <i>Star</i> is not really on board with the prospect, but they're willing to support northward or eastward expansion if it's done carefully.</font><br />

[Sat Jan 15 19:27:16 2011] : <b>(8593) Alan</b>: <font color='#612769'>Interestingly, the <i>Journal</i> quotes Eventide himself as saying that if DE were to deploy Heaven or Hell against the Silver Coast, it would break certain Accords which have not previously been applied to such situations.</font><br />
[Sat Jan 15 19:27:43 2011] : <b>(8593) Alan</b>: <font color='#612769'>It sounds like Dark Eternal has taken a beating in the Great Council.</font><br />

[Sat Jan 15 19:42:16 2011] : <b>(8593) Alan</b>: <font color='#612769'>Okay, so, they'll see if they can get word to him. Maybe if he passes through town before they get sent on another assignment.</font><br />
[Sat Jan 15 19:42:31 2011] : <b>(8579) Renate</b>: <font color='#000080'>Coolio.</font><br />
[Sat Jan 15 19:42:36 2011] : <b>(8593) Alan</b>: <font color='#612769'>Right now they and Templeton are on leave. Templeton's visiting his family.</font><br />
[Sat Jan 15 19:43:03 2011] : <b>(8593) Alan</b>: <font color='#612769'>Sabra and Randall are pondering marriage. Because why not, at this point?</font><br />
[Sat Jan 15 19:43:11 2011] : <b>(8581) Rien</b>: <font color='#263607'>Why not indeed?</font><br />
[Sat Jan 15 19:43:17 2011] : <b>(8579) Renate</b>: <font color='#000080'>They will both get big hugs from Ren for that. :)</font><br />

[Sat Jan 15 19:46:46 2011] : <b>(8593) Alan</b>: <font color='#612769'>At dawn then, we'll assume, shortly after the floating island has finished its night-time recrossing of the sky to intercept the sun's first rays.</font><br />
[Sat Jan 15 19:47:08 2011] : <b>(8581) Rien</b>: <font color='#263607'>Why not.</font><br />
[Sat Jan 15 19:47:46 2011] : <b>(8593) Alan</b>: <font color='#612769'>Rien is not surprised to find Dark Eternal already waiting for him. He knows the old dragon's tricks -- he actually positions an illusion keyed to be visible only to the intended interviewee, and then if the subject happens to arrive, he blinks into its place.</font><br />
[Sat Jan 15 19:48:02 2011] : <b>(8593) Alan</b>: <font color='#612769'>If the subject never comes, the illusion eventually runs out of power and disappears, never seen by anyone.</font><br />

[Sat Jan 15 19:49:30 2011] : <b>(8593) Alan</b>: <font color='#612769'>(Isn't it? But how else are you going to get the effect? In the novels, you can just narrate it. In real life, you have to make your own coincidence.)</font><br />
[Sat Jan 15 19:49:46 2011] : <b>(8579) Renate</b>: <font color='#000080'>(bah)</font><br />
[Sat Jan 15 19:50:14 2011] : <b>(8581) Rien</b>: <font color='#263607'>(Rien could always not approach it and instead take a seat and beckon it over.)</font><br />
[Sat Jan 15 19:51:05 2011] : <b>(8593) Alan</b>: <font color='#612769'>(People respect something that fits a narrative.

[Sat Jan 15 19:52:24 2011] : <b>(8579) Renate</b>: <font color='#000080'>(Indeed. It's not her style at all.)</font><br />
[Sat Jan 15 19:52:25 2011] : <b>(8593) Alan</b>: <font color='#612769'>Dark Eternal is wearing his human guise, an old man with shoulder-length white hair, a bushy beard, and an eye patch. The imagery taps into several deep veins of respect, beginning with old age itself and ending with the not-so-subtle allusion to the one-eyed Uriel.</font><br />
[Sat Jan 15 19:52:45 2011] : <b>(8593) Alan</b>: <font color='#612769'>He's gazing off into the sunrise, hands clasped contemplatively behind his back.</font><br />
[Sat Jan 15 19:53:05 2011] : <b>(8593) Alan</b>: <font color='#612769'>The illusion is really quite good; Rien's magical senses can't detect it as such.</font><br />
[Sat Jan 15 19:54:03 2011] : <b>(8593) Alan</b>: <font color='#612769'>By the way, if Rien stops a distance away and waits, or makes hand gestures or whatever, eventually a passive ward will note him and signal Dark Eternal to make his appearance.</font><br />
[Sat Jan 15 19:54:13 2011] : <b>(8579) Renate</b>: <font color='#000080'>"Goodbye," Renate says. "Good luck." After a moment, she stands on tiptoe to kiss Rien's cheek, before she walks steadily away.</font><br />
[Sat Jan 15 19:54:18 2011] : <b>(8593) Alan</b>: <font color='#612769'>To someone who isn't in on the trick, it would seem like Dark Eternal was simply biding his time.</font><br />
[Sat Jan 15 19:54:56 2011] : <b>(8581) Rien</b>: <font color='#263607'>Rien watches her go, then turns back to the illusion and sighs, taking the direct route of marching up to it and saying, "this is really an old, cheap trick father.  It's unworthy of you."</font><br />
[Sat Jan 15 19:55:49 2011] : <b>(8581) Rien</b>: <font color='#263607'>(And RIen would have said 'father' with inveted commas clicking into place around it.)</font><br />
[Sat Jan 15 19:59:00 2011] : <b>(8593) Alan</b>: <font color='#612769'>"I thought, to you, the illusion would just be a sort of placeholder. 'Insert Dark Eternal here.' Still came off as pretentious, did it? My apologies."</font><br />
[Sat Jan 15 19:59:28 2011] : <b>(8593) Alan</b>: <font color='#612769'>At least he was paying attention; he "stepped" into place not a half-second after Rien spoke.</font><br />
[Sat Jan 15 20:00:29 2011] : <b>(8593) Alan</b>: <font color='#612769'>"You have no reason to believe me, and no reason to take these comments in the spirit I intend, but it <i>is</i> good to see you, and I <i>am</i> proud of how you've grown."</font><br />

[Sat Jan 15 20:09:40 2011] : <b>(8581) Rien</b>: <font color='#263607'>I must think of some banter in the meantime.</font><br />
[Sat Jan 15 20:10:30 2011] : <b>(8593) Alan</b>: <font color='#612769'>BTW, I've said before that DE will offer to let Rien in on his Big Secrets in exchange for an unbreakable promise that Rien won't reveal them.

[Sat Jan 15 20:12:06 2011] : <b>(8593) Alan</b>: <font color='#612769'>I don't think Rien is the type to be able to make such a promise, simply because he knows he wouldn't uphold it, and DE would sense Rien's uncertainty.</font><br />
[Sat Jan 15 20:12:44 2011] : <b>(8593) Alan</b>: <font color='#612769'>But if Adrian decides Rien can make that promise, then I as DM would hold Rien to it. It's definitely a Jodinesque bargain.</font><br />

[Sat Jan 15 20:14:10 2011] : <b>(8593) Alan</b>: <font color='#612769'>In the Zion game, Ander was distinctly separate from mankind and even the rest of the party, so he took the bargain and went on to calmly fight against Dark Eternal without breathing a word of what he knew.
