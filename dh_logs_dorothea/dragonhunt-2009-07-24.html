[Fri Jul 24 22:17:51 2009] : <b>(1460) Alan</b>: <font color='#000080'>The room grows cool, but then an acolyte brings a new sack of coal for the brazier; Aryk grows thirsty, and finds an acolyte beside him with a pitcher of water. After some hours, another arrives with a small plate of crusty bread, hard sheep's milk cheese, and dried fruit.</font><br />
[Fri Jul 24 22:18:34 2009] : <b>(1460) Alan</b>: <font color='#000080'>The same acolyte neatly sweeps away the crumbs, leaving the hallowed surfaces of the catacomb as spotless as before.</font><br />
[Fri Jul 24 22:19:48 2009] : <b>(1460) Alan</b>: <font color='#000080'>Aryk is left to read the history and draw his own conclusions. The elder knights occasionally sit across from him, but do not respond to any offers of conversation or pleas for insight.</font><br />
[Fri Jul 24 22:20:45 2009] : <b>(1460) Alan</b>: <font color='#000080'>(The history covers most of the key points of Chapter 15, but with an emphasis on the genesis, suppression, and resurgence of the so-called Human Church.)</font><br />
[Fri Jul 24 22:21:26 2009] : <font color='#008000'>** (1459) Aryk <font color='#008000'>tries to absorb as much knowledge as possible.  Never one for books, he gets frustrated often, but he presses on.</font> **</font><br />
[Fri Jul 24 22:23:31 2009] : <b>(1460) Alan</b>: <font color='#000080'>There are accounts from many sources -- Aryk is reading from books written by humans and the few renegade elves who founded the order -- detailing acts of heroism, martyrdom, and even shameful infamy by the members of the fledgling church.</font><br />
[Fri Jul 24 22:25:21 2009] : <b>(1460) Alan</b>: <font color='#000080'>But the key theme that emerges is of humans attempting to live up to a moral code inspired by the angels, but not handed down by them. One particular account tells of a group of scribes and scholars who rewrote large portions of the scriptures.</font><br />
[Fri Jul 24 22:26:03 2009] : <b>(1460) Alan</b>: <font color='#000080'>They told the public they were correcting errors of translation that had crept in over centuries of hand-copying; but privately, and in these memoirs, they admitted the truth: they were altering the scriptures to better match their own beliefs.</font><br />
[Fri Jul 24 22:26:56 2009] : <b>(1459) Aryk</b>: <font color='#710000'>Two years ago Aryk would have disbelieved this information.  Aryk today accepts it easily.</font><br />
[Fri Jul 24 22:27:25 2009] : <b>(1460) Alan</b>: <font color='#000080'>And when they presented the new scriptures to the archangels, less than a week after the suicidal apotheosis of the elven race, the archangels read them, nodded solemnly, and said, "yes -- this new wording expresses our intent much more clearly. You have done well."</font><br />
[Fri Jul 24 22:29:44 2009] : <b>(1460) Alan</b>: <font color='#000080'>The other theme that emerges is of the elves using angels as tools; as "assists" or "summons," in the jargon of the day. In the earlier parts of the memoirs, written even before the Human Church movement began, the elven priests seem to wield tremendous power over their spirits; later, they are horrified to find their commands disobeyed.</font><br />
[Fri Jul 24 22:31:01 2009] : <b>(1460) Alan</b>: <font color='#000080'>The final chapters tell of the long underground period of the church, for the first hundred-odd years after the Second Dragon War (the war among the dragons to see who would rule the newly-conquered world, and which ended with Rubylith's banishment).</font><br />
[Fri Jul 24 22:31:42 2009] : <b>(1460) Alan</b>: <font color='#000080'>During the first 150 years, the church members gathered in basements and hidden burrows, spoke in codes, recognized one another by special colors or ways of wearing accessories.</font><br />
[Fri Jul 24 22:32:03 2009] : <font color='#008000'>** (1459) Aryk <font color='#008000'>asks about that to the elder knight across the table, only to get no response.  He "hmphs" and goes back to reading.</font> **</font><br />
[Fri Jul 24 22:32:29 2009] : <b>(1460) Alan</b>: <font color='#000080'>Not because they feared dragon repression -- in fact, the dragons immediately issued amnesty for all mortals who fought on any side of the war.</font><br />
[Fri Jul 24 22:33:17 2009] : <b>(1460) Alan</b>: <font color='#000080'>Instead, they hid from the dragons because they feared dragon control: the scaly hands of power would inevitably come to clutch angelic throats, as dragon money and dragon political power swayed the balance of worship and sacrifice.</font><br />
[Fri Jul 24 22:33:39 2009] : <b>(1460) Alan</b>: <font color='#000080'>They had good reason: this began to happen almost immediately with the demon, chaos, and faerie churches.</font><br />
[Fri Jul 24 22:34:41 2009] : <b>(1460) Alan</b>: <font color='#000080'>But in a major counter-movement which began around 130 DR, the leaders of all the planes presented a united front: they would not endorse any dragon above another, as long as no dragon attempted to control them in turn. Quite a switch for Whirlwind Lionheart, who had made his name as the first dragon backer.</font><br />
[Fri Jul 24 22:36:12 2009] : <b>(1459) Aryk</b>: <font color='#710000'>"Hmph."</font><br />
[Fri Jul 24 22:36:18 2009] : <b>(1460) Alan</b>: <font color='#000080'>The dragons accepted the pact; but it was never elevated to the status of Accord, which left every dragon free to deal with any spirit reckless enough to defy the common agreement.</font><br />

[Fri Jul 24 23:48:01 2009] : <b>(1460) Alan</b>: <font color='#000080'>"That is a very good question. Personally, I would dearly like to watch Adam summon the powers he says he has. I want to perceive them with my own senses, and maybe then I will know what to think."</font><br />
[Fri Jul 24 23:49:17 2009] : <b>(1460) Alan</b>: <font color='#000080'>"Unfortunately, he does not seem likely to come visit us. His Aspect Knights have expanded their ranks to include ex-churchmen of... both sides. It is unclear exactly what he is planning to do with them."</font><br />

[Fri Jul 24 23:50:59 2009] : <b>(1460) Alan</b>: <font color='#000080'>"I can't see how it is possible, or how he could even think it is possible."</font><br />
[Fri Jul 24 23:52:30 2009] : <b>(1459) Aryk</b>: <font color='#710000'>"I don't know either.  I will not wage physical war on the Church, Father.  And... if that's what he's going to do, then I'll stop him."</font><br />
[Fri Jul 24 23:52:58 2009] : <b>(1460) Alan</b>: <font color='#000080'>"As for my own thoughts about the True King? Though he has never granted me any revelation, or made his presence known to me, I believe he exists; how could I not? I see evidence of him in everything that is good in this world."</font><br />
[Fri Jul 24 23:52:59 2009] : <b>(1459) Aryk</b>: <font color='#710000'>"A war of words, ideals, beliefs... well, I can't make any promises there."</font><br />

Cast myself as the victim and victor at once."</font><br />
