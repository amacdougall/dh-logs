	It's hot. Sticky-hot. Really, really hot. It's also lunchtime, in spite of the heat. The air is so thick one could almost put a straw in it and drink it. Ilium is dragging a bit, it's so hot; the wet air muffles the weldon boxes, and the streets are quiet. Still, neither rain nor sleet nor wringing heat keeps the winner of the Saffold-Marman Invitational from his daily lunch crowd.

	After another night under the oak tree, Aryk snuck himself into the temple to clean up, and now he heads over to Carragio's for some food. He walks into the white-hot expanse of Berthold Square, mirage-ripples rising from the pavement. Someone is talking to Carragio, back turned toward Aryk. Someone familiar. He has to look twice, but -- yes, it is! Short, blonde, a long curved sword strapped to her back -- it *is* Renate!

	It takes all of his willpower to keep from barrelling into her. She can hear his footsteps not a few meters away as he races toward her. She turns quickly, dropping into a fighting stance -- and then *she* barrels into *him*, all but knocking him over. "Aryk! Oh, saints and angels, it's so good to see you!"

	Aryk throws his arms around her and hoists her up and twirls her, all in one blindingly fast motion. "It is you! It is you!" He squeezes tightly. "Never... ever ever ever do that again!" He plants a big kiss on her cheek.

	She kisses him right back. "I'm sorry, I'm sorry -- I was *such* a mess, and I never thought you'd forgive me, and... oh, I missed you!"

	"I missed you too, Rennie." After a long hug he sets her down. 

	"Definitely a case of Reunion Ragout!" Carragio proclaims, reaching for a pannikin of sauce. "The world is my heatstone today, and good things are cooking!" 

	Aryk flashes a smile at the chef. Laughter bubbles out of Renate, lighter by far than the heavy air. "Well, we've given Berthold Square a show, haven't we?"

	"Huh? Oh... yeah, I guess we have. Oh well."

	She takes his arm, properly this time. "It doesn't matter. Why *shouldn't* I be glad to see you, after all?"

	"Exactly. So... are you here to stay? Don't tell me you actually think I'm going to let you run off again."

	"Well, um... we'll talk about that. I've got a job. You can probably come with, though; always room for one more on this kind of thing. But I'm not running away from you again, if that's what you're asking."

	"Okay. Well, I guess you could say I'm still more or less unemployed... and I'd love to come with... but... if all goes well, I was going to hook up with the Purgatory tour, actually. And uh... I was going to ask you to come with me!" Renate stares at him, jaw dropping. Then she starts laughing again, laughing until she has to take off her sunglasses to wipe her eyes. "What? What's so funny?"

	"Well, I'd say that was a good sign, Sir Aryk," Carragio says, handing over two boxes of savory-smelling stew. "You take her down to the park and eat these."

	"Just... the world... it's so funny sometimes," Renate gasps, replacing her sunglasses. "I'll explain... when we get there. Thanks, Carragio." They walk sedately toward Bevier Park, keeping to the shady side of the street. "But a funny world is better than a terrible one," Renate opines with satisfaction.

	"Yeah, that's true." Aryk samples his food while they walk.

	Renate just chuckles. Once they find themselves a park bench in the shade of a willow, she says, "All right, Aryk, here's what's funny. My job? Is security for the Purgatory tour. I'm with Coris's team."

	"Wha'... no way. Really? That's awesome! How'd you land that gig?"

	"Coris landed it, actually, and I invited myself along before he could think better of it. What are *you* doing with them?"

	"Well... I'm trying to work a deal right now... to be the opening act, actually." Aryk smiles. Renate can tell he's anxious.

	"No... kidding?" Her eyes widen, then narrow. "Hm. This have anything to do with Dorothy Durai?"

	"Heh... not anymore, it doesn't."

	"How about you tell me the whole story here, hm?"

	"Well... I'll have to start with Emily. I... met Emily again."

	"Oh, you *did*? She's all right, then? That's good."

	"Yeah, she's great. She was concerned with Dorothy Durai opening up for Purgatory... you know, with her track record and all. She the two of us, well, it was her idea, but we struck a deal with Hermit that if we 'convinced' Durai not to join the tour, I could fill in for the opening act."

	"O-ho. I see. I'm guessing I don't want to inquire too closely into the precise nature of your convincing?"

	"Well, let's just say she's alive and in one piece, and relatively unscathed. She wasn't happy about it, but she wouldn't listen to reason, so I had to use 'aggressive negotiations.' It was the first time I had to get rough with a girl. I didn't enjoy it much, really."

	"Oh, Aryk. Girls are human. It's not a distinction that matters much, when it comes down to roughness. 

	"No, I guess not. I still didn't like it much."

	"Besides, I bet Emily can hold her own in that regard."

	"Yeah, Emily..." Aryk sighs. Renate raises an eyebrow, and peers at Aryk over the rims of her glasses. "Emily and I sort of hooked up. But... she had to leave again. Ricard's still really pissed off at me over that whole thing, but he's getting over it."

	"Oh." Renate chews on that a little, along with a mouthful of stew. "I don't understand why Ricard would object. I mean, it was mutual, right? You didn't... force her or anything?"

	"Oh, heavens no!" Aryk nudges her shoulder. "C'mon! No... it... well, he said that since we weren't sure of where her allegiances lie and all, that I should be careful, and he just kept yammering away... and... well, I sort of banished him for a bit."

	"You *did*? Oh." She is clearly wondering how much to say. "So... you and Ricard are still kind of on the outs? Sounds like it got bad."

	"We're alright now. He lectured me for a good 24 hours straight. And well, lately he's sort of been my only link to, well... all that is holy, more or less, so we've been talking a lot."

	Ricard pops up out of thin air, just his face, a sort of misty cloud. "It's good to see you again, Renate. Aryk has missed your guidance."

	"Hello, Ricard," she answers, with a respectful nod. "I wouldn't give two chips for my guidance, personally, but I appreciate your vote of confidence. Um, is it true, what Aryk just said? He got mad at you and banished you because you lectured him about Emily?"

	"I was only looking after his best interests. Miss Rani was... coming onto him, and he was not thinking clearly."

	"I don't understand. What's wrong with Emily?"

	"As Aryk said, I know little of Emily Rani, including what faith she has devoted herself to. I was also put off by the fact that she was uncomfortable having my presence around as they... did... whatever it was they did."

	"Oh, come on, Ricard, it wasn't like that!" Aryk pipes up.

	"Oh. I... think I see now. Um, I think I wish my guidance was better than I suspect it's going to be." She takes a deep breath. "Emily didn't want Ricard around, is that it, then?"

	Ricard gives Aryk a knowing, and almost "I told you so" look and dissipates with a "Goodbye for now, Renate."

	Aryk shakes his head. "Well, would you want an angel watching you if you were gonna make out with some guy?"

	"Ricard is part of your soul, isn't that right? If I were -- in love with someone, I'd want all my soul there, I think. But that's me. What about you? Are you going to keep sending Ricard away when you meet Emily? Are you going to lock him out of this part of your life?"

	"No, no. I think Emily is just a bit uncomfortable around that part of me for the moment. She's not a follower of the Sacred Alliance, you know? I can't hold that against her. You've taught me, Rennie, that I need to look past those things... to find the good in all people. And I see nothing but good in Emily..." Aryk pauses. "Well, except those weird comments she makes sometimes."

	"Such as?"

	"Heh... well, sometimes she likes to mention world domination and stuff, and she can be... a bit graphic when talking about violence... but... it's nothing to worry about." Aryk's not so sure of himself on that last part.

	Renate puts her hand on his shoulder. "Sounds like you've had a rough time with this," she says sympathetically. "It's all right to be unsure, you know. And it's all right if she's not perfect." She shakes his shoulder playfully. "'Cuz, I have to say, neither are you! But, look, the three of you need to work out this exclusion thing. Ricard's important to you, Emily's important to you. Ricard and Emily need to learn to accept each other, I think, if this is going to work. And I'd like it to. For all of you."

	Aryk chuckles. "All right, all right. I know what you mean. I know. And next time I see Emily... whenever the blazes that is... I'm going to address that. She's just so damn secretive, you know?"

	"She's afraid, I guess. So is Ricard. I think so are you, a little. But you can get through that, if you try." Renate shrugs. "Besides, women are freaky. Ask Coris."

	Aryk nods, and thinks for a few moments. "Well, look, anyways, enough about all that. What about Coris?" Aryk tries to catch a gleam in her eye at the mention of Coris's name.

	There isn't one. She sighs. "Well, he was the one who got me to go home, after Tarlochen. I was going to talk to my trainer, you know? Because he can usually put my head back on straight. But he wasn't there, like I said in my letter."

	"Right."

	"And I guess I just wigged out even worse, not having *anybody* to lean on. I was... pretty seriously lunatical, tell you the truth. I don't like to think about it."

	Aryk puts his arm around her shoulders. "Hey, it's cool. I was pretty depressed and stuff for a while too."

	"Yes. That was bad. Really bad." She shakes herself a little. "So I, um, tried to reach out a little to Coris, because to *really* tell you the truth I've had a crush on him since I was sixteen... and I needed somebody, I *really* did... but he, um, was a little wigged himself at my total wiggitude. Not that I blame him. Life's hard enough; who needs a crazy woman?"

	"I'm sorry, Rennie. Listen... we're together again. We can keep each other from wigging out. And... when you get your head straight, which is sounds to me like you're just fine, go and bag yourself that Mr. Nightblade. Hey, do you think he'd mind if I used his name in a rap?"

	"Er... I'm not sure. You could ask him."

	"All right. I'll do that. Sorry to get off subject. Anyway..."

	"*Anyway*, no, there won't be any Nightblade-bagging. I blew it. I forfeited his respect. He's not interested, and that's his perfect right."

	"You're too hard on yourself, sis. You're a good catch, and you refuse to see it."

	"Well, so it goes sometimes." Renate changes the subject with an audible wrench. "Um, what kind of material are you thinking of using, if you land the opening spot?"

	Aryk grinned. "Damn, I nearly have a whole album's worth of stuff ready to go. Which is good, because I think I wanna put out an album."

	"Really? Cool!"

	"I don't think I want to do this all the time, but... I've got a lot of things to say, you know? I have all the usual stuff, you know, talking about how cool I am... and I talk about my faith, and how it's been tested, and what I've learned. I talk about you a lot. And my friends from school. ...And Rien." Aryk says his name with a bit of emphasis. "I'm writing a song for Emily right now. Oh, and I talk a lot of shit about dragons."

	"Rien," Renate repeats softly.

	"Yeah, that's right. I brought it up." Aryk takes his arm off Renate's shoulder and looks at her squarely with a look of thoughtfulness.

	"I think I made myself clear on that subject." But she can't meet his eyes.

	"Well, yes and no. You told me how you felt. You told me that you don't feel like you can trust him. You told me that honestly, you don't think that he's an evil person, but that the potentiality of him being one is just too great." Aryk doesn't avert his look.

	"Yes, that's what I said, more or less. Except I didn't quite say that I didn't think he was evil. I said that I didn't know. The Rien part of him... that might have been just pasted on over... over something that would do deals with Dark Eternal. Rien wasn't evil. But I don't know about that other part."

	"So you're not willing to give the good part a chance? Do you know what I think Rien is doing right now? I think he's going out and trying to sort himself out. I think he's trying to do the same thing we've been doing since Tarlochen."

	"That's what Carragio says. Apparently Rien did some pretty serious wigging himself. I sent Leonid after him; took him *days* to chase Rien down. But then Rien went right back off again, after Ander Kurtzveil is what Carragio says, and nobody's seen him since that I know of."

	"What that says to me is Rien wants very much to be the good person he knows he is. And I think that he'd like our help. I think he needs it."

	"If he hadn't lied to me, Aryk, I'd be behind that one hundred percent. But he *did* lie, about something he *knew* would matter to me, and because of that lie I had to tell my trainer to *leave home*, because me taking Rien home put him in danger. What else will Rien lie to us about? Whose head goes on the chopping block next time? If it were all past and done... if I were the only one he'd damaged... but it isn't, and I'm not, and the future isn't bright at all."

	"I'll put my head on the chopping block, if it saves his. Rien lied to protect us. Especially you. It was stupid. But it was a mistake, just a mistake. You want the future to be bright? Then we have to do something about it! That's exactly what I said before all this went down! Remember? In the orchard at Karlbotel? What happened to that moment?"

	Renate stares at the pavement a long time, without moving. Finally she says, "I got scared of him. That's what happened. I'm not proud of being scared. But that's how it is. He's just too much for me, Aryk; it's more than I can handle. Did you *see* what he *did*?"

	"Well... yes and no. I was sort of encapsulated in stone from the knees down at the time. I could hear it. I could hear Dark Eternal's voice. I could hear Heartbreaker's agony. But Rennie, that's just it! It was Dark Eternal's voice! Not Rien's! He's a victim in this! He's more scared then both of us together! He needs our help!"

	Renate makes an indistinct sound of pain. "I don't know, Aryk. I don't know. I think -- I think you're right -- but I don't know if I can do this." She takes off her sunglasses to wipe them, closing her eyes. "He's... very like his father, in some ways. Demanding. Devouring. That's why... after Bevier Park... I wouldn't -- he asked me. But I said no. What am I, to either of them? What can I conceivably *do*?"

	Aryk shakes his head. "I don't see the whole devouring thing... but... ah, hell. I can't make you do anything you don't wanna do, sis. But me, I'm willing to give the old boy a second chance. You can do anything you put your mind to, not to be cliche, and I happen to know you have your mind put to the same thing I do."

	"I expect so. And I expect that events will roll right over us and not even realize they've done it. Oh, well. I never got into this game thinking I had any hope of winning it."

	Aryk clears his throat. "Now listen / I've had a premonition
Three warriors will go on a mission
One a noble who likes masochism
A mage night with a persona schism
And the paladin who brings you this vision
The journey will be very hard
The warriors'll travel very far
From Ilium to Andragar
Confrontations lead to battle scars
In the end, this world will be ours
I don't mean we want to dominate
We want to roll the dice / Change our fate
Learn from us / We will demonstrate
What it's like to have a clean slate
Start this world over / I'll elaborate
We've come to end the Dragon's Reign
And to destroy that which is dark arcane
We will bring tranquility again
And while we're at it...
To spread my love for the Sacred Plane
What a difference serenity brings...
Imagine this world where we run things
Instead of dictator reptilians
Who have no right to tell us anything
Who have no right to tell us anything...."

	"...And we can't do it without him, sis."

	Renate listens to him soberly, her eyes behind the dark lenses fixed on his face. "That's pretty good," she says.

	"It's most of the first song on my album."

	"Except for the masochism bit. I don't *like* getting hurt."

	"Heh. No, but you invite it. That was more of a joke than anything."

	She shrugs. "Better me than the people I care about, that's all."

	"Anyway, it rhymed with schism."

	She puts her empty box aside, chopsticks in it, and hugs Aryk gently. "Thanks, bro. I think I needed that."

	He hugs her back warmly. "Sorry, it was kind of lame to just break into song, wasn't it?"

	"Not a bit of it. It's what they do in all the old stories."

	"Yeah, I guess you're right. Listen, let's find Rien again. Not now, but soon. Just to talk. If it's too hard, or you're too afraid, I'll understand, and we can go. I... I just want to know... you know?"

	"Yes. Yes, I know. I'll talk to him. No promises. But I'll talk to him. I -- I'm just not -- it's not going to be easy. I cared about Rien a lot. A *lot* a lot." She lets Aryk go, and slumps until her elbows rest on her knees. "I still do, I guess."

	"I know, Rennie. It wouldn't be this hard if you didn't."

	She glances up at him. "You understand things better than you used to, you know that? Come on, I told Lehron I'd help him out with training this afternoon."

	"One of Coris's boys?"

	Renate stands up, tosses her box unerringly into a waste-can nearby, and holds out her hand to Aryk. "Mm-hm. He's nice, once you get past the quiet. And he's got a lot of quiet to get past. But, um, you and Ricard and Emily? If you need a mediator, I'm it. Because I like you all."

	"Cool. Thanks." Aryk tosses out his box and joins hands with her. "So, you guys have someplace I can crash, I hope?"

	"Oh. You... haven't been back to yours and Rien's place? I mean, I was in the building earlier. It's intact and all."

	"It's felt a bit weird to be there, so I haven't been back. And I'm in this whole 'apprehensive of the church' mood lately, so I haven't been back there much either."

	"Oh. That's too bad. Maybe we can go after training? I wouldn't say no to a chance to pray."

	"Oh, I've still been praying. If anything, I've been praying more lately. Just... not at church."

	She doesn't press him about church. He'll go when he's ready. "Well, you can crash at my place if you want to. I mean, I know it's the same building and all. But he's out of town, best information I have."

	"All right. Yeah, maybe I'll just grab some stuff and sleep on your couch if that's cool."

	"Of course it is. You're my *brother*. And you've got the key and everything, so that's all right. Oh, except wait! New key. Hang on." She fishes a keyring out of her belt-pouch and extracts a key from it for him.

	"Heh. Li'l miss paranoid."

	"Well, I told you I was wigging. And Talos was really sweet about it; his people took care of it for me. Though Godfrey pointed out that a new lock wouldn't make much difference to somebody who could take out a dragon singlehanded."

	"Speaking of Talos.... he hooked me up with a lightwarrior. You'll have to meet her. She's... well, spunky. But nice, and hey, she puts up with me."

	"Her? I didn't think there were any lightwarriors who were 'her's. 'She's. Whatever. Female. But sure, I'd be happy to meet her."

	"Her name's Arretia. You'll like her. One of the best I've ever heard."

	She coming with you on the tour, if you get the gig?" 

	"Yup, she's definitely coming with, whether she knows it or not."

	"Cool. She must be something. It's hard to bust into guys-only spaces."

	"Well she's doing it with a vengeance."

	"Good for her." She turns onto Antonius Boulevard, toward Southtown. "Hey, bro?"

	"Yeah, sis?"

	"I'm really glad you're here."

	"You said it, Rennie. Things just weren't the same without ya."
