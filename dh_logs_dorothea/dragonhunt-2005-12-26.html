[Mon Dec 26 19:20:23 2005] : <B>(1) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>"Magisterial" is one of those adjectives that's only applied to history books.</font><br>
[Mon Dec 26 19:20:34 2005] : <B>(1) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>Kind of like "taut" is only applied to thrillers.</font><br>

[Mon Dec 26 19:21:10 2005] : <B>(2) Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>I like "magisterial." It's a good word.</font><br>
[Mon Dec 26 19:21:13 2005] : <B>(1) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>Not terribly much of one, but sure.</font><br>
[Mon Dec 26 19:21:15 2005] : <B>(1) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>And it is.</font><br>
[Mon Dec 26 19:21:45 2005] : <B>(1) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>It's just that its assimilation into a few specific vocabularies has somewhat mitigated its impact for me.</font><br>
[Mon Dec 26 19:22:47 2005] : <B>(1) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>So, what loose ends have to be wrapped up in Ys? It would be daybreak, after another one of those sleepless hero-nights.</font><br>
[Mon Dec 26 19:23:06 2005] : <B>(1) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>I don't want to have to make too much reference to Garland's luau until I've written it up.</font><br>
[Mon Dec 26 19:23:35 2005] : <B>(2) Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>Well, there's Emily. I have a notion for springing her, actually... but you may want to let Aryk do it. Renate would actually be willing to leave it to him.</font><br>
[Mon Dec 26 19:23:41 2005] : <B>(2) Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>Learning experience for them both.</font><br>
[Mon Dec 26 19:24:22 2005] : <B>(2) Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>Otherwise, I think our Rennie's put enough bees in enough bonnets that the Xanadians can take it from there.</font><br>
[Mon Dec 26 19:24:58 2005] : <B>(2) Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>Mia's body can be left to Artagus for the time being, I think.</font><br>
[Mon Dec 26 19:25:36 2005] : <B>(2) Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>And the crew is exhausted, so I suspect the plan would be coping with Emily, then going back to the inn for bath, breakfast, and bed, in that order.</font><br>
[Mon Dec 26 19:25:59 2005] : <B>(2) Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>And if Garland was expecting Renate at noon (she being the politest person he knows, probably), he'll just have to be disappointed.</font><br>
[Mon Dec 26 19:26:23 2005] : <B>(1) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>He's good at improvisation. Actually, he's deeply uncomfortable with plans.</font><br>
[Mon Dec 26 19:26:36 2005] : <B>(1) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>That could be considered a weakness of his, in fact, though possibly a hard one to exploit.</font><br>
[Mon Dec 26 19:27:01 2005] : <B>(2) Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>Reminiscent of Aryk, actually.</font><br>
[Mon Dec 26 19:27:51 2005] : <B>(1) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>Every time he's tried to come up with ideas ahead of time, he's ended up scrapping them at the critical moment anyway.</font><br>
[Mon Dec 26 19:27:59 2005] : <B>(2) Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>lol!</font><br>
[Mon Dec 26 19:28:27 2005] : <B>(1) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>He literally trusts his instincts and clutch hunches more than he trusts his intellect and wisdom.</font><br>
[Mon Dec 26 19:28:40 2005] : <B>(1) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>So he can't stick to a plan to save his life.</font><br>
[Mon Dec 26 19:29:01 2005] : <B>(2) Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>So all we have to do is set up a situation where if he doesn't stick to the plan he loses his life. Simple.</font><br>
[Mon Dec 26 19:29:11 2005] : <B>(2) Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>Only something Emily will be totally incapable of, I fear...</font><br>
[Mon Dec 26 19:29:21 2005] : <B>(1) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>She's not a big planner either.</font><br>

[Mon Dec 26 19:29:57 2005] : <B>(2) Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>Whereas Renate's starting to feel at loose ends if she doesn't have six plans going at once.</font><br>

[Mon Dec 26 19:30:42 2005] : <B>(1) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>Well, let me turn the log on and you can do your thing.</font><br>

[Mon Dec 26 19:35:16 2005] : <B>(2) Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>She is tired, and her nose is still embarrassingly runny, but some of the exaltation of the fight clings to her still.</font><br>
[Mon Dec 26 19:36:56 2005] : <B>(1) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>Clessgrave has been busily sending reconnaissance angels off along various tunnels leading out of the Fountain of Dawn, seeking out potential threats; but it seems the Red Masks and other Artagite elites have abandoned ship.</font><br>
[Mon Dec 26 19:37:56 2005] : <B>(1) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>She gives you directions to the main courthouse and police complex, just inside the Big Block on its southern side.</font><br>
[Mon Dec 26 19:38:36 2005] : <B>(2) Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>"Thanks. For everything. I don't need to tell you how much I owe you. If you ever want to collect, look me up."</font><br>
[Mon Dec 26 19:39:47 2005] : <B>(1) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>"Right now I just want to collect some juicy comp time."</font><br>
[Mon Dec 26 19:40:12 2005] : <B>(2) Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>"You've earned it." She hitches her sword higher on her shoulders and walks off toward the trolley, trailing one hand against a rusty, half-demolished cast-iron fence.</font><br>
[Mon Dec 26 19:41:17 2005] : <B>(1) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>Aryk is just down the street, talking to a junk dealer. "No, bigger. No, bigger than that. Okay, now sharper. What do you mean, all you have is steel pipes?"</font><br>
[Mon Dec 26 19:42:00 2005] : <B>(2) Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>"Aryk, brother, it is the Church's duty to arm you properly. You needn't pay Clover District prices."</font><br>
[Mon Dec 26 19:42:42 2005] : <B>(1) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>"There's supposed to be a store around here somewhere... it was advertising in the back of a magazine I read. Martial aids?"</font><br>
[Mon Dec 26 19:42:55 2005] : <font color='#008000'>** (2) Renate bites her lip. **</font><br>
[Mon Dec 26 19:43:15 2005] : <B>(1) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>"I mean, I could just mail-order. I think the 'plain brown paper' is to get around arms-smuggling inspections."</font><br>
[Mon Dec 26 19:43:25 2005] : <B>(2) Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>"Just go to the Church. Trust me. Please." Now is not the time to embark on delicate explanations.</font><br>
[Mon Dec 26 19:44:21 2005] : <B>(1) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>"Right. I, uh, well, I'm not sure they'll give me one. Because, er... I guess I <i>am</i> still a knight... I just haven't tested that lately."</font><br>
[Mon Dec 26 19:44:34 2005] : <B>(1) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>"Right." He thumps his chest. "Bravely."</font><br>
[Mon Dec 26 19:44:57 2005] : <B>(2) Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>"If they don't, then we'll work something out. But they will. Thank you, Aryk; you did very well by me this night."</font><br>
[Mon Dec 26 19:45:33 2005] : <B>(1) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>Aryk smiles. "Thanks, sis. You did great too. We're all alive, right? ...er." He grimaces.</font><br>
[Mon Dec 26 19:45:53 2005] : <B>(1) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>"We're all, uh, as alive as we wanted to be." He sighs and walks off.</font><br>
[Mon Dec 26 19:46:19 2005] : <B>(2) Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>"She died free," Renate calls after him gently, before she too goes on her way.</font><br>
[Mon Dec 26 19:47:46 2005] : <B>(2) Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>"The Big Block stop, please," she says as she climbs wearily onto the trolley. She forbears to take a seat, as the morning commuters doubtless will not appreciate the bloodstains from her armor.</font><br>
[Mon Dec 26 19:49:37 2005] : <B>(1) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>Said commuters are aghast, but minding one's own business is a way of life, particularly at the edges of the Clover District.</font><br>
[Mon Dec 26 19:50:11 2005] : <B>(1) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>There are no laws against wearing sheathed weapons, and none against being covered in blood.</font><br>
[Mon Dec 26 19:51:15 2005] : <B>(1) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>The two together definitely raise questions from time to time, and constitute probable cause (insofar as Silver Coast jurisprudence contains the concept), but by chance no lawmen decide to question you on your trip until you reach the police station itself.</font><br>
[Mon Dec 26 19:52:15 2005] : <B>(1) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>"Pardon me, miss," one of the armed main door guards says a moment after you enter the ringing front hall of the police complex.</font><br>
[Mon Dec 26 19:52:24 2005] : <B>(1) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>"You seem to have had a rough time."</font><br>
[Mon Dec 26 19:52:49 2005] : <B>(1) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>His voice is neutral, but several other guards take notice and shift subtly.</font><br>
[Mon Dec 26 19:53:49 2005] : <B>(2) Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>"It could have been worse, all things considered. You may wish to check in with the Marquess -- excuse me, the Riskbreaker captain."</font><br>
[Mon Dec 26 19:53:54 2005] : <B>(1) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>The front hall itself is not a security checkpoint; there are thick-glassed service windows at one end, and a hallway leading into another large room.</font><br>
[Mon Dec 26 19:54:24 2005] : <B>(1) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>That hallway is a security checkpoint; civilians going through are being patted down. Presumably there's a weapon check.</font><br>
[Mon Dec 26 19:55:05 2005] : <B>(1) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>"Which captain?" The guard asks. Another says, "'Marquess' would mean Captain Zweren. Extraordinary Measures."</font><br>
[Mon Dec 26 19:55:21 2005] : <B>(2) Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>"Quite so. I believe she will vouch for me; my name is Renate von Adler."</font><br>
[Mon Dec 26 19:55:35 2005] : <B>(1) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>"Ah, that would explain things. I suppose you'd be a troubleshooter?"</font><br>
[Mon Dec 26 19:55:50 2005] : <B>(1) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>He seems more at ease now that he has an idea why you look like you just came from a battle.</font><br>
[Mon Dec 26 19:55:53 2005] : <B>(2) Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>"Former. Ex. In other words, no. Here on my own recognizance only."</font><br>
[Mon Dec 26 19:56:42 2005] : <B>(1) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>"Well, if you'd have a seat, I'll go check with her."</font><br>
[Mon Dec 26 19:57:01 2005] : <B>(2) Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>"Thank you very much." She tries not to quite fall into the offered seat.</font><br>
[Mon Dec 26 19:58:00 2005] : <B>(1) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>The guard returns after a minute or two, with Captain Zweren in tow. She looks as weary as Renate. "Crazy morning. Spent all night securing churches and locking up priests."</font><br>
[Mon Dec 26 19:58:26 2005] : <B>(2) Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>"Worth your while, I hope. Did you recapture Loricatus?"</font><br>
[Mon Dec 26 19:59:05 2005] : <B>(1) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>"It was a bit of a risk, but once day broke, funniest thing. Riots on every block. Most of those churches would be on fire now."</font><br>
[Mon Dec 26 19:59:27 2005] : <B>(2) Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>"Riots?" Renate sits up straight. "Oh. Damn."</font><br>
[Mon Dec 26 19:59:28 2005] : <B>(1) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>"I bet those diabolists are happy to be in jail now."</font><br>
[Mon Dec 26 19:59:52 2005] : <B>(1) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>"Mild ones," she says. "That's why I got all our people in place. Crowd control."</font><br>
[Mon Dec 26 20:00:28 2005] : <B>(1) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>"I expected something major to happen to the churches of Artagus, so I exercised some authority."</font><br>
[Mon Dec 26 20:01:07 2005] : <B>(1) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>"Come on, I'll show you the reports, and you can tell me just what the heck happened."</font><br>
[Mon Dec 26 20:01:35 2005] : <B>(1) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>"All I know is that all Artagus's powers seem to have disappeared, and once people realized that, they marched on the churches to smash them."</font><br>
[Mon Dec 26 20:01:37 2005] : <B>(2) Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>Renate sighs. "I expect you've managed well. I hope I haven't implied otherwise. Yes, let's go, by all means." She offers the front-door guards a tired half-bow as she passes them.</font><br>
