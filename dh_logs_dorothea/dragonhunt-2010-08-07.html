[Sat Aug  7 18:29:03 2010] : <b>(666) Renate</b>: <font color='#000080'>"Still. It was ugly. I don't want to do that again."</font><br />

[Sat Aug  7 20:28:37 2010] : <b>(664) Alan</b>: <font color='#3d0079'>"For a year or so, I thought it would be a good idea to go out and win supporters. If I could just show that I had enough backing, the Church would have to accept that there might be some truth in what I said. Then I realized, after a little showdown with an inquisitor named Zalmo, I realized that just having supporters was worse, in a way. Then I'm not just some guy... I'm the head of a cult."</font><br />
[Sat Aug  7 20:30:10 2010] : <b>(664) Alan</b>: <font color='#3d0079'>"By then, I'd already started the Aspect Knights. That's part of what forced the issue. This Zalmo, he saw me as the head of an armed band of rogue paladins. Which, well, I can't blame him. We were out there having adventures, trying to do good, hunting down the 'forces of evil.' Classic loose cannons."</font><br />
[Sat Aug  7 20:30:56 2010] : <b>(664) Alan</b>: <font color='#3d0079'>"So that's when I broke up the Aspect Knights, told them to be knights errant. Go out there, do good, but don't band together. Try to stand as paragons of virtue all by yourselves, spread the word, but be examples."</font><br />
[Sat Aug  7 20:32:03 2010] : <b>(664) Alan</b>: <font color='#3d0079'>"So then I thought, well, if I can just show the Church that when we pray to the True King, and it's in a good cause, it gets answered. But of course, if your prayers are only answered in times of true need... you can't just walk into a cathedral and say, 'okay, try to kill me so I can show off.'"</font><br />
[Sat Aug  7 20:33:18 2010] : <b>(664) Alan</b>: <font color='#3d0079'>"So I went around and did what I told the Aspect Knights to do. I tried to find trouble and put a stop to it. Hoping word would get back to the Church and they would have to investigate. Well, they did, but they didn't come to the conclusions I like. They were positive I was using some kind of trickery to store 'denatured' angelic power and release it on command."</font><br />
[Sat Aug  7 20:33:49 2010] : <b>(666) Renate</b>: <font color='#000080'>"Hm. They do jump to conclusions. Is that even possible?"</font><br />
[Sat Aug  7 20:33:52 2010] : <b>(664) Alan</b>: <font color='#3d0079'>"That was a fair suspicion. I was always good at the technical aspects of divine prayers."</font><br />

[Sat Aug  7 20:36:28 2010] : <b>(664) Alan</b>: <font color='#3d0079'>"Anyway, recently I realized that there was only one thing I could do. Something I should have done in the first place. I had to just go to the College directly and state my case. I'm in a better position, now, because I have a lot more experience, more of a track record, of having prayers to the True King answered... but in a worse position, because I've spent years being a heretic."</font><br />
[Sat Aug  7 20:37:45 2010] : <b>(664) Alan</b>: <font color='#3d0079'>"And I really do <i>not</i> want to get sent to one of their heretic farms.

[Sat Aug  7 20:51:48 2010] : <b>(664) Alan</b>: <font color='#3d0079'>"What I heard from the locals was that Kadokawa used to run the place uncontested.

[Sat Aug  7 20:52:13 2010] : <b>(664) Alan</b>: <font color='#3d0079'>"He would expand every now and then, or shrink every now and then if another dragon muscled in... Patchwork as usual."</font><br />
[Sat Aug  7 20:53:14 2010] : <b>(664) Alan</b>: <font color='#3d0079'>"Then this Shiromachi dragon came down from Maal. Now, you know, Maal is more or less dragon-free, because its dragon ruler kicks out any competitors.

[Sat Aug  7 20:54:19 2010] : <b>(664) Alan</b>: <font color='#3d0079'>"He brought a good-sized gang of hobgoblins and goblins with him, maybe five hundred total.

[Sat Aug  7 20:56:05 2010] : <b>(664) Alan</b>: <font color='#3d0079'>"But I realized that if I got Shiromachi to change his plans a little, maybe things would work out. So I got him to agree that his five hundred would fight Kadokawa's army while I helped undermine it, you know, through the family relations. And then if they ran Kadokawa off, each farmer would accept a share of the goblins in proportion to his amount of land. They'd work the fields side by side, and gradually vest in the farm to become part owners. I hoped by then they'd be like family."</font><br />
