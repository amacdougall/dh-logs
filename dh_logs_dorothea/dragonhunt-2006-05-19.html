[Fri May 19 19:17:47 2006] : <B>(1) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>So I'll lug that over to your place when I get it.</font><br>
[Fri May 19 19:18:24 2006] : <B>(1) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>One sec to pour coffee, and we'll start. Anything you guys want to do before the trip to Karlbotel?</font><br>
[Fri May 19 19:19:55 2006] : <B>(3) Aryk</B>: <font color='#000080'>Sounds good.  Some of the screenshots I saw for that actually made it look pretty entertaining.</font><br>
[Fri May 19 19:20:11 2006] : <B>(2) Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>Um, no. Renate would have sent a telegram from Xanadu as soon as she knew when she'd arrive in Ilium. And she needs to stop off at a leatherworker's in Ilium; doubtless Jashain can recommend someone. Exactly what she's after is mine to know and yours to find out. But it'd be a custom job. :)</font><br>
[Fri May 19 19:20:34 2006] : <B>(1) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>Should I still keep my mind out of the gutter?</font><br>
[Fri May 19 19:20:35 2006] : <B>(3) Aryk</B>: <font color='#000080'>Can't think of anything in particular, no.  I'm going to write up a fluff piece that deals with some of the stuff Aryk does or at least has on his mind during his trip.</font><br>
[Fri May 19 19:20:37 2006] : <B>(2) Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>Oh, and she'll pick up Dorothy from the Veterans' Aid. We'll have to drive a small cart or gig or something back to Karlbotel.</font><br>
[Fri May 19 19:20:43 2006] : <B>(2) Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>:P YES YOU SHOULD.</font><br>
[Fri May 19 19:20:59 2006] : <B>(1) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>Because Jashain could recommend <i>all sorts</i> of people.</font><br>
[Fri May 19 19:21:09 2006] : <B>(2) Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>I'm sure he could. But no, this is soldier stuff.</font><br>
[Fri May 19 19:21:16 2006] : <B>(2) Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>And not off-duty soldier stuff, either.</font><br>

[Fri May 19 19:21:54 2006] : <B>(1) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>You all got my very minor fluff on Soleil and Emmelita Devlin?</font><br>
[Fri May 19 19:22:01 2006] : <B>(2) Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>Yep. Emmelita's cute.</font><br>
[Fri May 19 19:22:14 2006] : <B>(1) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>I swear, I re-read that Soleil one at least seven times trying to strip it of all clues.</font><br>

[Fri May 19 19:22:28 2006] : <B>(1) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>Er, unintentional ones, at least.</font><br>
[Fri May 19 19:22:56 2006] : <B>(3) Aryk</B>: <font color='#000080'>Yeah, it was good.</font><br>
[Fri May 19 19:23:44 2006] : <B>(1) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>Note that despite the parallel, it is not meant to suggest that Sabine is going to go insane and mind dominate Karlbotel.</font><br>
[Fri May 19 19:23:59 2006] : <B>(2) Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>Nah, she's not the type.</font><br>
[Fri May 19 19:24:10 2006] : <B>(3) Aryk</B>: <font color='#000080'>I dunno...</font><br>
[Fri May 19 19:24:12 2006] : <B>(2) Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>And if that happened Renate would kill her sister herself and be a basket case for a month.</font><br>
[Fri May 19 19:24:35 2006] : <B>(1) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>Well, which is what happened to Soleil's client, poor thing. But sometimes it just happens that way.</font><br>
[Fri May 19 19:24:47 2006] : <B>(1) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>Er, not the killing herself, but yeah.</font><br>
[Fri May 19 19:24:53 2006] : <B>(2) Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>I got ya.</font><br>
[Fri May 19 19:25:40 2006] : <B>(2) Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>something like that -- 24/7 suicide watch, and keep Renate away from all sharp objects including sporks.</font><br>
[Fri May 19 19:26:39 2006] : <B>(1) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>Okay, well, let's pick it up in Karlbotel, then, where the mood is distinctly subdued.</font><br>

[Fri May 19 19:28:51 2006] : <B>(1) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>They make hurried trips from house to stable to see to their stock, and there are always a few hardy charcoal burners, tanners, smokehouse tenders, ice fishermen, out and about; and so word spreads by the oldest form of distance communication (the "holler"), that Renate Von Adler has come to visit.</font><br>
[Fri May 19 19:29:57 2006] : <B>(1) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>The Karlbotel holler is a funny thing; its high eerie tones are designed to carry across crazy-quilt farm squares and through hedgerows, and it would be downright un-neighborly not to pass on a holler meant for someone further down the dell.</font><br>

[Fri May 19 19:39:47 2006] : <B>(1) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>His name is Father Marius, and he has been tending to the births and deaths of Karlbotel since long before Renate was born.

And it shows itself different ways, because it <em>has</em> to, they're all different people who need different things of me -- but it's all love, and for me, it all comes from the same place."</font><br>

[Fri May 19 23:20:05 2006] : <B>(1) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>Which is, let Masan Ahim disappear it.</font><br>
[Fri May 19 23:20:15 2006] : <B>(1) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>Without letting even Masan know what it is.</font><br>
[Fri May 19 23:20:18 2006] : <B>(2) Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>Hm. That's not a bad thought.</font><br>
[Fri May 19 23:20:38 2006] : <B>(1) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>Put it in a lead-lined antimagic case and get it hurled into a network of trusted but very secretive contacts.</font><br>
[Fri May 19 23:20:59 2006] : <B>(2) Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>She had stopped at the leatherworker's to make a concealing scabbard for it, one that would hold another sword on top of it.</font><br>
[Fri May 19 23:21:06 2006] : <B>(2) Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>But this is probably a hell of a lot safer.</font><br>
[Fri May 19 23:21:30 2006] : <B>(2) Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>And yes, as much as she depends on that thing, it's giving her the creeps.</font><br>
[Fri May 19 23:21:33 2006] : <B>(1) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>There's a whole system, Masan says, for concealing things like that, and the system was designed by artificers a century or so ago to withstand government purges, mass executions, warfare, and so forth.</font><br>
[Fri May 19 23:21:52 2006] : <B>(2) Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>Plus she's never quite felt like it was hers.</font><br>
[Fri May 19 23:21:56 2006] : <B>(1) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>It has a paper trail and everything, so even if a few contacts die or are "got", you can still track down your items.</font><br>
[Fri May 19 23:22:02 2006] : <B>(3) Aryk</B>: <font color='#000080'>But wouldn't it be nice to be able to use it when you really needed it?</font><br>
[Fri May 19 23:22:12 2006] : <B>(1) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>Note that if you DO need it suddenly, getting it back would be a whole subquest.</font><br>
[Fri May 19 23:22:28 2006] : <B>(2) Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>Yeah, but you know Renate -- she doesn't blink at disadvantage.</font><br>
[Fri May 19 23:22:37 2006] : <B>(1) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>But I can assure you that no malign force would be able to just snatch it up.</font><br>
[Fri May 19 23:22:57 2006] : <B>(1) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>Specifically, none of the big players like Dark Eternal or Soleil -- not saying Soleil's necessarily malign.</font><br>
[Fri May 19 23:23:12 2006] : <B>(1) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>But he is among the people who might be interested in the sword if they knew what its deal was.</font><br>
[Fri May 19 23:23:52 2006] : <B>(2) Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>I need to think that one over. I *do* want Renate to be seen with a different sword, but I'm not sure I want CL all that far distant.</font><br>
[Fri May 19 23:24:11 2006] : <B>(2) Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>It may depend on how closely the sword is associated with her (and with her family) in public consciousness.</font><br>
[Fri May 19 23:24:38 2006] : <B>(1) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>If the sword is advantageous to other people -- and I'll tell you that, at least potentially, it is -- it might also be useful to Renate.</font><br>
[Fri May 19 23:24:48 2006] : <B>(2) Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>Nobody's made a big deal out of it yet, but that doesn't mean they didn't notice it.</font><br>
[Fri May 19 23:25:04 2006] : <B>(1) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>Well, there's no wrong choice here. Just different types of complications. :)</font><br>
[Fri May 19 23:25:06 2006] : <B>(2) Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>Well, but if this is a game of keepaway, then the obvious thing to do is give it to Masan.</font><br>
[Fri May 19 23:25:14 2006] : <B>(2) Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>Heh, yeah, figures.</font><br>
[Fri May 19 23:25:42 2006] : <B>(2) Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>Then I guess it comes down to whether she needs it as a (metaphorical) crutch.</font><br>
[Fri May 19 23:26:13 2006] : <B>(1) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>She may not feel it's hers, but at this point, she wouldn't give it to Will if he asked.</font><br>
[Fri May 19 23:26:16 2006] : <B>(1) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>I assume.</font><br>
[Fri May 19 23:26:29 2006] : <B>(2) Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>Nope. Not her choice. If the Baron said to, she would.</font><br>
[Fri May 19 23:26:44 2006] : <B>(2) Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>If Will tried to take it without the Baron's say-so, she'd fight to the death to keep it.</font><br>
[Fri May 19 23:27:39 2006] : <B>(2) Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>See, the thing is, if Will isn't to see through this subterfuge, he can't know that she's still got the weapon.</font><br>
[Fri May 19 23:28:16 2006] : <B>(2) Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>So that makes me lean toward giving it to Masan, because it's Ankoku's investigative potential she wants to wave red herrings in front of.</font><br>
[Fri May 19 23:28:18 2006] : <B>(1) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>Well, depending on how serious you want th disownment, she could seem to have run off with it.</font><br>
[Fri May 19 23:28:43 2006] : <B>(2) Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>Ah, interesting. Though potentially full of complications. Not least people going "but she wouldn't DO that!"</font><br>
[Fri May 19 23:29:00 2006] : <B>(1) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>Or Will saying "hey, I'm going to have to take that."</font><br>
[Fri May 19 23:29:02 2006] : <B>(2) Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>A simple disinheriting makes a lot more sense.</font><br>
[Fri May 19 23:29:04 2006] : <B>(2) Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>Right.</font><br>
[Fri May 19 23:29:05 2006] : <B>(1) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>And having an actual right.</font><br>
[Fri May 19 23:29:10 2006] : <B>(2) Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>Double right.</font><br>
[Fri May 19 23:29:42 2006] : <B>(2) Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>Yep, I guess I don't see how she can keep it, then.</font><br>
[Fri May 19 23:30:04 2006] : <B>(2) Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>Though giving it up will be as big a disadvantage as getting trained by that dragon in Sune (which, yes, I am seriously considering).</font><br>
[Fri May 19 23:30:37 2006] : <B>(2) Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>Although, dammit, I don't think Will has ANY right to do anything on behalf of Karlbotel, no matter what he's up to with Aaron.</font><br>
[Fri May 19 23:30:44 2006] : <B>(2) Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>Color me traditionalist or something.</font><br>
[Fri May 19 23:31:04 2006] : <B>(1) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>Well, more of that will be revealed in due time.</font><br>
