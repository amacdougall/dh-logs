[Sat Jun  5 20:05:05 2010] : <b>(8303) Alan</b>: <font color='#00008c'>Hey guys! Tell me the advisability of meeting my ex-girlfriend at a local bar to discuss being friends!</font><br />
[Sat Jun  5 20:05:13 2010] : <b>(8303) Alan</b>: <font color='#00008c'>Adrian's got a driving lesson, right?</font><br />
[Sat Jun  5 20:05:17 2010] : <b>(8307) Rien</b>: <font color='#263607'>Low.</font><br />
[Sat Jun  5 20:05:26 2010] : <b>(8303) Alan</b>: <font color='#00008c'>So we started an hour earlier and end an hour earlier.</font><br />
[Sat Jun  5 20:05:39 2010] : <b>(8302) Renate</b>: <font color='#000080'>Ah, right-ho.</font><br />
[Sat Jun  5 20:05:43 2010] : <b>(8307) Rien</b>: <font color='#263607'>I say this from my extensive experience of being friends with exes.  It largely hasn't worked out.</font><br />
[Sat Jun  5 20:05:53 2010] : <b>(8302) Renate</b>: <font color='#000080'>I'm friends with one of my exes.</font><br />
[Sat Jun  5 20:06:12 2010] : <b>(8303) Alan</b>: <font color='#00008c'>Yeah. She texted me, though. I guess I'll find out. I haven't really tried it before! I'm Facebook friends with one ex, the semi-famous one.</font><br />
[Sat Jun  5 20:06:35 2010] : <b>(8303) Alan</b>: <font color='#00008c'>But when we've met in person since then, it's generally been unfortunate.</font><br />
[Sat Jun  5 20:06:40 2010] : <b>(8305) Aryk</b>: <font color='#800000'>Garbage Day.</font><br />
[Sat Jun  5 20:06:41 2010] : <b>(8303) Alan</b>: <font color='#00008c'>In... one way or another.</font><br />
[Sat Jun  5 20:07:46 2010] : <b>(8302) Renate</b>: <font color='#000080'>One meeting won't kill you. I say go for it.</font><br />
[Sat Jun  5 20:07:47 2010] : <b>(8305) Aryk</b>: <font color='#800000'>She's setting you up for more heartbreak.  If you like what's going on with the neuroscientist, don't do it.</font><br />
[Sat Jun  5 20:08:05 2010] : <b>(8303) Alan</b>: <font color='#00008c'>I am absolutely 100% not breaking things off with Leah.</font><br />
[Sat Jun  5 20:08:25 2010] : <b>(8305) Aryk</b>: <font color='#800000'>If it were me, I would tell her it's Garbage Day.</font><br />
[Sat Jun  5 20:08:32 2010] : <b>(8307) Rien</b>: <font color='#263607'>Is Leah the type to wonder why you're meeting a relatively recent ex at a bar, though?</font><br />
[Sat Jun  5 20:08:33 2010] : <b>(8303) Alan</b>: <font color='#00008c'>If Megan suggests something more than casual rapprochement, I'm not down for it.</font><br />
[Sat Jun  5 20:09:04 2010] : <b>(8305) Aryk</b>: <font color='#800000'>BTW, I posted that video on Facebook.</font><br />
[Sat Jun  5 20:09:35 2010] : <b>(8303) Alan</b>: <font color='#00008c'>Not that I know of. Not that I plan to volunteer the information. I don't expect to be hanging-out-regularly friend to Megan anyway. I'm a fan of being "cool with" her though.</font><br />
[Sat Jun  5 20:09:56 2010] : <b>(8302) Renate</b>: <font color='#000080'>Yep.</font><br />
[Sat Jun  5 20:10:20 2010] : <b>(8303) Alan</b>: <font color='#00008c'>I have zero plans to respark anything with Megan. She's leaving in July and resettling in D.C. in October, anyway. So why would I, even if I wanted to?</font><br />
[Sat Jun  5 20:12:12 2010] : <b>(8305) Aryk</b>: <font color='#800000'>I signed myself up voluntarily for heartbreak once.</font><br />
[Sat Jun  5 20:12:19 2010] : <b>(8305) Aryk</b>: <font color='#800000'>It was stupid.</font><br />
[Sat Jun  5 20:12:53 2010] : <b>(8303) Alan</b>: <font color='#00008c'>Yeah, I'm not into the whole love-triangle thing. I quit Megan for reasons which still hold up perfectly in retrospect. I mishandled it, but I wasn't wrong.</font><br />
[Sat Jun  5 20:12:59 2010] : <b>(8302) Renate</b>: <font color='#000080'>I trust you not to be an idiot, Alan. Go see her.</font><br />
[Sat Jun  5 20:13:04 2010] : <b>(8303) Alan</b>: <font color='#00008c'>So if she wants to at least reconcile, I'm cool with that.</font><br />
[Sat Jun  5 20:14:14 2010] : <b>(8303) Alan</b>: <font color='#00008c'>And Leah is pretty awesome, so I'm not worried about my fidelity.</font><br />
[Sat Jun  5 20:15:01 2010] : <b>(8305) Aryk</b>: <font color='#800000'>Maybe I'm just playing devil's advocate here, but don't do it.</font><br />

[Sat Jun  5 20:16:17 2010] : <b>(8305) Aryk</b>: <font color='#800000'>But I'll leave it at that so as not to risk Dorothea tearing me a new one.</font><br />
[Sat Jun  5 20:17:34 2010] : <b>(8302) Renate</b>: <font color='#000080'>There are legitimate arguments on both sides.</font><br />
[Sat Jun  5 20:17:41 2010] : <b>(8302) Renate</b>: <font color='#000080'>But I do tend to favor giving people a chance.</font><br />
[Sat Jun  5 20:18:56 2010] : <b>(8307) Rien</b>: <font color='#263607'>Just don't be afraid to cut your losses and move on.</font><br />
[Sat Jun  5 20:20:16 2010] : <b>(8303) Alan</b>: <font color='#00008c'>I certainly hope she feels the same way.</font><br />
