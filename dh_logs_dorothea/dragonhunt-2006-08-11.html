[Fri Aug 11 19:13:13 2006] : <B>(1) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>Matt, I just made some thai-style catfish that's entirely brilliant. Thailand's answer to catfish's natural flavor is "blitz the hell out of it with herbs and spices," and it really works.</font><br>
[Fri Aug 11 19:13:41 2006] : <B>(1) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>I don't think it would work with a subtler fish, but catfish, which is normally like "goddamn, yes, okay, you're a fish, we get it" ends up blending just right.</font><br>

[Fri Aug 11 19:19:08 2006] : <B>(3) Aryk</B>: <font color='#000080'>Maybe that should be Rien, due to Adrien's temporary absence.</font><br>
[Fri Aug 11 19:19:36 2006] : <B>(2) Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>Plus Rien hates it when people mess with his mind. Understandably so.</font><br>

[Fri Aug 11 19:21:14 2006] : <B>(1) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>Well, okay.</font><br>
[Fri Aug 11 19:21:19 2006] : <B>(3) Aryk</B>: <font color='#000080'>Well, if Alan doesn't mind.</font><br>

[Fri Aug 11 20:42:42 2006] : <B>(4) Aryk</B>: <font color='#000080'>Er, heh heh</font><br>
[Fri Aug 11 20:42:44 2006] : <B>(1) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>Here we go! Everyone ready? I'll bring Renate back up to speed.</font><br>
[Fri Aug 11 20:42:49 2006] : <B>(2) Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>Go for it.</font><br>
[Fri Aug 11 20:42:51 2006] : <B>(1) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>"Of course. Let us begin with a simple example. We are, obviously, within a phantasm of great fidelity; but that does not mean that lesser phantasmal elements cannot be deresolved."</font><br>
[Fri Aug 11 20:42:56 2006] : <B>(1) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>"Here is a phantasm. You have the great advantage, for this exercise, of knowing it for what it is. Furthermore, it has certain key flaws."</font><br>
[Fri Aug 11 20:43:01 2006] : <B>(1) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>"Take this. See if you can detect its flaws. Do not bother with raw perception or logic, though&#8212;its flaws are too minute and specialized for you to discover without special tools and knowledge."</font><br>
[Fri Aug 11 20:43:06 2006] : <B>(1) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>Then you poofed.</font><br>
[Fri Aug 11 20:43:09 2006] : <B>(1) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>Log is on.</font><br>
[Fri Aug 11 20:43:10 2006] : <B>(2) Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>Okay.</font><br>
[Fri Aug 11 20:43:47 2006] : <B>(1) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>"Instead, use the exercises I taught you yesterday, and clear your conscious mind; then, slowly allow yourself to become fully aware of the wood."</font><br>
[Fri Aug 11 20:44:14 2006] : <B>(1) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>"Use all your senses, but do not intentionally analyze their input. Let your instincts do that."</font><br>
[Fri Aug 11 20:44:46 2006] : <B>(1) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>"If you sense that the wood is unreal or flawed, allow that conviction to fill your awareness, but do not attempt to find reasons for it."</font><br>
[Fri Aug 11 20:45:03 2006] : <B>(2) Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>"Yes, Lord."</font><br>
[Fri Aug 11 20:46:05 2006] : <B>(1) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>"If you achieve a certain overbalance of disbelief, the object will deresolve; your mind will be forced to accept the reality of your instinctive senses."</font><br>
[Fri Aug 11 20:46:33 2006] : <B>(1) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>"The result is the same as when you rammed into that imaginary mountainside; the mechanism is almost completely opposite."</font><br>
[Fri Aug 11 20:46:55 2006] : <B>(2) Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>"Just as well," she murmurs, with a hint of humor.</font><br>
[Fri Aug 11 20:47:19 2006] : <B>(2) Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>She holds up one hand, waiting for Forengil to give her whatever object he means to give her.</font><br>
[Fri Aug 11 20:47:57 2006] : <B>(1) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>He places the small board in her hand. (You were around for the board, she just can't see it, right?)</font><br>
[Fri Aug 11 20:48:18 2006] : <B>(2) Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>(Nope, I didn't know it was a board. Could have been anything from driftwood to a carved statue.)</font><br>
[Fri Aug 11 20:49:17 2006] : <B>(2) Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>She turns it over and over, finds the grain with her fingers without trying to shape it, scratches the wood to hear it whisper, smells it to see if it has been treated.</font><br>
[Fri Aug 11 20:49:38 2006] : <B>(1) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>He holds out a hand, and a small wooden board appears in it. It is unfinished but smooth-cut, it could appear in any woodworker's shop as a scrap or a primitive.</font><br>
[Fri Aug 11 20:49:47 2006] : <B>(1) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>(There -- that's the description you missed.)</font><br>
[Fri Aug 11 20:49:52 2006] : <B>(2) Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>(Thanks.)</font><br>
[Fri Aug 11 20:50:47 2006] : <B>(1) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>As Forengil predicted, you cannot find any evident flaw or falseness in the object.</font><br>
[Fri Aug 11 20:50:51 2006] : <B>(2) Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>She knows wood. She learned to carve, as a child... the locket she gave Coris... no. No memory. No assumptions. Only blankness, and a piece of wood.</font><br>
[Fri Aug 11 20:51:26 2006] : <B>(2) Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>"I am trying, Lord. This is not easy."</font><br>
[Fri Aug 11 20:52:59 2006] : <B>(1) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>"It is not; it is a knack&#8212;a common-tongue expression that is directly mirrored in the dragon language as " (there is a very brief musical chord as if from bagpipe drones) ", 'that which cannot be taught.'"</font><br>
[Fri Aug 11 20:53:27 2006] : <B>(2) Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>"So I can, or I can't. Well, I suppose we shall see."</font><br>
[Fri Aug 11 20:53:51 2006] : <B>(1) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>After a minute or two of this, Forengil says, "Let us try another example. The mind cannot dwell for too long on an item without greater meditative discipline than you currently possess."</font><br>
[Fri Aug 11 20:54:06 2006] : <B>(2) Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>"Very well, Lord."</font><br>
[Fri Aug 11 20:54:36 2006] : <B>(1) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>Over the next half-hour, he hands over a child's leather ball, a blade of grass, a china plate, and so on; simple everyday objects, each a 'flawed' phantasm.</font><br>
[Fri Aug 11 20:55:09 2006] : <B>(1) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>And finally, in the note a drinking glass makes when you flick its rim with your nail, you sense the falseness Forengil alluded to.</font><br>
[Fri Aug 11 20:55:57 2006] : <B>(2) Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>"Hm," she says. "That's not --" And then it is not.</font><br>
[Fri Aug 11 20:56:21 2006] : <B>(1) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>There is a moment at which you almost pay conscious attention to that sense; but instead, attentive to Forengil's instruction, you allow the sense of falseness to exist in your mind without criticism.</font><br>
[Fri Aug 11 20:56:50 2006] : <B>(1) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>And then, exactly: the glass ceases to be, the sense impressions melt away like the remnants of a dream and become only a dim memory.</font><br>
[Fri Aug 11 20:57:14 2006] : <B>(2) Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>"Hm," she says again. "Curious."</font><br>
[Fri Aug 11 20:57:31 2006] : <B>(1) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>"The flaws you detected were minute beyond mortal perception. A phantasm with perceptible flaws would never even seem to exist."</font><br>
[Fri Aug 11 20:57:35 2006] : <B>(2) Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>"May I try again, Lord?"</font><br>
[Fri Aug 11 20:57:57 2006] : <B>(1) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>"Yes. We will see if you can get the knack of it. And then, I will tell you something important about these phantasms."</font><br>
[Fri Aug 11 20:58:40 2006] : <B>(1) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>He hands over more objects&#8212;a tenpenny nail, a stalk of wheat, a river-polished stone.</font><br>
[Fri Aug 11 20:59:01 2006] : <B>(1) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>Again, Renate fails to "deresolve" the first few, but the stone rings false, and disappears.</font><br>
[Fri Aug 11 20:59:09 2006] : <B>(1) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>"It requires practice."</font><br>
[Fri Aug 11 20:59:20 2006] : <B>(2) Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>"Most things do, Lord."</font><br>
[Fri Aug 11 20:59:49 2006] : <B>(1) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>"What makes a phantasm so powerful is that although it can be defeated by the subconscious, it also draws its strength from there."</font><br>
[Fri Aug 11 21:00:28 2006] : <B>(1) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>"The caster must have a very strong mental image, in all applicable senses, of the object to be 'created' in your mind..."</font><br>
[Fri Aug 11 21:00:43 2006] : <B>(2) Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>"Is that not a limitation, Lord? Whatever I do not intimately know will almost automatically ring false."</font><br>
[Fri Aug 11 21:00:48 2006] : <B>(1) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>"...but once it is created, its seeming reality is supported by your own understanding that things are real."</font><br>
[Fri Aug 11 21:01:20 2006] : <B>(1) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>"It is unnatural in the extreme to hold up a rock, and say 'this rock does not exist.' And <i>believe</i>."</font><br>
[Fri Aug 11 21:02:05 2006] : <B>(1) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>"And as you grow stronger in the ways of phantasm and illusion, while the unreal grows more vulnerable to your disbelief... the real does too."</font><br>
[Fri Aug 11 21:02:33 2006] : <B>(1) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>"One of the final stages of my students' training is therapy: psychological conditioning reinforcing the existence of a baseline reality."</font><br>
[Fri Aug 11 21:02:54 2006] : <B>(1) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>"Otherwise, you can slowly go insane, asking yourself... how many nesting dolls are there?"</font><br>
[Fri Aug 11 21:03:15 2006] : <B>(1) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>"And in all honesty... that can be a very wise thing to ask."</font><br>
[Fri Aug 11 21:03:24 2006] : <B>(2) Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>"I acknowledge the danger."</font><br>
[Fri Aug 11 21:04:46 2006] : <B>(1) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>"You are learning well. Your swordmaster taught you patterns of thought that benefit you greatly here."</font><br>
[Fri Aug 11 21:05:19 2006] : <B>(2) Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>"Thank you, Lord."</font><br>
[Fri Aug 11 21:05:47 2006] : <B>(2) Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>"If I may inquire, are any of your current students under therapy?"</font><br>
[Fri Aug 11 21:07:00 2006] : <B>(1) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>"Keniuchio and Jodie have advanced to that stage of study. They are my most senior and trusted disciples."</font><br>

[Fri Aug 11 21:09:47 2006] : <B>(1) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>He chuckles. "Justification enough for the therapy. He has his..." his visage flickers for a moment. "He has his own reasons for what he does."</font><br>

[Fri Aug 11 21:11:09 2006] : <B>(2) Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>"I shall have to consult with my compatriots. They are nervous about this, Lord, and somewhat impatient."</font><br>
[Fri Aug 11 21:11:13 2006] : <B>(1) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>(At almost exactly the same time, Aryk notices Jodie get up from her couch, stretch, and wander into the baths.)</font><br>

[Fri Aug 11 22:27:17 2006] : <B>(1) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>"Master Rien is a man of known loyalty, to you and to all his friends. Let us finish our lesson today, while Aryk calms down; then, please confer with him and decide whether to stay or go. I will trust him, given your and Rien's guarantee of his good behavior."</font><br>
[Fri Aug 11 22:27:39 2006] : <B>(2) Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>"As you will, Lord."</font><br>
[Fri Aug 11 22:28:07 2006] : <B>(1) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>"My interest in your dawning abilities is worth a certain risk. I realize you must take that as a concession of power&#8212;a bargaining chip&#8212;but please take it also as a compliment."</font><br>
[Fri Aug 11 22:29:08 2006] : <B>(1) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>"Until Jodie returns, I cannot make any serious decisions. Her input is very important to me. So if you will, let us find a way to maintain hospitality for two more days."</font><br>
[Fri Aug 11 22:29:21 2006] : <B>(2) Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>"I shall endeavor."</font><br>
[Fri Aug 11 22:31:20 2006] : <B>(1) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>"Let us conclude this lesson, then, with a change of pace." He leads Renate through some simple mental projection exercises, creating her own extremely simple phantasms. They evaporate as they appear, being completely unbelievable even to her, but Forengil says that they are one of the first elements of other mental abilities.</font><br>
[Fri Aug 11 22:31:47 2006] : <B>(1) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>Simply practice in consciously projecting thoughts or consciousness.</font><br>
[Fri Aug 11 22:34:08 2006] : <B>(1) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>Once Renate achieves some basic control over the facility, Forengil nods. "Excellent. Please, if you go to the room directly across the hall, you will find Aryk. If you can convince him to stay peacefully for another few days, we can come to a more conclusive pass soon."</font><br>
[Fri Aug 11 22:34:39 2006] : <B>(2) Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>"I will try, Lord, and I thank you for your patience." She arises effortlessly from lotus, bows, and departs.</font><br>
[Fri Aug 11 22:34:41 2006] : <B>(1) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>"And if he can restore Kaplan's body to full health, it would be an excellent gesture of good faith."</font><br>
[Fri Aug 11 22:35:24 2006] : <B>(1) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>The door Forengil mentioned opens onto Aryk's wildflower-strewn hilltop; to Aryk, a rectangle of hallway simply appears out of nowhere, with Renate standing in it.</font><br>
[Fri Aug 11 22:35:43 2006] : <B>(2) Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>"Aryk, what in the <em>world</em> do you think you are doing?"</font><br>
[Fri Aug 11 22:36:19 2006] : <B>(4) Aryk</B>: <font color='#000080'>Aryk looks up.  He's sitting atop the hill, looking bored.  "Huh?  Oh... they told you?"</font><br>
[Fri Aug 11 22:36:50 2006] : <B>(2) Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>"Forengil showed me an image of you viciously beating an unconscious Kaplan."</font><br>
[Fri Aug 11 22:36:59 2006] : <B>(2) Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>"Was he lying to me?"</font><br>
[Fri Aug 11 22:38:20 2006] : <B>(4) Aryk</B>: <font color='#000080'>"I only jabbed him once.  Then I elbowed dropped him.  I wouldn't exatly call it 'vicious.'  Look, I don't even know if I'm talking to you know, or some image of you that they're projecting into my brain, trying to get answers or something.</font><br>
[Fri Aug 11 22:38:45 2006] : <B>(2) Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>Renate sighs. "Your mother came on to Rien when we visited. Good enough?"</font><br>

[Fri Aug 11 22:39:35 2006] : <B>(4) Aryk</B>: <font color='#000080'>"Hmm... Could be.  Could be.  But they could have read my mind to know that.  But screw it, I'll say it anyway, because whether I do or not, they probably already know what I know that they know anyway."</font><br>
[Fri Aug 11 22:40:39 2006] : <B>(2) Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>"Aryk, hold the tellstone a moment, all right?"</font><br>
[Fri Aug 11 22:40:52 2006] : <B>(4) Aryk</B>: <font color='#000080'>"Salisbury is being controlled.  At least some of the time.  I saw Ralph change personalities at least twice, and the last time he was trying to talk to me like they probably figured I would feel comfortable for him to talk to me, like.  All ghetto, and stuff, and... what?"</font><br>
[Fri Aug 11 22:41:06 2006] : <B>(2) Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>"I need you to promise me. No more unprovoked violence."</font><br>
[Fri Aug 11 22:41:16 2006] : <B>(2) Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>"Or I get kicked out of school."</font><br>
[Fri Aug 11 22:42:52 2006] : <B>(4) Aryk</B>: <font color='#000080'>"Hang on a sec.  Jodie left all of the sudden.  Ralph questioned her... and then he changed again.  She had what I was lead to believe as tissue samples in her bag.  Said it was for some medical reason.  Not sure if I buy it.  I wanted answers, is all.  I never wanted to kill anyone.  You know that.  But I think we're dealing with some seriously evil people, here."</font><br>
[Fri Aug 11 22:43:29 2006] : <B>(2) Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>"You think? I thought it was your business to know. <em>Do</em> you know?"</font><br>
[Fri Aug 11 22:43:54 2006] : <B>(4) Aryk</B>: <font color='#000080'>"I don't know what I know.  I know I'm not really on this hill.  That's about it."</font><br>
[Fri Aug 11 22:44:31 2006] : <B>(2) Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>"Right. Two days. Give me two days, Aryk, without unprovoked attacks on unconscious people, and then I can try to get you off this hill."</font><br>

[Fri Aug 11 22:47:58 2006] : <B>(4) Aryk</B>: <font color='#000080'>Aryk looks around.  "Nope.  Better leave me on the hill.  I go back there, I'm gonna start some more shit.  Rennie, sis, I love you, and I want you to learn everything you can.  But I want you to be more than careful.  I want you to dive into those supernatural senses so much that you figure out exactly what's going on here, AND you learn what you came here to.  As for me, I'm too paranoid.  I won't be able to trust them.  Matter of fact, just tell them to leave me some coffee and a pillow, and I'll just take the hill, thanks, if it's all the same to them."</font><br>

[Fri Aug 11 22:51:32 2006] : <B>(4) Aryk</B>: <font color='#000080'>"Don't give me that.  Most people in this world can't even aspire to accomplish what you already have, and you're still young.  You can have your two days, sis.  Take a week, if you have to.  I know Rien will take good care of us.  Me, I'm gonna... stop and smell the rose..."</font><br>

[Fri Aug 11 22:53:21 2006] : <B>(4) Aryk</B>: <font color='#000080'>"Sure.  Why not?  Fair enough.  So long as I can summon Ricard.  He's not too thrilled about this whole place, either."</font><br>
[Fri Aug 11 22:54:12 2006] : <B>(2) Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>"Agreed." Renate calms herself, takes Aryk's hand, and pronounces the mental cantrip that should return them to the room with its cots.</font><br>

[Fri Aug 11 22:56:47 2006] : <B>(4) Aryk</B>: <font color='#000080'>Sorry if I screwed up your session, Alan, but honestly, I think I'm on to something.</font><br>
[Fri Aug 11 22:57:01 2006] : <B>(2) Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>Because Renate was going to take a little walk with Rien and/or Aryk and then admit that she's SCARED OUT OF HER FREAKIN' WITS.</font><br>
[Fri Aug 11 22:57:19 2006] : <B>(4) Aryk</B>: <font color='#000080'>Oh, Aryk' freaked, too.</font><br>
[Fri Aug 11 22:57:20 2006] : <B>(2) Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>Oh, you definitely found some clues, Matt.</font><br>
[Fri Aug 11 22:57:24 2006] : <B>(4) Aryk</B>: <font color='#000080'>He wouldn't have done that, otherwise.</font><br>

[Fri Aug 11 22:57:32 2006] : <B>(4) Aryk</B>: <font color='#000080'>Good.  Good stuff, then.</font><br>
[Fri Aug 11 22:57:34 2006] : <B>(1) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>It prompted Keniuchio to give Aryk the scoop.</font><br>
[Fri Aug 11 22:57:39 2006] : <B>(3) Mike</B>: <font color='#000080'>Me too! For what it's worth!</font><br>
[Fri Aug 11 22:57:54 2006] : <B>(2) Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>As for Renate, she's trying to keep them a) interested in her, and b) underestimating her.</font><br>
[Fri Aug 11 22:58:02 2006] : <B>(4) Aryk</B>: <font color='#000080'>Yeah, and that's one of those scenarios where I wish I chose to play a smart character.</font><br>
[Fri Aug 11 22:58:04 2006] : <B>(4) Aryk</B>: <font color='#000080'>heh heh</font><br>
[Fri Aug 11 22:58:05 2006] : <B>(1) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>Aryk should find a way to convey his vision to Renate. You'd be able to start coming up with some real theories.</font><br>
[Fri Aug 11 22:58:09 2006] : <B>(2) Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>It seems to have worked for the Grandmaster. :)</font><br>
[Fri Aug 11 22:58:29 2006] : <B>(2) Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>Well, what's a walk in the brisk cold outside for? :)</font><br>
[Fri Aug 11 22:58:34 2006] : <B>(4) Aryk</B>: <font color='#000080'>He will.  Next session.</font><br>
[Fri Aug 11 22:58:57 2006] : <B>(2) Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>Well, I floated a theory at Alan. Apparently he didn't think much of it.</font><br>
[Fri Aug 11 22:59:08 2006] : <B>(1) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>I just didn't say much about it.</font><br>
[Fri Aug 11 22:59:12 2006] : <B>(2) Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>heh</font><br>
[Fri Aug 11 22:59:24 2006] : <B>(2) Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>poor Ren; she's right to be scared, I think</font><br>
[Fri Aug 11 22:59:52 2006] : <B>(2) Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>she's not goin' back in without a serious prayer to Lyria</font><br>
[Fri Aug 11 23:00:08 2006] : <B>(2) Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>because ugh, bodily violation is bad enough; mental violation is intolerable</font><br>

[Fri Aug 11 23:00:56 2006] : <B>(2) Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>Yeah, I got that bit.</font><br>
[Fri Aug 11 23:01:03 2006] : <B>(4) Aryk</B>: <font color='#000080'>That much, at least, I think we've figured out.</font><br>
[Fri Aug 11 23:01:09 2006] : <B>(2) Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>She is going to be COMPLETELY WIGGINS.</font><br>

[Fri Aug 11 23:02:13 2006] : <B>(2) Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>But Renate has excellent self-control when she has to.</font><br>
