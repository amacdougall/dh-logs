[Fri Feb 16 19:06:54 2007] : <B>(1) Alan</B>: <font color='#000000'>Oh, hey. You know, it's not in the top of my head anymore. Let me try to recall.</font><br>
[Fri Feb 16 19:07:24 2007] : <B>(1) Alan</B>: <font color='#000000'>I seem to recall it was stuff that was Flash-based. Ah, right... the styling didn't work because you weren't using a component theme that supported the styles you needed.</font><br>

[Fri Feb 16 19:14:41 2007] : <B>(1) Alan</B>: <font color='#000000'>But that's because my next project is late in arriving. I hope the deadline gets pushed back to compensate.</font><br>

[Fri Feb 16 19:17:21 2007] : <B>(1) Alan</B>: <font color='#000000'>It also lets you put implicit ORs in switch statements:</font><br>

[Fri Feb 16 19:22:39 2007] : <B>(1) Alan</B>: <font color='#000000'>Is it because of the crop troubles?</font><br>

[Fri Feb 16 19:35:07 2007] : <B>(1) Alan</B>: <font color='#000000'>Log is on.</font><br>
[Fri Feb 16 19:35:21 2007] : <B>(2) Rien</B>: <font color='#004000'>(Except that Renate's on the phone)</font><br>
[Fri Feb 16 19:35:47 2007] : <B>(3) Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>(back)</font><br>
[Fri Feb 16 19:36:21 2007] : <B>(1) Alan</B>: <font color='#000000'>The liquid light from Rien's sword paints the mine tunnel walls with white; but at its limit the dark takes greedy hold. You walk in a bubble, down a corridor carved to fit three abreast.</font><br>
[Fri Feb 16 19:37:55 2007] : <B>(1) Alan</B>: <font color='#000000'>This is no mine shaft anymore, really; even before you found the den of conspirators, the carved earth had taken on a more ancient aspect, cruder in toolmarks but more exacting and painstaking in execution; built for the ages, proof against casual cave-in.</font><br>
[Fri Feb 16 19:38:41 2007] : <B>(1) Alan</B>: <font color='#000000'>Small scratches mar the floor and walls, grooves running the direction of travel; on closer examination, they are not gouged but melted into the stone. The mark of generations of watchworms.</font><br>
[Fri Feb 16 19:39:43 2007] : <B>(1) Alan</B>: <font color='#000000'>Your direction sense, as well as you can tell underground, has you travelling toward the fortress; if the tunnels continue, you will pass under the front line at the ravine.</font><br>
[Fri Feb 16 19:39:48 2007] : <font color='#008000'>** (3) Renate finds them convenient paths for her cane. **</font><br>
[Fri Feb 16 19:41:22 2007] : <B>(1) Alan</B>: <font color='#000000'>After a time, the tunnel splits, and splits, and splits again, forming a webwork of tunnels and rounded rooms. Now, here and there, ancient bones or petrified nests tell of the history Junichiro only hinted at, when the fortress held half-starved remorhaz in reserve as last-ditch warhounds.</font><br>
[Fri Feb 16 19:41:43 2007] : <B>(3) Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>"Still following the map?" Renate asks Rien.</font><br>
[Fri Feb 16 19:41:50 2007] : <font color='#008000'>** (2) Rien walks close to Renate, observing all around him, "interesting form of construction." **</font><br>
[Fri Feb 16 19:42:15 2007] : <B>(1) Alan</B>: <font color='#000000'>It is no labyrinth, because you can easily choose a direction and maintain it; but still the many parallel tunnels and rooms provide plenty of hiding spaces.</font><br>
[Fri Feb 16 19:42:34 2007] : <B>(1) Alan</B>: <font color='#000000'>And so, when Rien begins to sense magic in the air again, it is not entirely a surprise.</font><br>
[Fri Feb 16 19:43:40 2007] : <B>(1) Alan</B>: <font color='#000000'>The magic has an alien tinge; it has the tang of the Faerie Realm about it, just as the four final curses of Yves did not seem like natural earthly magic.</font><br>
[Fri Feb 16 19:44:14 2007] : <font color='#008000'>** (2) Rien narrows his eyes and taps Renate on the shoulder to stop her. **</font><br>
[Fri Feb 16 19:44:28 2007] : <B>(3) Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>She immediately halts.</font><br>
[Fri Feb 16 19:44:43 2007] : <B>(1) Alan</B>: <font color='#000000'>The magic is strong enough for Rien to sniff it out by direction, but it is fading.</font><br>
[Fri Feb 16 19:45:01 2007] : <B>(2) Rien</B>: <font color='#004000'>Rien points the direction out, and starts off again quickly.</font><br>
[Fri Feb 16 19:46:08 2007] : <B>(3) Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>"What's going on?" she whispers, following him as quickly as she can.</font><br>
[Fri Feb 16 19:46:51 2007] : <B>(2) Rien</B>: <font color='#004000'>"Magic, Fae, strong, but fading."</font><br>
[Fri Feb 16 19:47:15 2007] : <B>(1) Alan</B>: <font color='#000000'>The light of the sword washes forward across blackened stone, and Rien sees the first charm just in time to stop short: it is a figurine of a man, wrought of twisted and folded paper, propped in the middle of the hall.</font><br>
[Fri Feb 16 19:47:41 2007] : <B>(3) Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>"Whose?"</font><br>
[Fri Feb 16 19:48:04 2007] : <B>(1) Alan</B>: <font color='#000000'>Occultists can fortify a 'desmesnes,' a faerie sanctum in which their power is magnified; and many types of physical charms can act as wards.</font><br>
[Fri Feb 16 19:48:26 2007] : <B>(2) Rien</B>: <font color='#004000'>"I don't know," he says softly as he bends to examine the figurine; all without touching it, of course.</font><br>
[Fri Feb 16 19:48:40 2007] : <B>(1) Alan</B>: <font color='#000000'>This one is easily Sliced through, if Rien wishes, but if passed without caution, it could have any number of ill effects.</font><br>
[Fri Feb 16 19:48:52 2007] : <B>(3) Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>"It's not my Lady's," Renate says with certainty. "I would know. She would tell me."</font><br>
[Fri Feb 16 19:49:29 2007] : <B>(2) Rien</B>: <font color='#004000'>A Slice later, he continues to follow the thread of magic.</font><br>
[Fri Feb 16 19:49:54 2007] : <B>(1) Alan</B>: <font color='#000000'>Clarification: teleporting past it won't work, because it exists in the Mirror Realm too. Are you dispelling it?</font><br>
[Fri Feb 16 19:50:08 2007] : <B>(2) Rien</B>: <font color='#004000'>Yep</font><br>
[Fri Feb 16 19:50:13 2007] : <B>(1) Alan</B>: <font color='#000000'>You could also look for a way around it with one of the other tunnels, but they're probably all warded.</font><br>

[Fri Feb 16 19:50:30 2007] : <B>(3) Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>wait, you are?</font><br>
[Fri Feb 16 19:50:34 2007] : <B>(2) Rien</B>: <font color='#004000'>And it would take time in which the magic could fade completely.</font><br>
[Fri Feb 16 19:50:39 2007] : <B>(3) Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>oh, we can't get past it?</font><br>
[Fri Feb 16 19:50:50 2007] : <B>(1) Alan</B>: <font color='#000000'>Okay. As Rien's ethereal blade cuts the paper doll's magic apart, the doll comes to life, clutching its chest in operatic death throes before bursting into flames and falling to ash.</font><br>
[Fri Feb 16 19:50:54 2007] : <B>(2) Rien</B>: <font color='#004000'>It'd be akin to leaving an enemy behind you.</font><br>

[Fri Feb 16 19:51:58 2007] : <B>(1) Alan</B>: <font color='#000000'>Beyond the sphere of Rien's glowing sword, ghostly blue and pink lights flare into view; pale paper lanterns hanging from the sides of the hall.</font><br>

[Fri Feb 16 22:40:32 2007] : <B>(4) Aryk.</B>: <font color='#a40000'>Heh.</font><br>
[Fri Feb 16 22:40:46 2007] : <B>(1) Alan</B>: <font color='#000000'>Well, now that I think of it, it was a mistake particularly because it's just another obstacle preventing Rien from having a good ending.</font><br>

[Fri Feb 16 22:45:35 2007] : <B>(3) Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>Means "DRAGONS MUST FUCKING DIE."</font><br>
[Fri Feb 16 22:45:40 2007] : <B>(1) Alan</B>: <font color='#000000'>Well, now I wish I'd picked a different overarching theme for the chapter. Mind control does make you doubt your actions, it's true. I was trying to have the chapter end with payback, coupled with the knowledge that the new Accord prevent further dragonic mindgames, and your skills from Forengil make you more immune to mortal mental attacks.</font><br>
[Fri Feb 16 22:45:47 2007] : <B>(4) Aryk.</B>: <font color='#a40000'>Oh, he's much better about that now.</font><br>

[Fri Feb 16 22:46:33 2007] : <B>(1) Alan</B>: <font color='#000000'>And now I feel like I've borked the character arcs.</font><br>

[Fri Feb 16 22:48:06 2007] : <B>(4) Aryk.</B>: <font color='#a40000'>Well, I think Aryk's gotten to the point where he expects these sorts of things to happen.  He knows he has to hang on to the belief that dragons, demonists and so on are going to challenge his newfound belief that there is good in even them, and he has to perservere.</font><br>
[Fri Feb 16 22:48:12 2007] : <B>(4) Aryk.</B>: <font color='#a40000'>He learned that from Renate.</font><br>

[Fri Feb 16 23:06:21 2007] : <B>(1) Alan</B>: <font color='#000000'>Well, I'll work something out, but it'll probably be Shadow-watcher denigrating Seliir's reliability.</font><br>
[Fri Feb 16 23:06:34 2007] : <B>(1) Alan</B>: <font color='#000000'>Because he has his own way of knowing that it was Seliir who gave you the coordinates.</font><br>
[Fri Feb 16 23:07:05 2007] : <B>(1) Alan</B>: <font color='#000000'>It'll turn out the two had a long-standing feud, so you'll have more reason to believe Shadow-watcher than the serpent.</font><br>

[Fri Feb 16 23:15:06 2007] : <B>(2) Rien</B>: <font color='#004000'>Maybe try and make the admin menus a little less sucky.</font><br>
