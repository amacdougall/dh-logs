[Fri Apr 30 18:30:55 2010] : <b>(7074) Alan</b>: <font color='#00008c'>So, everything in this session happens before Carrackshire stuff. Future Dragonhunt historians, take note.</font><br />
[Fri Apr 30 18:31:40 2010] : <b>(7074) Alan</b>: <font color='#00008c'>I haven't written a Margolin travelogue and spy report, because I didn't realize I'd need it. I can give you the upshot, though:</font><br />
[Fri Apr 30 18:32:03 2010] : <b>(7073) Renate</b>: <font color='#000080'>Or you can surprise us. *g* Especially if Ren wouldn't have gotten a copy of the reports.</font><br />
[Fri Apr 30 18:33:16 2010] : <b>(7074) Alan</b>: <font color='#00008c'>Travelogue will say basically the same as Carrackshire: idyllic farmlands, rolling meadows, friendly folk who live an idealized country life. Lots of little recommendations of who to see and what to get, with notes like "(unfortunately, was drawn and quartered after spitting on a dragon conqueror in 1994 -- JM)".</font><br />
[Fri Apr 30 18:33:30 2010] : <b>(7075) Rien</b>: <font color='#263607'>But she would have... the past two went to Aryk and Rien respectively.</font><br />
[Fri Apr 30 18:33:44 2010] : <b>(7073) Renate</b>: <font color='#000080'>ah, very good, then</font><br />
[Fri Apr 30 18:35:21 2010] : <b>(7074) Alan</b>: <font color='#00008c'>The spy report is interesting, though; it says that the entire county was completely destroyed in the great fire, and everyone and everything mentioned in the travelogue is dead or destroyed.</font><br />
[Fri Apr 30 18:36:24 2010] : <b>(7073) Renate</b>: <font color='#000080'>o rly?</font><br />
[Fri Apr 30 18:38:03 2010] : <b>(7074) Alan</b>: <font color='#00008c'>But almost immediately, the ash-covered land was reclaimed by hardy grasses, then ferns, then bushes, then trees.</font><br />
[Fri Apr 30 18:38:06 2010] : <b>(7075) Rien</b>: <font color='#263607'>Please tell me they didn't then mysteriously reappear?</font><br />
[Fri Apr 30 18:38:25 2010] : <b>(7074) Alan</b>: <font color='#00008c'>Not mysteriously, exactly -- the botanical principle of "natural progression" was obeyed.</font><br />
[Fri Apr 30 18:38:46 2010] : <b>(7075) Rien</b>: <font color='#263607'>It takes a long, long time for trees to reclaim anything.</font><br />
[Fri Apr 30 18:38:48 2010] : <b>(7074) Alan</b>: <font color='#00008c'>But the land was not seeded, and the soil should not have been able to support such growth.</font><br />
[Fri Apr 30 18:40:21 2010] : <b>(7073) Renate</b>: <font color='#000080'>Nice trick.</font><br />
[Fri Apr 30 18:40:25 2010] : <b>(7074) Alan</b>: <font color='#00008c'>People came back to the area, and found that the earth was fertile -- dig through a thin layer of ash, and the soil underneath was perfect. Shouldn't be -- couldn't be. But it was.</font><br />
[Fri Apr 30 18:40:44 2010] : <b>(7073) Renate</b>: <font color='#000080'>... what people, incidentally?</font><br />
[Fri Apr 30 18:40:52 2010] : <b>(7074) Alan</b>: <font color='#00008c'>So, led and encouraged by a few corporations -- jinx.</font><br />
[Fri Apr 30 18:41:31 2010] : <b>(7074) Alan</b>: <font color='#00008c'>Led and encouraged by a few corporations from Ilium and Eridu, settlers returned to the area, bringing seeds, saplings, and building materials.</font><br />
[Fri Apr 30 18:42:02 2010] : <b>(7074) Alan</b>: <font color='#00008c'>With the mysterious biological kickstart, and a solid hunk of funding, the county of Margolin was established.</font><br />
[Fri Apr 30 18:43:16 2010] : <b>(7074) Alan</b>: <font color='#00008c'>Politically, this is probably the easiest row to hoe: the county is already under supposedly benevolent rule by the company, and the company was eager to join the official protectorate, pay taxes, get Ilium military support, and so on.</font><br />
[Fri Apr 30 18:43:51 2010] : <b>(7073) Renate</b>: <font color='#000080'>The trick is going to be building a coherent community out of these people, I suspect.</font><br />
[Fri Apr 30 18:44:00 2010] : <b>(7073) Renate</b>: <font color='#000080'>There's no common history or tradition to work from.</font><br />
[Fri Apr 30 18:44:20 2010] : <b>(7073) Renate</b>: <font color='#000080'>And then there's The Company to deal with.</font><br />
[Fri Apr 30 18:44:22 2010] : <b>(7074) Alan</b>: <font color='#00008c'>Renate received a letter in Ilium even before she set out, in which the company manager -- one Dimitri Tell -- expressed his eagerness to have a real ruler instead of his "awkward middle management."</font><br />
[Fri Apr 30 18:44:36 2010] : <b>(7073) Renate</b>: <font color='#000080'>Uh-huh. We'll see about that.</font><br />
[Fri Apr 30 18:44:38 2010] : <b>(7075) Rien</b>: <font color='#263607'>Don't believe him!</font><br />
[Fri Apr 30 18:44:47 2010] : <b>(7074) Alan</b>: <font color='#00008c'>Well, why would you!?</font><br />
[Fri Apr 30 18:45:23 2010] : <b>(7074) Alan</b>: <font color='#00008c'>But since this county is tailored to Renate's abilities, it'll be a case of "align everyone's interests" rather than Aryk's "catch the bad guys" county.</font><br />
[Fri Apr 30 18:45:51 2010] : <b>(7073) Renate</b>: <font color='#000080'>Or "kick out the people whose interests don't align." This also is a possibility.</font><br />
[Fri Apr 30 18:46:04 2010] : <b>(7074) Alan</b>: <font color='#00008c'>Obviously there's plenty of spillover! The mysterious recovery of the land has to be the Grovekeeper's work. Or at least related to him. Good stories can't have <i>that</i> much coincidence.</font><br />
[Fri Apr 30 18:46:22 2010] : <b>(7073) Renate</b>: <font color='#000080'>Yep, but Ren doesn't know about him yet (does she?), so that will remain a Mystery.</font><br />
[Fri Apr 30 18:47:12 2010] : <b>(7074) Alan</b>: <font color='#00008c'>Right. Though if you ask about it, or at least if you ask someone who would be in a position to know, you're sure to get a curiously evasive answer.</font><br />
[Fri Apr 30 18:47:27 2010] : <b>(7075) Rien</b>: <font color='#263607'>They'll probably know that Rien's barony is protected by druids, so it would be reasonable to assume them.</font><br />
[Fri Apr 30 18:47:41 2010] : <b>(7075) Rien</b>: <font color='#263607'>And after a few evasive answers, it would be interesting to come right out and say it.</font><br />
[Fri Apr 30 18:47:59 2010] : <b>(7074) Alan</b>: <font color='#00008c'>Like "so what's with recovering instantly from a devastating forest fire?" "Not immortal Chaos druids of shadowy motivation and uncertain goals! Definitely not!"</font><br />
[Fri Apr 30 18:48:29 2010] : <b>(7073) Renate</b>: <font color='#000080'>Quite.</font><br />
[Fri Apr 30 18:49:01 2010] : <b>(7074) Alan</b>: <font color='#00008c'>I mean, I suppose "make things grow real good" is a motivation. And motivation enough, if you're the kind of guy who'd be a famous centuries-old druid, then rise from the grave as a plant creature.</font><br />
[Fri Apr 30 18:49:16 2010] : <b>(7074) Alan</b>: <font color='#00008c'>I think making things grow is pretty much your whole thing at that point.</font><br />
[Fri Apr 30 18:49:46 2010] : <b>(7073) Renate</b>: <font color='#000080'>The kind of tenacity it takes to have that sort of life, though... that is decidedly unusual.</font><br />
[Fri Apr 30 18:49:55 2010] : <font color='#008000'>** (7074) Alan <font color='#008000'>is not hinting at any Swamp Thing influence. No. Not at all. Never even read it.</font> **</font><br />
[Fri Apr 30 18:50:15 2010] : <b>(7074) Alan</b>: <font color='#00008c'>(Actually I never <i>have</i> read it, but the parallel can't be denied.)</font><br />
[Fri Apr 30 18:50:48 2010] : <b>(7074) Alan</b>: <font color='#00008c'>(We'll see whether I borrowed Alan Moore's plot twist...)</font><br />
[Fri Apr 30 18:52:45 2010] : <b>(7074) Alan</b>: <font color='#00008c'>So, according to the intelligence report, we have Westwood, Murtaugh, Bronze, Laurendale, and Inverness -- yes, that Inverness -- henceforce known as "The Company."</font><br />
[Fri Apr 30 18:53:09 2010] : <b>(7073) Renate</b>: <font color='#000080'>Okay. Renate would have asked Specs for the low-down on them.</font><br />
[Fri Apr 30 18:53:18 2010] : <b>(7074) Alan</b>: <font color='#00008c'>It's not a long-standing corporation; it's a joint venture, in the original sense of a business company, meant to pursue one specific venture.</font><br />
[Fri Apr 30 18:53:26 2010] : <b>(7073) Renate</b>: <font color='#000080'>(Or Masan Ahim, if he's around, though industrial espionage doesn't strike me as his chief talent.)</font><br />
[Fri Apr 30 18:54:31 2010] : <b>(7074) Alan</b>: <font color='#00008c'>Specs is able to pull the public records, since they're registered in Ilium, Eridu, and Atlantis, the homes of the joint founders.</font><br />
[Fri Apr 30 18:55:02 2010] : <b>(7074) Alan</b>: <font color='#00008c'>They're on the up and up. Routine audits didn't find anything odd in their expenditures over the last several years.</font><br />
[Fri Apr 30 18:55:49 2010] : <b>(7074) Alan</b>: <font color='#00008c'>They've been putting a steady but moderate flow of investment into the county, starting with a pump-priming burst at the start of the re-founding of Margolin, and continual payments ever since.</font><br />
[Fri Apr 30 18:55:55 2010] : <b>(7075) Rien</b>: <font color='#263607'>Nor did audits on the Montequido Group</font><br />
[Fri Apr 30 18:56:03 2010] : <b>(7075) Rien</b>: <font color='#263607'>Or we never would have had troubles with them and the Big Noise</font><br />
[Fri Apr 30 18:56:13 2010] : <b>(7074) Alan</b>: <font color='#00008c'>Lots of construction materials, farm equipment, hiring agronomists to act as advisors, and so on.</font><br />
[Fri Apr 30 18:56:43 2010] : <b>(7073) Renate</b>: <font color='#000080'>Okay, so they'll be looking for ROI. Are they planning to divest?</font><br />
[Fri Apr 30 18:56:48 2010] : <b>(7074) Alan</b>: <font color='#00008c'>They've been getting payments back, as crops and local industries start to develop, but they won't break even for another ten years.</font><br />
[Fri Apr 30 18:57:13 2010] : <b>(7074) Alan</b>: <font color='#00008c'>Specs says they haven't been looking for a buyer. Haven't even had a bad year -- their plans are long-term but appear to be working well so far.</font><br />
[Fri Apr 30 18:57:49 2010] : <b>(7073) Renate</b>: <font color='#000080'>Could be worse, I guess. Still, it'd be nice to pay them off and have them gone.</font><br />
[Fri Apr 30 18:58:15 2010] : <b>(7074) Alan</b>: <font color='#00008c'>After five years, according to their own plans, they'll be cashflow-neutral; after ten, they will have made back their total investment. After that, they'll be seeing actual profits.</font><br />
[Fri Apr 30 18:58:46 2010] : <b>(7073) Renate</b>: <font color='#000080'>So they have some kind of an ownership stake, then? This wasn't just a set of loans?</font><br />
[Fri Apr 30 19:00:17 2010] : <b>(7074) Alan</b>: <font color='#00008c'>Their long-term plan involves slowly divesting their holdings after achieving a certain return. The formulas are elaborate, but basically they'll either get three times their money back, or twenty years' profits, whichever comes first, taking into account that Ilium will be taking an increasing cut in taxes as time goes on.</font><br />
[Fri Apr 30 19:00:25 2010] : <b>(7075) Rien</b>: <font color='#263607'>So it wouldn't be a case of paying them off.  You'd have to buy them out at a percentage over.</font><br />
[Fri Apr 30 19:01:47 2010] : <b>(7073) Renate</b>: <font color='#000080'>Phew. Tall order. Okay, we'll see what we have to work with and go from there.</font><br />
[Fri Apr 30 19:02:05 2010] : <b>(7073) Renate</b>: <font color='#000080'>I take it the farm development hasn't hacked off the Grovekeeper yet?</font><br />
[Fri Apr 30 19:02:05 2010] : <b>(7074) Alan</b>: <font color='#00008c'>In addition, each tenant has to pay them a small rent or eventually buy them out. The Company arranged with Ilium that they would own a 10% stake in all land there, while the rest would be parceled out by Ilium's own surveying and development office.</font><br />
[Fri Apr 30 19:02:24 2010] : <b>(7074) Alan</b>: <font color='#00008c'>Truly "unpopulated" land is rare in Northrock -- we're talking about 4000 years of written history here.</font><br />
[Fri Apr 30 19:02:28 2010] : <b>(7073) Renate</b>: <font color='#000080'>Double phew. This is starting to read like the Skye Bridge.</font><br />
[Fri Apr 30 19:03:51 2010] : <b>(7074) Alan</b>: <font color='#00008c'>Not only have people been farming, they've been seeing amazing yields.</font><br />
[Fri Apr 30 19:06:12 2010] : <b>(7073) Renate</b>: <font color='#000080'>Interesting. Perhaps the Grovekeeper is using Margolin as a shield for Birch Creek.</font><br />
[Fri Apr 30 19:06:54 2010] : <b>(7074) Alan</b>: <font color='#00008c'>The intelligence report specifically points out Dimitri Tell, the Company's top manager there; </font><br />
[Fri Apr 30 19:06:58 2010] : <b>(7074) Alan</b>: <font color='#00008c'>William North, the local preacher, no extraplanar affiliation (this is not uncommon in the Patchwork Kingdoms);</font><br />
[Fri Apr 30 19:07:32 2010] : <b>(7073) Renate</b>: <font color='#000080'>So not much magic of any sort locally, Grovekeeper aside?</font><br />
[Fri Apr 30 19:08:25 2010] : <b>(7074) Alan</b>: <font color='#00008c'>Jack Van Kohl, the only blacksmith within twenty kilometers, an Atlantis transplant;</font><br />
[Fri Apr 30 19:10:45 2010] : <b>(7074) Alan</b>: <font color='#00008c'>Nope, no magic. In the initial resettlement, the Company sent some geomancers to help clear stones and erect buildings, but they're all long gone.</font><br />
[Fri Apr 30 19:13:03 2010] : <b>(7074) Alan</b>: <font color='#00008c'>Barbara Stefenhauer, who runs a ginning, spinning, and weaving operation -- the only workshop in the three-county area. They take in wool from all around and produce good-quality fabrics right in Margolin.</font><br />
[Fri Apr 30 19:14:08 2010] : <b>(7074) Alan</b>: <font color='#00008c'>She doesn't work directly for the Company; instead, she has an arrangement with the Company, one in which she apparently has quite a bit of power, to the point where people frequently go to her when they have a problem with the Company.</font><br />
[Fri Apr 30 19:14:18 2010] : <b>(7073) Renate</b>: <font color='#000080'>Aha. Good.</font><br />
[Fri Apr 30 19:15:06 2010] : <b>(7074) Alan</b>: <font color='#00008c'>The Cellar's not sure, but they think she opened her workshop without the Company knowing or planning for it. They just wanted to export raw materials. Then suddenly they have someone right in their front yard buying their raw materials and creating value they don't have a hand in.</font><br />
[Fri Apr 30 19:15:30 2010] : <b>(7073) Renate</b>: <font color='#000080'>If Barbara didn't exist, Ren would have had to invent her. :) And more like her would be EXCELLENT.</font><br />
[Fri Apr 30 19:16:00 2010] : <b>(7073) Renate</b>: <font color='#000080'>Which could be a way to keep her promise to Talos.</font><br />
[Fri Apr 30 19:16:03 2010] : <b>(7074) Alan</b>: <font color='#00008c'>There hasn't been any skulduggery the Cellar's intel guys are aware of, but Specs wants Renate to keep in mind that this is the work of one analyst combining several field reports and financial reports of varying thoroughness. So, you'll have to see for yourself.</font><br />
[Fri Apr 30 19:16:08 2010] : <b>(7075) Rien</b>: <font color='#263607'>Yes.  Local industry is always better than exportation of materiel</font><br />
[Fri Apr 30 19:16:34 2010] : <b>(7073) Renate</b>: <font color='#000080'>Renate reassures Specs that she has every intention of sorting out the lay of the land for herself.</font><br />
[Fri Apr 30 19:16:38 2010] : <b>(7074) Alan</b>: <font color='#00008c'>Well, after they make the cloth, Barbara's company sells it anyway. But at least it's one more step in the vertical value chain.</font><br />
[Fri Apr 30 19:17:04 2010] : <b>(7074) Alan</b>: <font color='#00008c'>It's not like there's a full-on fashion industry in what's still basically a farm town.</font><br />
[Fri Apr 30 19:17:14 2010] : <b>(7075) Rien</b>: <font color='#263607'>Some kind of smithing works would be good, since Carrackshire has no smith, and Birch Creek has nothing of any kind.</font><br />
[Fri Apr 30 19:17:17 2010] : <b>(7074) Alan</b>: <font color='#00008c'>There just happens to be a sixty-person workshop, which is still a powerful little constituency, given the scale of things.</font><br />
[Fri Apr 30 19:17:25 2010] : <b>(7073) Renate</b>: <font color='#000080'>Yes, and it's a start toward an economy that exports value -- and as I read the tea leaves, the Company can't get its grimy mitts on export sales.</font><br />
[Fri Apr 30 19:17:45 2010] : <b>(7073) Renate</b>: <font color='#000080'>Because its stake is in farmland.</font><br />
[Fri Apr 30 19:17:57 2010] : <b>(7074) Alan</b>: <font color='#00008c'>Yes, but keep in mind, metal is hard to come by too. No mines. They have to import it in bar, ingot, and rod form.</font><br />
[Fri Apr 30 19:18:16 2010] : <b>(7073) Renate</b>: <font color='#000080'>Yes, clearly there are industries that won't work here (not least because the Grovekeeper would kick our asses).</font><br />
[Fri Apr 30 19:18:33 2010] : <b>(7073) Renate</b>: <font color='#000080'>But some sorts of artisanry should fit in just fine.</font><br />
[Fri Apr 30 19:18:38 2010] : <b>(7074) Alan</b>: <font color='#00008c'>Which is hard when, especially in the case of Carrackshire and Birch Creek, you don't even have cash currency.</font><br />
[Fri Apr 30 19:20:44 2010] : <b>(7074) Alan</b>: <font color='#00008c'>One of Specs's friends is a political staffer, and Specs asked him to look over the protectorateship agreement; it looks like the Company cedes 100% of police power to Ilium, unconditionally. This is a key point, because up until now, the Company has had a private security force. Not doing much of anything, just a half-dozen guys on mounted patrols, but still.</font><br />
[Fri Apr 30 19:21:23 2010] : <b>(7074) Alan</b>: <font color='#00008c'>One of Renate's first tasks -- as with Aryk actually -- will be to decide how much to try to replace the existing defense arrangements.</font><br />
[Fri Apr 30 19:21:34 2010] : <b>(7073) Renate</b>: <font color='#000080'>Mm-hm.</font><br />
[Fri Apr 30 19:21:48 2010] : <b>(7074) Alan</b>: <font color='#00008c'>The Company police patrol the border watching for signs of brigandry; if they see any, they'll report and the Company will send in some mercs to clear out hotspots.</font><br />
[Fri Apr 30 19:21:54 2010] : <b>(7073) Renate</b>: <font color='#000080'>It may make sense for the three baronies to consolidate defense efforts.</font><br />
[Fri Apr 30 19:22:00 2010] : <b>(7074) Alan</b>: <font color='#00008c'>You can see how it's good for the Company if that's Ilium's problem instead.</font><br />
[Fri Apr 30 19:22:40 2010] : <b>(7074) Alan</b>: <font color='#00008c'>So. Let me check on my stock and then we'll enter Margolin!</font><br />
[Fri Apr 30 19:29:00 2010] : <b>(7074) Alan</b>: <font color='#00008c'>Okay.</font><br />
[Fri Apr 30 19:29:47 2010] : <b>(7074) Alan</b>: <font color='#00008c'>You can tell you've entered the area that was destroyed in the great fire of 1989, because you stop seeing trees.</font><br />
[Fri Apr 30 19:30:26 2010] : <b>(7074) Alan</b>: <font color='#00008c'>Trees are not plentiful in this part of the Patchwork Kingdoms anyway, outside of Herrendon Deep; there are a few copses, a few hedgerows, a few shade trees or orchards.</font><br />
[Fri Apr 30 19:32:43 2010] : <b>(7074) Alan</b>: <font color='#00008c'>But beginning about ten kilometers out from the town of Margolin, there are no trees to be seen at all beyond a few saplings. The farmhouses you can see from the road incline toward covered verandahs or front-yard gazebos; from time to time, a farmer's wife is sitting in the shade, and looks up from her knitting to give a friendly wave.</font><br />
[Fri Apr 30 19:34:04 2010] : <b>(7075) Rien</b>: <font color='#263607'>Rien waves back, murmuring to Renate, "well, that's not a bad sign."</font><br />
[Fri Apr 30 19:34:40 2010] : <b>(7074) Alan</b>: <font color='#00008c'>And, by the same token, everything here is new. Along the way, you'd see fences made of ancient wood, withered and warped by the weather, repaired with fresh planks nailed together inexpertly or lashed together with baling wire.

[Fri Apr 30 20:12:34 2010] : <b>(7074) Alan</b>: <font color='#00008c'>It looks like the people eating lunch at the inn are the "upper crust" of Margolin society, which really just means local business owners.</font><br />
[Fri Apr 30 20:14:04 2010] : <b>(7074) Alan</b>: <font color='#00008c'>Charles's younger brother is a teenager; the gap in age between him and Charles is probably better explained by infant mortality than any special measures on his parents' part.

I've talked enough, though... I'll leave you to it. It's room and board, so any time you go downstairs, grandpa will serve you up some food. I think today he's got cold tomato soup, hot vegetable stew, a few dozen lamb chops packed in ice... he can whip up a dozen types of sauce for macaroni... there's a few heads of lettuce and radishes and things for salad... and of course there's always bread and butter."</font><br />

[Fri Apr 30 20:56:40 2010] : <b>(7074) Alan</b>: <font color='#00008c'>"What do you mean, 'what's really going on?'" North asks.</font><br />
[Fri Apr 30 20:56:48 2010] : <b>(7075) Rien</b>: <font color='#263607'>"I wouldn't consider it my place to explain the mysteries of devotational power.  I am not a believer as you are, so I am not fit to comment on it."</font><br />
[Fri Apr 30 20:57:22 2010] : <b>(7074) Alan</b>: <font color='#00008c'>"Billy, I believe, and you believe, that the True King answers our prayers. But if that's so, then scientific study will prove it. And if it's not, then I need to know that too."</font><br />
[Fri Apr 30 20:58:10 2010] : <b>(7074) Alan</b>: <font color='#00008c'>North nods, stroking his beard. "'Truth is a dangerous skill that ignores faith,' as you always say."</font><br />
[Fri Apr 30 20:59:37 2010] : <b>(7075) Rien</b>: <font color='#263607'>"But do science and faith intersect?  Science has no faith, it is belief-for-now, not believe-through-adversity."</font><br />
[Fri Apr 30 21:00:53 2010] : <b>(7074) Alan</b>: <font color='#00008c'>"Faith is a story you tell yourself to explain why you believe things even without evidence. That's good as far as it goes. But once evidence emerges, if you don't take it into account, you're only hurting yourself," Adam says.</font><br />
[Fri Apr 30 21:02:02 2010] : <b>(7074) Alan</b>: <font color='#00008c'>"I think of 'faith' as a sort of just-so story... not as an immovable rock. There's a good reason for 'faith' as practiced by the Church... it's because people's beliefs influence their angels. But the True King can't be influenced."</font><br />
[Fri Apr 30 21:02:15 2010] : <b>(7074) Alan</b>: <font color='#00008c'>"So faith has no purpose, for me, other than to stop me from thinking."</font><br />
[Fri Apr 30 21:03:07 2010] : <b>(7075) Rien</b>: <font color='#263607'>"So you would be willing, then, to believe whatever I see, despite the fact that I cannot prove it to anyone, since I know not of anyone who sees things as I do."</font><br />
[Fri Apr 30 21:04:52 2010] : <b>(7074) Alan</b>: <font color='#00008c'>"Of course. Because I know that even if you'd have a reason to lie, you wouldn't."</font><br />
[Fri Apr 30 21:06:21 2010] : <b>(7075) Rien</b>: <font color='#263607'>"So it still comes back to faith.  You have to accept the word of a non-believer as evidence to vindicate the faith you hold.  Because, as I said, I can give you no evidence that you can hold in your own two hands."</font><br />
[Fri Apr 30 21:07:31 2010] : <b>(7074) Alan</b>: <font color='#00008c'>"No, no, my friend... that's not faith. It's trust."</font><br />

[Fri Apr 30 21:10:21 2010] : <b>(7075) Rien</b>: <font color='#263607'>Rien bites into the bread, chews briefly, and says, "steam-baking.  Produces a thick, puffed, crispy crust on bread."</font><br />

[Fri Apr 30 21:15:07 2010] : <b>(7073) Renate</b>: <font color='#000080'>"It's impossible to live the life we do and not know more than we ought." Her empty gaze rests a little bit too long on Adam Mayonet.</font><br />
[Fri Apr 30 21:15:20 2010] : <b>(7074) Alan</b>: <font color='#00008c'>"So, my lady," Tell says. "I don't want to talk business until you're settled in, but please let me formally welcome you, on behalf of the whole village. And I mean that.

[Fri Apr 30 21:16:08 2010] : <b>(7073) Renate</b>: <font color='#000080'>"I'm quite surprised anyone has heard of me," is Renate's rejoinder. "I am very grateful for the gracious welcome I have received here."</font><br />

[Fri Apr 30 21:18:32 2010] : <b>(7074) Alan</b>: <font color='#00008c'>"Adam told me you're the best, so I just spread the word to my flock," North says. "That's all there is to it."</font><br />
[Fri Apr 30 21:19:04 2010] : <b>(7073) Renate</b>: <font color='#000080'>Renate bites on the sore spot on her tongue again, briefly. "Well, I'll do my best to live up to the recommendation," she answers softly.</font><br />
[Fri Apr 30 21:19:29 2010] : <b>(7074) Alan</b>: <font color='#00008c'>(Keep that up and you won't be able to enjoy your soup.)</font><br />
[Fri Apr 30 21:20:18 2010] : <b>(7073) Renate</b>: <font color='#000080'>(Yep.)</font><br />
[Fri Apr 30 21:20:36 2010] : <b>(7075) Rien</b>: <font color='#263607'>Rien resists the urge to kick Adam under the table, but while everyone's attention is focused on Renate he does shoot him a look promising they'll talk about this later.</font><br />
[Fri Apr 30 21:20:43 2010] : <b>(7073) Renate</b>: <font color='#000080'>(But Adam just makes her want to slap him. And she can't.)</font><br />
[Fri Apr 30 21:21:56 2010] : <b>(7073) Renate</b>: <font color='#000080'>"So, Master Tell," she changes the subject, "I have been given the outlines of the debt situation here. I'd like to peruse the actual documentation at some juncture, if you please."</font><br />
[Fri Apr 30 21:26:16 2010] : <b>(7074) Alan</b>: <font color='#00008c'>"Oh, of course. You'll find it to be a straightforward share system. The Company financed startup costs for everyone in the area, and has a share in return. The size of the share varies according to a simple formula, increasing over time, but only if the business is profitable. The idea is that for the first ten years, almost all profits can be plowed back into the business as capital investment."</font><br />
[Fri Apr 30 21:26:52 2010] : <b>(7074) Alan</b>: <font color='#00008c'>"Toward the end of the arrangement, the profits should be evenly shared between the business owner and the Company. And then, after the contract ends, the business is fully established and independent."</font><br />
[Fri Apr 30 21:28:02 2010] : <b>(7074) Alan</b>: <font color='#00008c'>"I'm a paper-pusher at heart, my lady, so don't get me started or I'll talk your ear off."</font><br />
[Fri Apr 30 21:28:25 2010] : <b>(7073) Renate</b>: <font color='#000080'>"Yes, that was my understanding, but I should like to understand the fine detail of the arrangement," she says smoothly. "And perhaps you can explain something else to me, quickly. Master Gailand informs me that a manor house is under construction. Who is financing it?"</font><br />
[Fri Apr 30 21:29:36 2010] : <b>(7074) Alan</b>: <font color='#00008c'>"The Company has put up all the construction costs as part of the protectorateship treaty. Can't have a barony without a baronial seat, can we?"</font><br />
[Fri Apr 30 21:30:35 2010] : <b>(7073) Renate</b>: <font color='#000080'>"And those are added to Margolin's general debt load?" Renate asks pointedly. "I'm afraid I cannot assent to that arrangement, Master Tell. I will assume the expenses myself. Kindly have an itemized statement sent me at your earliest convenience."</font><br />
[Fri Apr 30 21:30:44 2010] : <b>(7074) Alan</b>: <font color='#00008c'>"The first year's operating expenses are also covered by the company. After that, the manor budget will be funded by the county's portion of the Ilium Protectorate Authority property tax."</font><br />
[Fri Apr 30 21:31:12 2010] : <b>(7073) Renate</b>: <font color='#000080'>"Unacceptable," she says flatly. "It is my home; I will underwrite it."</font><br />
[Fri Apr 30 21:31:26 2010] : <b>(7074) Alan</b>: <font color='#00008c'>"Oh, heavens no. Consider the manor and its first-year operating expenses part of a dowry, if you will, paid to Ilium as part of the agreement."</font><br />
[Fri Apr 30 21:31:41 2010] : <b>(7073) Renate</b>: <font color='#000080'>"I will do no such thing."</font><br />
[Fri Apr 30 21:31:53 2010] : <b>(7074) Alan</b>: <font color='#00008c'>"Part of the Company's investment, but certainly not a recoupable portion."</font><br />
[Fri Apr 30 21:32:43 2010] : <b>(7073) Renate</b>: <font color='#000080'>"Hmph. I won't be beholden. The statement, if you please, at your <em>earliest</em> convenience. If there is a difficulty with Ilium, I will be glad to resolve the matter with them."</font><br />
[Fri Apr 30 21:33:35 2010] : <b>(7074) Alan</b>: <font color='#00008c'>"Well, I certainly can't argue with you, my lady, so I'll have it sent over by tomorrow morning."</font><br />
[Fri Apr 30 21:34:19 2010] : <b>(7073) Renate</b>: <font color='#000080'>"Thank you, Master Tell. Are there any pressing matters I should be aware of?"</font><br />
[Fri Apr 30 21:36:24 2010] : <b>(7074) Alan</b>: <font color='#00008c'>"Not a one! Everything here has been running like clockwork.
