[Sat Jul 17 18:25:54 2010] : <b>(2047) Alan</b>: <font color='#00008c'>Hah. The classic definition of a troll is someone who posts inflammatory material intended to touch of impassioned responses. A troll does not necessarily use flames (angry internet speech) -- instead, a troll can sound entirely earnest and polite.</font><br />
[Sat Jul 17 18:26:03 2010] : <b>(2047) Alan</b>: <font color='#00008c'>The measure of successful trolling is the flames which appear in response.</font><br />
