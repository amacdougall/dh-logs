[Fri May 14 18:38:37 2004] : <B>(1) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>More punchline than fact... the Church does very very little outright assassination.</font><br>
[Fri May 14 18:39:01 2004] : <B>(2) Dorothea</B>: <font color='#000080'>Well, I think Sabra also has the putting-the-big-picture-together skills. These are very important.</font><br>

[Fri May 14 18:45:33 2004] : <B>(1) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>At least, I don't think so. It'll depend on what you do.</font><br>

[Fri May 14 18:46:17 2004] : <B>(1) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>And although I reserve veto privileges, most fluff is canon by default.</font><br>

[Fri May 14 18:47:14 2004] : <B>(1) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>Adrian, we still have to come up with a version of Rien's "childhood" that gives him at least some sense that Dark Eternal cared to mold him into a competent and wise person... whether or not he succeeded at all.</font><br>
[Fri May 14 18:47:31 2004] : <B>(3) Rien</B>: <font color='#804000'>yes...yes we do</font><br>
[Fri May 14 18:47:36 2004] : <B>(1) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>That rudiment of a father-son relationship is important, even if Rien rejects it or doesn't consider it important.</font><br>

[Fri May 14 18:48:05 2004] : <B>(1) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>After all, from a storytelling perspective, I mean Rien to have at least a faint tie to Andragar that his "father" can exploit.</font><br>

[Fri May 14 18:48:44 2004] : <B>(2) Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>it might be to a tutor or other acquaintance</font><br>
[Fri May 14 18:49:08 2004] : <B>(1) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>Hmm... well, I don't want to give too much away, but I'll share this, and you can brainstorm with me.</font><br>
[Fri May 14 18:49:33 2004] : <B>(1) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>Dark Eternal will offer Rien opportunities few mortals are given, with no strings attached.</font><br>
[Fri May 14 18:49:52 2004] : <B>(1) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>The only "string" would be that the Dragon Council would know Rien has Dark Eternal's favor.</font><br>
[Fri May 14 18:50:13 2004] : <B>(1) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>But those opportunities could be used to combat Dark Eternal&#8212;and DE acknowledges and approves this.</font><br>

[Fri May 14 18:50:32 2004] : <B>(2) Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>you are an evil, evil man, Alan.</font><br>
[Fri May 14 18:50:54 2004] : <B>(1) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>The twisted mentor/father/enemy relationship is one of the loci of Rien's storyline.</font><br>
[Fri May 14 18:51:12 2004] : <B>(2) Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>yeah, that's good crack, all right.</font><br>
[Fri May 14 18:51:12 2004] : <B>(1) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>Another is his struggle to find humanity, which you as players are working at nobly already.</font><br>
[Fri May 14 18:52:13 2004] : <B>(1) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>So do you think Rien has enough background for that to work as is?</font><br>
[Fri May 14 18:52:18 2004] : <B>(2) Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>hm. well. one possibility that comes to mind is that DE took on a mortal persona that young Rien didn't know was DE.</font><br>
[Fri May 14 18:52:24 2004] : <B>(1) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>Without retconning more DE involvement into his tutorship?</font><br>
[Fri May 14 18:52:49 2004] : <B>(1) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>Yes, that was Adrian's idea as well. The question is how we link this visage with Dark Eternal himself.</font><br>
[Fri May 14 18:53:00 2004] : <B>(2) Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>gotcha</font><br>
[Fri May 14 18:53:07 2004] : <B>(1) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>I mean, say Aaron Wrenfall comes out and tells Renate he's actually Dark Eternal&#8212;that doesn't make her well-disposed to him.</font><br>
[Fri May 14 18:53:20 2004] : <B>(3) Rien</B>: <font color='#804000'>Rien could have glimpsed him changing back one day?</font><br>
[Fri May 14 18:53:25 2004] : <B>(2) Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>um, no, that's "immediately draw Crescent Light and try to kill him." *grin*</font><br>
[Fri May 14 18:53:29 2004] : <B>(3) Rien</B>: <font color='#804000'>not long before he left in a panic?</font><br>
[Fri May 14 18:54:00 2004] : <B>(1) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>Ah, and then had to wonder what Dark Eternal was really like, if he could take on a kind and wise personality?</font><br>
[Fri May 14 18:54:05 2004] : <B>(1) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>That could work just fine.</font><br>
[Fri May 14 18:54:15 2004] : <B>(3) Rien</B>: <font color='#804000'>yep</font><br>
[Fri May 14 18:54:21 2004] : <B>(1) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>The idea is that Rien has seen a nurturing side of Dark Eternal that very few others have.</font><br>
[Fri May 14 18:54:58 2004] : <B>(1) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>So he can do the "there is good in him, I can feel it" act, if he so chooses&#8212;or at least have reason to trust DE when DE makes his Faustian offer.</font><br>
[Fri May 14 18:55:32 2004] : <B>(3) Rien</B>: <font color='#804000'>indeed</font><br>
[Fri May 14 18:57:13 2004] : <B>(1) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>That's not to say that he even has to accept it, or even consider it&#8212;there are two or three ways through everything.</font><br>
[Fri May 14 18:57:30 2004] : <B>(2) Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>of course</font><br>
[Fri May 14 18:57:41 2004] : <B>(2) Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>if it weren't a real choice, it'd be no fun at all. :)</font><br>
[Fri May 14 18:57:54 2004] : <B>(2) Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>HOLY. SHIT. though.</font><br>
