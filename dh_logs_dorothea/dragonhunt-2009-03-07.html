[Sat Mar  7 00:07:59 2009] : <b>(23432) Aryk</b>: <font color='#710000'>But I have a Target gift car from X-Mas, so if it's got a decent amount on it maybe I can use that to pick up SF4.  Which as far as I can tell you haven't stopped playing since you got it.</font><br />
[Sat Mar  7 00:08:11 2009] : <b>(23430) Alan</b>: <font color='#000080'>Yeah, I must say I enjoy it.</font><br />
[Sat Mar  7 00:08:26 2009] : <b>(23430) Alan</b>: <font color='#000080'>The online play makes it. If not for that, I would only use it for arcade practice.</font><br />
[Sat Mar  7 00:08:43 2009] : <b>(23430) Alan</b>: <font color='#000080'>But with the online play, I can waste hours and hours battling dudes.</font><br />
[Sat Mar  7 00:08:44 2009] : <b>(23432) Aryk</b>: <font color='#710000'>I thought I told you this?  Remember I was saying how I think I have the power of Mechanical Entropy, and you said I was a goblin or a gremlin or something.</font><br />

[Sat Mar  7 00:08:52 2009] : <b>(23430) Alan</b>: <font color='#000080'>Yeah, yeah!</font><br />
[Sat Mar  7 00:09:05 2009] : <b>(23430) Alan</b>: <font color='#000080'>Well, Street Fighter is just two players at a time. It's a one-on-one combat game.</font><br />
[Sat Mar  7 00:09:17 2009] : <b>(23422) Rien</b>: <font color='#003300'>Still not big on them.</font><br />
[Sat Mar  7 00:09:30 2009] : <b>(23430) Alan</b>: <font color='#000080'>With extremely deep and refined gameplay, but let's not get into that. Even a basic explanation would be long and boring.</font><br />
[Sat Mar  7 00:09:34 2009] : <b>(23422) Rien</b>: <font color='#003300'>Although my housemate keeps trying to get me to play Quake Live.</font><br />
[Sat Mar  7 00:09:35 2009] : <b>(23432) Aryk</b>: <font color='#710000'>I tried playing Soul Calibur like that. It made me never want to play online again.</font><br />
[Sat Mar  7 00:10:06 2009] : <b>(23430) Alan</b>: <font color='#000080'>I can take or leave most online games, but 2D fighting games are one of my favorite things. I don't really know why.</font><br />
[Sat Mar  7 00:11:03 2009] : <b>(23430) Alan</b>: <font color='#000080'>Well, there are some dudes online who completely kick my ass, but when they do, I try to learn from it and improve.</font><br />
[Sat Mar  7 00:11:30 2009] : <b>(23430) Alan</b>: <font color='#000080'>Good fighting games are very precise, lots of very clear cause and effect, so I hardly ever feel like someone won unfairly.</font><br />
[Sat Mar  7 00:12:03 2009] : <b>(23422) Rien</b>: <font color='#003300'>"Cause: I suck at this.  Effect: They win."</font><br />
[Sat Mar  7 00:12:03 2009] : <b>(23430) Alan</b>: <font color='#000080'>They just had better strategy, better immediate tactics, and better reflexes. Probably 30% strategy, 50% tactics, 20% reflexes.</font><br />
[Sat Mar  7 00:12:35 2009] : <b>(23430) Alan</b>: <font color='#000080'>Well, you work your way up in skill. It can be hard to get started, that's true, so you'd need at least a bit of a mentor. Not that you personally are planning to.</font><br />
[Sat Mar  7 00:12:59 2009] : <b>(23430) Alan</b>: <font color='#000080'>It's like getting started at chess, for instance. Knowing how each piece moves is just the start. A good player will always destroy you until you understand the spirit of the game.</font><br />
[Sat Mar  7 00:13:03 2009] : <b>(23432) Aryk</b>: <font color='#710000'>I can't stand it becuase people do the cheapest moves they can find over and over, and they have headsets and talk shit the whole time.  I'm all about respect, man.  </font><br />
[Sat Mar  7 00:13:30 2009] : <b>(23430) Alan</b>: <font color='#000080'>Well, about headsets, people should have respect, but I've only run into one guy ever who used a headset to dis me, and that was because I murdered him.</font><br />
[Sat Mar  7 00:13:39 2009] : <b>(23430) Alan</b>: <font color='#000080'>Most people with headsets use it to say "whoa, nice move" and stuff.</font><br />
[Sat Mar  7 00:13:49 2009] : <b>(23430) Alan</b>: <font color='#000080'>That's on PSN. Maybe XBox is different.</font><br />
[Sat Mar  7 00:13:52 2009] : <b>(23432) Aryk</b>: <font color='#710000'>Not that I encountered.  </font><br />
[Sat Mar  7 00:13:56 2009] : <b>(23430) Alan</b>: <font color='#000080'>Aww.</font><br />
[Sat Mar  7 00:14:03 2009] : <b>(23430) Alan</b>: <font color='#000080'>Maybe Soul Calibur players are dicks and SF players aren't?</font><br />
[Sat Mar  7 00:14:12 2009] : <b>(23430) Alan</b>: <font color='#000080'>I've never had a problem with Street Fighter.</font><br />
[Sat Mar  7 00:14:31 2009] : <b>(23430) Alan</b>: <font color='#000080'>As for cheap moves, nothing is cheap. Everything has a countermove.</font><br />
[Sat Mar  7 00:15:04 2009] : <b>(23430) Alan</b>: <font color='#000080'>If a move seems overpowering, it's because you don't know the counter OR because the guy has more skill. Neither one is a valid point to complain about.</font><br />
[Sat Mar  7 00:15:26 2009] : <b>(23430) Alan</b>: <font color='#000080'>If you get it, we'll play while on speakerphone or something (I don't have a headset either) and I'll explain how to counter anything I do.</font><br />
[Sat Mar  7 00:16:13 2009] : <b>(23430) Alan</b>: <font color='#000080'>In SF2, there were certain tactics that were too powerful, and had no easy countermove, but the game has evolved a great deal since then.</font><br />
[Sat Mar  7 00:16:31 2009] : <b>(23432) Aryk</b>: <font color='#710000'>Well, it's way easier to do cheap moves in Sould Calibur.</font><br />
[Sat Mar  7 00:16:40 2009] : <b>(23430) Alan</b>: <font color='#000080'>Oh, Soul Calibur, I can believe, yeah.</font><br />
[Sat Mar  7 00:16:50 2009] : <b>(23430) Alan</b>: <font color='#000080'>I suck severely at 3D fighting games, though, so I blame it on myself anyway.</font><br />
[Sat Mar  7 00:17:16 2009] : <b>(23430) Alan</b>: <font color='#000080'>I'm willing to bet 2D and 3D fighters really do attract different types of people.</font><br />

[Sat Mar  7 01:32:40 2009] : <b>(23432) Aryk</b>: <font color='#710000'>(back)</font><br />
[Sat Mar  7 01:34:51 2009] : <b>(23432) Aryk</b>: <font color='#710000'>I gotta say the situation Aryk's in now is better than I would have conceived on my own.  Kudos to you, Alan.</font><br />
[Sat Mar  7 01:34:54 2009] : <b>(23430) Alan</b>: <font color='#000080'>(Oh yeah, Rien can talk to Stonemight. What was his reward again? He's got so many offers from so many shadowy powermongers.)</font><br />
[Sat Mar  7 01:35:08 2009] : <b>(23430) Alan</b>: <font color='#000080'>Yeah, Aryk is all set up to become a demon lord if he wants. :)</font><br />
[Sat Mar  7 01:35:19 2009] : <b>(23432) Aryk</b>: <font color='#710000'>Sweet.</font><br />
[Sat Mar  7 01:35:48 2009] : <b>(23422) Rien</b>: <font color='#003300'>I think his reward was information on how to defeat Fantome... it's the price he hasn't paid yet.  They want to study him.</font><br />
[Sat Mar  7 01:36:05 2009] : <b>(23430) Alan</b>: <font color='#000080'>And this all arises from the nature of the Demon World -- before the Dragonhunt even happened, I had this idea in a previous set of short stories, that the Demon World's geography was created by its luminaries.</font><br />
[Sat Mar  7 01:36:48 2009] : <b>(23430) Alan</b>: <font color='#000080'>So if Aryk just goes to a random part of it, it'll be void, and then...</font><br />
[Sat Mar  7 01:37:10 2009] : <b>(23430) Alan</b>: <font color='#000080'>He's a pretty important dude at the moment! This world really is created for him, literally.</font><br />
[Sat Mar  7 01:37:15 2009] : <b>(23430) Alan</b>: <font color='#000080'>Holmstock was right, in a way.</font><br />
[Sat Mar  7 01:40:14 2009] : <b>(23430) Alan</b>: <font color='#000080'>Okay, I am encoffeed. Adrian, that's what I kind of thought, I just wasn't sure. Thanks.</font><br />
[Sat Mar  7 01:40:25 2009] : <b>(23430) Alan</b>: <font color='#000080'>Do you want to go talk to him, then?</font><br />
[Sat Mar  7 01:40:51 2009] : <b>(23430) Alan</b>: <font color='#000080'>You folks can decide what to play next. We're basically going to wrap up loose ends and possibly investigate new ones until the events of Chapter 15 begin.</font><br />
[Sat Mar  7 01:41:22 2009] : <b>(23430) Alan</b>: <font color='#000080'>As I said, looking for Boiling Sky (which is a plot hook, yes) would probably yield some info, but would not prematurely precipitate Chapter 15.</font><br />
[Sat Mar  7 01:41:29 2009] : <b>(23431) Renate</b>: <font color='#000080'>Well, I can tell you what Renate is doing besides practicing with Daniel, and you can decide what to do about it.</font><br />
[Sat Mar  7 01:41:42 2009] : <b>(23422) Rien</b>: <font color='#003300'>Well, it would be polite to inform him that Fantome is dead, and all of Fantome's friends can take a swing at Rien if they want... they were so eager to do so earlier.  After that, maybe Rien could stumble across this plot hook while he looks for Aryk.</font><br />
[Sat Mar  7 01:42:22 2009] : <b>(23431) Renate</b>: <font color='#000080'>"Everybody" knows about Boiling Sky, but only for dragon and hero values of "everybody." Renate wants to put the word out through Lyria's adherents, and she wants people to ask their dragons WTF they're planning to effing DO about it.</font><br />
[Sat Mar  7 01:42:46 2009] : <b>(23431) Renate</b>: <font color='#000080'>Enough with this smoke-filled rooms bullshit.</font><br />
[Sat Mar  7 01:43:02 2009] : <b>(23431) Renate</b>: <font color='#000080'>Let's have some effing TRANSPARENCY.</font><br />
[Sat Mar  7 01:43:41 2009] : <b>(23432) Aryk</b>: <font color='#710000'>(Awesome fluff btw, D)</font><br />
[Sat Mar  7 01:44:11 2009] : <b>(23431) Renate</b>: <font color='#000080'>(ty; I enjoyed deepening the Baron's story a bit)</font><br />
[Sat Mar  7 01:44:35 2009] : <b>(23431) Renate</b>: <font color='#000080'>(and ensuring that there was something more to the arranged marriage than expediency or sexism)</font><br />
[Sat Mar  7 01:45:06 2009] : <b>(23430) Alan</b>: <font color='#000080'>(Oh hey, yeah! I'm reading it now.)</font><br />
[Sat Mar  7 01:45:39 2009] : <b>(23430) Alan</b>: <font color='#000080'>(I always had it very vague, because Renate has always had so much else to do, and the subplot didn't end up seeming as important as it did in the Zion game.)</font><br />
[Sat Mar  7 01:46:13 2009] : <b>(23430) Alan</b>: <font color='#000080'>(In the Zion game, hobgoblin local politics, you know, much more brutal, and Kodaku's Arc Knight brother Naguru had to come help out, <i>literally</i> in the shape of a mushroom cloud.)</font><br />
[Sat Mar  7 01:47:13 2009] : <b>(23430) Alan</b>: <font color='#000080'>(Dragons came by and said "yeah, so uh, nobody can ever live here again, and also you're lucky you're an Arc Knight or we'd kill you on the spot for leaving radiation.")</font><br />
[Sat Mar  7 01:47:35 2009] : <b>(23431) Renate</b>: <font color='#000080'>(Hmph. They shoulda killed him anyway.)</font><br />
[Sat Mar  7 01:47:46 2009] : <b>(23430) Alan</b>: <font color='#000080'>(I agree, but they've got Dark Eternal to consider.)</font><br />
[Sat Mar  7 01:47:59 2009] : <b>(23422) Rien</b>: <font color='#003300'>(You'd think they'd have come up with some way to clean it up by now)</font><br />
[Sat Mar  7 01:48:46 2009] : <b>(23431) Renate</b>: <font color='#000080'>(F*** Dark Eternal.)</font><br />
[Sat Mar  7 01:49:40 2009] : <b>(23430) Alan</b>: <font color='#000080'>(Oh, I think they did, I didn't make a big thing out of the environmental impact. Wasn't really where I was going with it. More just that he used unreasonable force, and his secret technique was fission-based. Anyway.)</font><br />
[Sat Mar  7 01:50:57 2009] : <b>(23430) Alan</b>: <font color='#000080'>So, Stonemight or some Karlbotel? We want to see the results of Renate's work with Daniel, at least, and also possibly get a visitor.</font><br />
[Sat Mar  7 01:51:52 2009] : <b>(23430) Alan</b>: <font color='#000080'>Or actually...</font><br />
[Sat Mar  7 01:52:29 2009] : <b>(23430) Alan</b>: <font color='#000080'>...we could go to Renate trying to alarm people about Boiling Sky and see if they buy it. Kind of depends on who she goes to.</font><br />
[Sat Mar  7 01:53:03 2009] : <b>(23431) Renate</b>: <font color='#000080'>She is simply telling her story in as many venues as possible -- especially written ones that circulate -- and trying to get the Quillions to do the same.</font><br />
[Sat Mar  7 01:53:32 2009] : <b>(23422) Rien</b>: <font color='#003300'>Rien really should go see Stonemight, but that could be exposition (is that the right term?) if you want.</font><br />
[Sat Mar  7 01:54:32 2009] : <b>(23431) Renate</b>: <font color='#000080'>And personally I am tired and would like to go to bed, so why don't you deal with Stonemight?</font><br />
[Sat Mar  7 01:55:02 2009] : <b>(23430) Alan</b>: <font color='#000080'>Well, talking to Stonemight would be a matter of "gj lol, now put on these electrodes," and the results would have to be thought through more carefully.</font><br />
[Sat Mar  7 01:55:30 2009] : <b>(23430) Alan</b>: <font color='#000080'>I guess I could be down with calling it and committing to fluff (I STILL have half-written news articles!)</font><br />
[Sat Mar  7 01:55:50 2009] : <b>(23430) Alan</b>: <font color='#000080'>My friend is actually still hanging out over here, he's playing SF4 while I RPGize.</font><br />
[Sat Mar  7 01:56:03 2009] : <b>(23422) Rien</b>: <font color='#003300'>We could conclude early tonight if you want.</font><br />
[Sat Mar  7 01:56:03 2009] : <b>(23430) Alan</b>: <font color='#000080'>So I didn't get my usual pre-dragonhunt nap!</font><br />

[Sat Mar  7 01:56:23 2009] : <b>(23431) Renate</b>: <font color='#000080'>oh, one other thing</font><br />
[Sat Mar  7 01:56:27 2009] : <b>(23430) Alan</b>: <font color='#000080'>Well, let's do any more planning/discussion we need to do, first. Is there anything I should be doing or taking into account?</font><br />

[Sat Mar  7 01:57:02 2009] : <b>(23430) Alan</b>: <font color='#000080'>We can do it over email, but don't let me sleep on it.</font><br />
[Sat Mar  7 01:57:39 2009] : <b>(23430) Alan</b>: <font color='#000080'>Well, I don't want to unilaterally come up with stuff, and Matt and Adrian can attest that (within game balance limits) I've been cheerfully accepting anything they come up with.</font><br />
[Sat Mar  7 01:58:07 2009] : <b>(23432) Aryk</b>: <font color='#710000'>I just made cooler versions of things I already had.</font><br />
[Sat Mar  7 01:58:10 2009] : <b>(23430) Alan</b>: <font color='#000080'>On the other hand, Adrian can attest that I'm also fine with coming up with things if it's not your area.</font><br />
[Sat Mar  7 01:58:31 2009] : <b>(23431) Renate</b>: <font color='#000080'>I'll think about it.</font><br />
