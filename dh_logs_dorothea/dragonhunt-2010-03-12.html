[Fri Mar 12 20:54:25 2010] : <b>(4877) Alan</b>: <font color='#000080'>Ah. See, there's the confusion. Ricci was talking about Boiling Sky taking the portal up; and at the same time, Dark Eternal was making his move, flying in while cloaked.</font><br />
[Fri Mar 12 20:54:55 2010] : <b>(4877) Alan</b>: <font color='#000080'>(No idea what's up with the connection. My other computers are stable, so it's just the laptop antenna.)</font><br />

[Fri Mar 12 20:55:33 2010] : <b>(4870) Rien</b>: <font color='#400040'>Yep</font><br />
[Fri Mar 12 20:55:53 2010] : <b>(4877) Alan</b>: <font color='#000080'>Then the glass reverses direction as the air is sucked out of the bridge; at the same time, Dark Eternal raises a hand, and everyone on the bridge is encased in a little white air-filled ball, and they all clatter together like a game of pachinko as they drain out into space.</font><br />
[Fri Mar 12 20:56:08 2010] : <b>(4877) Alan</b>: <font color='#000080'>They were picked up terrified but unharmed later, Ricci says.</font><br />
[Fri Mar 12 20:57:14 2010] : <b>(4877) Alan</b>: <font color='#000080'>Dark Eternal is then seen in a montage of moving images as he walks through the corridors, hitting everyone who attacks him with a paralyzing green shot of lightning.</font><br />
[Fri Mar 12 20:57:52 2010] : <b>(4877) Alan</b>: <font color='#000080'>When he gets to the dark corridor that leads to the power core room, you see yourselves, inside, and then you see the battle replayed from many angles.</font><br />
[Fri Mar 12 20:58:52 2010] : <b>(4877) Alan</b>: <font color='#000080'>It's revealed that sure enough, the handle Dark Eternal wanted Renate to pull would have ejected the power core and Boiling Sky along with it, but would also have placed the entire reactor room under stasis, immobilizing everyone.

[Fri Mar 12 20:59:27 2010] : <b>(4870) Rien</b>: <font color='#400040'>And would have left him free to kill the Sage, not that he wasn't anyway.</font><br />

[Fri Mar 12 21:01:08 2010] : <b>(4877) Alan</b>: <font color='#000080'>Yes, there's an "evil dragon in the power room" protocol.</font><br />
[Fri Mar 12 21:01:30 2010] : <b>(4870) Rien</b>: <font color='#400040'>I'd be surprised if there isn't.</font><br />
[Fri Mar 12 21:01:46 2010] : <b>(4877) Alan</b>: <font color='#000080'>Next, Ricci shows the data gathered by Rubylith's planar specialists after the fact. They have sophisticated device that monitor the planar field, of course -- astral travel is a legitimate attack vector.</font><br />

[Fri Mar 12 21:10:01 2010] : <b>(4877) Alan</b>: <font color='#000080'>"But I am, more than most dragons, a ruler of humans, and should think like a human."</font><br />
[Fri Mar 12 21:11:01 2010] : <b>(4877) Alan</b>: <font color='#000080'>"Then let me decide first: yes, ethics. As long as this is a matter of retribution rather than survival, I will do things the 'right' way."</font><br />
[Fri Mar 12 21:11:41 2010] : <b>(4867) Renate</b>: <font color='#000080'>"Retribution?" she queries, very softly indeed.</font><br />
[Fri Mar 12 21:15:04 2010] : <b>(4877) Alan</b>: <font color='#000080'>"For the harm Dark Eternal has caused to my people," Rubylith says. "If my ethics remain skewed or obtuse, help me understand the right perspective."</font><br />
[Fri Mar 12 21:16:01 2010] : <b>(4867) Renate</b>: <font color='#000080'>"Perhaps it is merely a matter of language," she suggests. "'Retribution' in our tongue implies a personal vendetta rather than an ethical imperative, Your Imperial Majesty."</font><br />
[Fri Mar 12 21:17:43 2010] : <b>(4877) Alan</b>: <font color='#000080'>"I meant to use the word which comes from the temple tongue, <i>retribuere</i>, to 'hand back' the evil done to us."</font><br />
[Fri Mar 12 21:18:17 2010] : <b>(4877) Alan</b>: <font color='#000080'>"I meant it in the sense of seeing justice done."</font><br />
[Fri Mar 12 21:18:51 2010] : <b>(4877) Alan</b>: <font color='#000080'>"Is not justice vengeance by accepted means?"</font><br />
[Fri Mar 12 21:18:56 2010] : <b>(4867) Renate</b>: <font color='#000080'>"Shall we then allow evil to reverberate through all the worlds until the end of time?" Renate asks, not without pain.</font><br />
[Fri Mar 12 21:19:42 2010] : <b>(4877) Alan</b>: <font color='#000080'>"I am familiar with your accomplishments. Would you say that Dark Eternal is closer to Purgatory... or to Edouard Borgrave?"</font><br />
[Fri Mar 12 21:19:47 2010] : <b>(4867) Renate</b>: <font color='#000080'>"No, Sire; or, at least, not solely that. Justice, I was taught, is a restoration of balance, a defense against continued evil."</font><br />
[Fri Mar 12 21:20:01 2010] : <b>(4867) Renate</b>: <font color='#000080'>"Saints and angels." She shudders outright.</font><br />
[Fri Mar 12 21:20:45 2010] : <b>(4877) Alan</b>: <font color='#000080'>"Dark Eternal is a clear and immediate threat to <i>everyone</i>. You would have a difficult time naming a being on any planet or above it who has no reason to fear him."</font><br />
[Fri Mar 12 21:21:37 2010] : <b>(4867) Renate</b>: <font color='#000080'>Renate sighs. "Then for that reason you should oppose him; but do not use Mistress Aries's death as a mere pretext. She was worth more than that."</font><br />
[Fri Mar 12 21:22:56 2010] : <b>(4877) Alan</b>: <font color='#000080'>"That said, if I am to pursue a grievance in Council, this incident must be the charge."</font><br />
[Fri Mar 12 21:24:05 2010] : <b>(4867) Renate</b>: <font color='#000080'>"Yes, I daresay. Not knowing the customs of the Council, Sire, I must ask: would killing a mortal citizen ordinarily be a matter of such gravity?"</font><br />
[Fri Mar 12 21:25:05 2010] : <b>(4877) Alan</b>: <font color='#000080'>"By the exact wording of the Accords, yes. In practice, it would be handled through diplomacy. But direct diplomacy is impossible, since my nation is removed from the earth by exile."</font><br />
[Fri Mar 12 21:25:08 2010] : <b>(4870) Rien</b>: <font color='#400040'>"I think it would be less the killing of Mistress Aries, and more the invasion of sovreign territory to do so.  Also, the violation of the accord against travelling off the surface into this realm."</font><br />
[Fri Mar 12 21:25:54 2010] : <b>(4877) Alan</b>: <font color='#000080'>"Dark Eternal has clearly executed an extremely premeditated incursion for the primary or secondary purpose of killing one of my citizens. This is sufficient grounds to at least get the Council's attention."</font><br />
[Fri Mar 12 21:26:26 2010] : <b>(4867) Renate</b>: <font color='#000080'>She nods. "I see no ethical reason you should not pursue this in Council, Sire."</font><br />

[Fri Mar 12 21:27:01 2010] : <b>(4867) Renate</b>: <font color='#000080'>"Oh, Sire." She, too, laughs.</font><br />
[Fri Mar 12 21:27:11 2010] : <b>(4877) Alan</b>: <font color='#000080'>"A final question. Ricci, if you would?" The military investigator bows and slips out.</font><br />

[Fri Mar 12 21:30:39 2010] : <b>(4870) Rien</b>: <font color='#400040'>Rien shakes his head, "Sire, I cannot do such a thing.  These are my problems, and I have learned that they are at least partially of my own doing.  I cannot run away from them.  I must face them.  No matter the consequences for myself."</font><br />
[Fri Mar 12 21:30:42 2010] : <b>(4877) Alan</b>: <font color='#000080'>"But if you went there, you would be free of Dark Eternal's manipulation once and for all."</font><br />

[Fri Mar 12 21:52:39 2010] : <b>(4870) Rien</b>: <font color='#400040'>Since the Sages said that if they'd gotten to it before Old-Rien had, they would have done the same to *all* mortal humans.</font><br />
[Fri Mar 12 21:53:59 2010] : <b>(4867) Renate</b>: <font color='#000080'>Hm. Indeed. Well, presumably someday the poor kids will get over their grief and want a tiebreaker.</font><br />
[Fri Mar 12 21:54:17 2010] : <b>(4867) Renate</b>: <font color='#000080'>It's actually a fairly awful thing to do to Renate... but no denying she'd be good at it.</font><br />
[Fri Mar 12 21:54:43 2010] : <b>(4870) Rien</b>: <font color='#400040'>It gave me a horrible image, too.</font><br />
[Fri Mar 12 21:55:23 2010] : <b>(4870) Rien</b>: <font color='#400040'>Combine Old Rien with new Rien, and you might have someone who loves Renate but is now willing to do *anything* to get her back.  And who knows what the Intellect Trigger was, how it worked and how to build another one.</font><br />
[Fri Mar 12 21:56:10 2010] : <b>(4867) Renate</b>: <font color='#000080'>... yikes.</font><br />
[Fri Mar 12 21:56:38 2010] : <b>(4867) Renate</b>: <font color='#000080'>She will kick his happy ass out to the Empire of the Stars HERSELF if that happens.</font><br />
