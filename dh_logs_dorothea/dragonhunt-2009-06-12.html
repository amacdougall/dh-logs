[Fri Jun 12 23:28:53 2009] : <b>(28048) Alan</b>: <font color='#000080'>"In some of exceptional virtue, that motive can be overcome by even nobler ones: love of country, or love of the divine, or love of virtue itself.

[Fri Jun 12 23:29:18 2009] : <b>(28048) Alan</b>: <font color='#000080'>"For among our race, a different urge occupies that place. The urge to <i>rule</i>."</font><br />
[Fri Jun 12 23:30:16 2009] : <b>(28048) Alan</b>: <font color='#000080'>"Just below the need to save our own life is the need to control those around us, to have subordinates, servants, or slaves -- by your system of virtues this is reprehensible, and we are well aware of this, even somewhat abashed."</font><br />
[Fri Jun 12 23:30:53 2009] : <b>(28048) Alan</b>: <font color='#000080'>"But it is immutable. Where a dragon lives, a dragon must rule. And it was this need which led us nearly to extinction."</font><br />

[Fri Jun 12 23:34:12 2009] : <b>(28048) Alan</b>: <font color='#000080'>"We learned the lessons of our home universe well: we formed Articles of Transit and Articles of War, governing our behavior in the world to come.

We expect no thanks."</font><br />
[Fri Jun 12 23:34:43 2009] : <b>(28048) Alan</b>: <font color='#000080'>"I explain this only that you may know us, and know our minds: so that you may consider well the offer I bring."</font><br />
