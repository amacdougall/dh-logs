I am now working on improving <a href="http://openrpg.wrathof.com">openrpg.wrathof.com</a>.  I plan on expanding the character sheet section, and also having a forum for the OpenRPG DEV II server where groups can have their own message boards, one private and one public per room. If anyone is interested please drop by the site and leave comments.  Note that the site is still being heavily developed so at any moment there could be some issues as I am working on the code.

[Fri Nov 30 18:38:08 2007] : <b>(4588) Sashi</b>: <font color='#003300'>I've got a place in mind.  Studio apartment in Toorak (which is just outside Melbourne).  10 minutes from there to work.  Place is partially furnished, with desk, couch, TV cabinet, kitchen appliances, and so on.  Recently renovated, really nice carpeting, security entrance, attached bathroom (with bath!) and communal laundry facilities.</font><br />

[Fri Nov 30 18:44:51 2007] : <b>(4588) Sashi</b>: <font color='#003300'>Oh, my boss wandered over to me and started a conversation with the words, "Adrian, I just wanted to say to you..." and my paranoia kicked in.  What he wanted to tell me was that they'd moved a bunch of our customers off an old system at work onto a new system that's been my pet project for the last couple of months, and everything went very smoothly, without a hitch, and he thought that this was mainly due to my heard work and dedication.</font><br />

[Fri Nov 30 19:00:57 2007] : <b>(4592) Alan</b>: <font color='#000080'>It's a fair walk through the crack between the bricks; but halfway through, light comes from inside and it's easy to make your way. The total distance feels like half a city block.</font><br />

[Fri Nov 30 19:02:20 2007] : <b>(4592) Alan</b>: <font color='#000080'>Ahead of you is a narrow street, more than an alley but not by much, lined densely with three-story houses built up to the ceiling, or two-story houses with rooftop gardens.</font><br />
[Fri Nov 30 19:03:24 2007] : <b>(4588) Sashi</b>: <font color='#003300'>(I wouldn't mind having a rooftop garden, except that they're illegal around here.)</font><br />
[Fri Nov 30 19:03:53 2007] : <b>(4592) Alan</b>: <font color='#000080'>Some of the structures use large-world items -- you see matchsticks or needles used as frames, chairs made from bits of broken buttons, and the like -- but for the most part, the building techniques are designed to scale, along the lines of dollhouse furniture.</font><br />
[Fri Nov 30 19:05:11 2007] : <b>(4592) Alan</b>: <font color='#000080'>"This is the Underside, humans," says the beetle sitting on a button-stool at your end of the street (which ends in the wall you came out of).</font><br />

[Fri Nov 30 19:07:03 2007] : <b>(4592) Alan</b>: <font color='#000080'>The beetle sighs (or rather, expels a whistling sigh through its spicules). "You are humans, so I can't really take offense. Look, I'm the guard. Really just a formality. So state your business and you can be off."</font><br />

[Fri Nov 30 19:08:47 2007] : <b>(4592) Alan</b>: <font color='#000080'>"Was that some sort of hex? Did she just hex me?" The beetle doesn't seem overly concerned.</font><br />
[Fri Nov 30 19:08:51 2007] : <b>(4589) Tancred</b>: <font color='#000080'>(Right, what's her name again?)</font><br />

[Fri Nov 30 19:12:57 2007] : <b>(4592) Alan</b>: <font color='#000080'>The cul-de-sac is quiet; there are few pedestrians anywhere in here. In fact, it's hard to tell if any of the buildings are populated; their windows are all thickly translucent, yielding a warm yellow-orange glow but no real signs of movement.</font><br />
[Fri Nov 30 19:13:50 2007] : <b>(4592) Alan</b>: <font color='#000080'>It leads to a four-way intersection, with a little lamp at its center; one way looks as good as another.</font><br />
[Fri Nov 30 19:14:14 2007] : <b>(4592) Alan</b>: <font color='#000080'>The silence doesn't give a menacing impression; instead, everything just feels sleepy, comfortable, but maybe a bit lonesome.</font><br />
[Fri Nov 30 19:14:41 2007] : <b>(4592) Alan</b>: <font color='#000080'>Somewhere from far down to the left, you can hear a high-pitched voice warbling something about ice cream.</font><br />
[Fri Nov 30 19:14:58 2007] : <b>(4589) Tancred</b>: <font color='#000080'>"Sounds nice, but no. Anybody see anything vaguely palatial?"</font><br />
[Fri Nov 30 19:15:07 2007] : <b>(4592) Alan</b>: <font color='#000080'>Either it's a salesbeing, or someone just really likes ice cream.</font><br />
[Fri Nov 30 19:16:40 2007] : <b>(4592) Alan</b>: <font color='#000080'>Arno is looking in each direction with a spyglass, to no avail. "I can't tell what we're even in. The roof and walls are earthen, I think. Sound is a bit muffled, I'd guess it's more like matted grass. With the houses built along the corridor walls, there's no way of getting the big picture."</font><br />
[Fri Nov 30 19:17:20 2007] : <b>(4592) Alan</b>: <font color='#000080'>"We don't need the big picture," Cobitan says, holding out his deck. He fans it and extends it to Sashi. "Pick a card. Any card."</font><br />
[Fri Nov 30 19:17:29 2007] : <b>(4592) Alan</b>: <font color='#000080'>"Don't tell me what it is!"</font><br />

[Fri Nov 30 19:18:40 2007] : <b>(4592) Alan</b>: <font color='#000080'>"At length, Essentialist Bishop returned to the hunting lodge emptyhanded. There he found the diviner and the houndmaster polishing off a bowl of rabbit stew."</font><br />
[Fri Nov 30 19:18:59 2007] : <b>(4588) Sashi</b>: <font color='#003300'>Sashi sighs and takes a card from the desk, inspecting it, wondering if she could slit someone's throat with it.</font><br />
[Fri Nov 30 19:20:06 2007] : <b>(4592) Alan</b>: <font color='#000080'>The card is labeled in a script Sashi doesn't understand (I assume written Valinese wasn't in the crash course, though Tancred could figure it out via Yewey), but it bears an illustration of a pack of hunting dogs in full run.</font><br />
[Fri Nov 30 19:20:20 2007] : <b>(4592) Alan</b>: <font color='#000080'>"'You chased the rabbit,' the diviner said. 'But I waited for it.'"</font><br />

[Fri Nov 30 19:21:04 2007] : <b>(4592) Alan</b>: <font color='#000080'>"It's always embarassing reciting the wrong parable."</font><br />
[Fri Nov 30 19:22:19 2007] : <b>(4592) Alan</b>: <font color='#000080'>"Now look deep into it."</font><br />
[Fri Nov 30 19:22:42 2007] : <b>(4592) Alan</b>: <font color='#000080'>"Come on, everyone." Cobitan urges everyone to gather around and focus on the card.</font><br />
[Fri Nov 30 19:22:52 2007] : <b>(4592) Alan</b>: <font color='#000080'>"Try to get tunnel vision, don't see anything but the card."</font><br />
[Fri Nov 30 19:22:55 2007] : <b>(4589) Tancred</b>: <font color='#000080'>Tancred sighs and obliges.</font><br />
[Fri Nov 30 19:22:56 2007] : <b>(4588) Sashi</b>: <font color='#003300'>Sashi arches an eyebrow, staring into the card held in her right hand.  Her left hovers just above the hilt of the dagger strapped to her left thigh.</font><br />
[Fri Nov 30 19:23:51 2007] : <b>(4592) Alan</b>: <font color='#000080'>It takes a combination of mental blankness and optic effort to squeeze out peripheral vision and fall into the card, particularly for Sashi's wary nature; but once you get the trick of it, you realize that the card is actually showing the very street you were standing on.</font><br />
[Fri Nov 30 19:24:05 2007] : <b>(4592) Alan</b>: <font color='#000080'>"Now, look up!" Cobitan says, clapping.</font><br />
[Fri Nov 30 19:25:20 2007] : <b>(4592) Alan</b>: <font color='#000080'>And you're at the entrance of something that is, if not palatial, at least important-looking: a temple-like portico with pillars carved from a white that might be marble or bone.</font><br />
[Fri Nov 30 19:25:48 2007] : <b>(4589) Tancred</b>: <font color='#000080'>"Very nice. Appropriate to the name. Shall we?"</font><br />
[Fri Nov 30 19:26:01 2007] : <b>(4592) Alan</b>: <font color='#000080'>"I must assume this is it," Cobitan says. "Now we just have to wait to get there." He points back at the card -- it shows three men and a girl walking briskly along the quiet streets of the Meager Ways.</font><br />
[Fri Nov 30 19:26:53 2007] : <b>(4592) Alan</b>: <font color='#000080'>"Until we do, our minds are present here just as phantoms. As long as nobody decides to interfere with our bodies, they'll arrive in due time."</font><br />
[Fri Nov 30 19:27:39 2007] : <b>(4592) Alan</b>: <font color='#000080'>Arno Davik gives Cobitan a slight shove. "You feel solid to me." He goes over and taps one of the pillars. "Solid here too."</font><br />
[Fri Nov 30 19:27:55 2007] : <b>(4592) Alan</b>: <font color='#000080'>"I'm just going to go in. Not that I don't believe you, but why not get intel?"</font><br />

[Fri Nov 30 19:28:38 2007] : <b>(4589) Tancred</b>: <font color='#000080'>"How long is this going to take?" Tancred demands impatiently.</font><br />
[Fri Nov 30 19:28:39 2007] : <b>(4592) Alan</b>: <font color='#000080'>"You have a very strange type of magic, Burnblack."</font><br />
[Fri Nov 30 19:29:06 2007] : <b>(4592) Alan</b>: <font color='#000080'>"Looks to me like you're the one holding us up," Cobitan says, peering at the card. "Maybe if you weren't so dinged up from your mishaps."</font><br />
[Fri Nov 30 19:30:40 2007] : <b>(4592) Alan</b>: <font color='#000080'>"Ah. We were closer than we thought, though a wrong turn could have put us anywhere." He points down the building-lined corridor: copies of you (or the real yous, if Cobitan is to be believed) are walking up it toward you.</font><br />
[Fri Nov 30 19:30:49 2007] : <b>(4588) Sashi</b>: <font color='#003300'>Sashi's fingers tighten on the hilt of her dagger as she fully realises what's going on.</font><br />
[Fri Nov 30 19:30:52 2007] : <b>(4592) Alan</b>: <font color='#000080'>He waves, and his doppelganger mirrors the gesture exactly.</font><br />

[Fri Nov 30 19:31:16 2007] : <b>(4592) Alan</b>: <font color='#000080'>"We're here in mind only," Cobitan says to her. "Weren't you paying attention?"</font><br />
[Fri Nov 30 19:32:08 2007] : <b>(4592) Alan</b>: <font color='#000080'>In fact, once the other-yous get within a stone's throw, you start to realize that you're actually them, walking quickly toward the white portico; it's a feeling like waking up from a vivid dream.</font><br />
[Fri Nov 30 19:32:20 2007] : <b>(4588) Sashi</b>: <font color='#003300'>Sashi moves in a blur.  Suddenly she's behind Cobitan, her hand pulling his head back by the chin, and the serrated edge of her dagger against his throat.</font><br />
[Fri Nov 30 19:32:55 2007] : <b>(4592) Alan</b>: <font color='#000080'>(Even as Sashi does this, she fades into her actual body. She could repeat the action in real life if she wants, though!)</font><br />

[Fri Nov 30 19:34:09 2007] : <b>(4592) Alan</b>: <font color='#000080'>Cobitan just clams up and stands as still as possible, which is really the only reasonable thing to do in that situation.</font><br />

[Fri Nov 30 19:34:54 2007] : <b>(4592) Alan</b>: <font color='#000080'>Arno folds his arms and shakes his head. "Crazy tot. The man's magic found us the palace. It's weird and I don't want it to happen again, but I can say the exact same thing about everything since I met you freaks."</font><br />

[Fri Nov 30 19:40:02 2007] : <b>(4592) Alan</b>: <font color='#000080'>There are no guards or servitors at the entrance; instead, the doorways past the portico lead right into a long entrance hall with antechambers to either side, and large brass dark wood doors at the far end.</font><br />
[Fri Nov 30 19:40:44 2007] : <b>(4592) Alan</b>: <font color='#000080'>Scale glowbulbs are lit, and tiny chips of large-world incense cones burn in brass saucers.</font><br />

We happened to be talking about driving on a curved road; since I had an equation right there for calculating (I think) velocity when traveling on a curve, I cluelessly read it out, thinking it was interesting. The rest of the class stared at me. One kid said, "Hey, you know what I did today in my science class?" I said no. He said, "A crossword puzzle.""</font><br />

[Fri Nov 30 21:39:13 2007] : <b>(4588) Sashi</b>: <font color='#003300'>One company decided to use XML for all the configuration files in a certain high-availability program.  It's a nightmare to configure this damn thing, especially since it won't tell you if there's a problem in your XML, let alone where that problem is.

The other thing here is that what you put into this file is taken by the program, parsed down into the old-style files, parsed again to get the data out of it, then re-written back into XML, because this program also uses this XML file for storing live-running data for the cluster.
