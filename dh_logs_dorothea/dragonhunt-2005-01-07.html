[Fri Jan 07 19:30:30 2005] : <B>Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>I'll think it over. There's already continued subplotting planned.</font><br>

[Fri Jan 07 19:35:25 2005] : <B>Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>The idea behind the tariff is to encourage people to leave, of course... and I got it backwards; the tariff is on goods ENTERING Glenworth, not leaving. Bah.</font><br>

[Fri Jan 07 21:47:19 2005] : <B>Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>Hm, I was going to suggest that Arretia stick around Eleanora for safety, but I guess if she wants to hang with us, that's okay.</font><br>

[Fri Jan 07 21:48:15 2005] : <B>Aryk</B>: <font color='#000080'>I don't think that we're in any physical danger at the rap-tournament.  Arretia will be fine.</font><br>
[Fri Jan 07 21:48:52 2005] : <B>Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>I dunno. Crowded room, lots of noise and hustle, plenty of opportunity to poison somebody.</font><br>

[Fri Jan 07 21:49:33 2005] : <B>Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>Probably not, but if we all leave, she's the obvious choice!</font><br>
[Fri Jan 07 21:50:25 2005] : <B>Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>Anyway, Renate talking to Eleanora was my idea for getting you that gig even if we fuck up the bust. :)</font><br>

[Fri Jan 07 21:50:59 2005] : <B>Aryk</B>: <font color='#000080'>That was quite cool on your part, D.</font><br>

[Fri Jan 07 21:52:13 2005] : <B>Aryk</B>: <font color='#000080'>Too bad you couldn't make it for the first rap-off, Adrien.  Then at least you could have been playing Master Tanager tonight.</font><br>

[Fri Jan 07 21:52:46 2005] : <B>Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>But it is always good to have a backup plan. And a backup plan backing up the backup plan.</font><br>
[Fri Jan 07 21:53:26 2005] : <B>Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>So, I guess we go to that condemned apartment building (I forget its name) and try our luck?</font><br>
