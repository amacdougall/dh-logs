[Fri May 22 23:45:51 2009] : <b>(27183) Alan</b>: <font color='#000080'>"Of course, he's still waiting at the gate right now, so we will have time to prepare... though I don't know that we need to."</font><br />
[Fri May 22 23:46:11 2009] : <b>(27183) Alan</b>: <font color='#000080'>"What say you?"</font><br />
[Fri May 22 23:46:45 2009] : <b>(27178) Tristan Laurent</b>: <font color='#003300'>"I'd be interested to hear what they have to say.  Even if we were to assume it would all be lies, the lies one tells show the outline of the truth they're avoiding."</font><br />
[Fri May 22 23:47:37 2009] : <b>(27179) Noemi</b>: <font color='#710000'>"Honestly, your majesty?  If there is any chance at all of negotiation... I say we welcome it," Noemi says candidly.  </font><br />
[Fri May 22 23:47:54 2009] : <b>(27183) Alan</b>: <font color='#000080'>"Hear him," Bernard agrees. "This war has proceeded on terms of pure hostility. If they come only to offer threats, let them. If they offer some other proposal, I would fain hear it as well."</font><br />
[Fri May 22 23:48:35 2009] : <b>(27183) Alan</b>: <font color='#000080'>"This is not to say that I can imagine ceding them the current boundaries," he says, face twisting, "but..."</font><br />
[Fri May 22 23:49:07 2009] : <b>(27179) Noemi</b>: <font color='#710000'>A miniscule glimmer of wonderment, possibly even hope, forms in Noemi's soul.  She takes her position near Rousseau once again.</font><br />
[Fri May 22 23:49:32 2009] : <b>(27183) Alan</b>: <font color='#000080'>He doesn't need to finish the thought. The war has been hard-fought and much has been lost, but so far, the elven nation has not lost its spirit or integrity, even if its borders have shrunk.</font><br />
[Fri May 22 23:50:17 2009] : <b>(27183) Alan</b>: <font color='#000080'>"Celeste?" the Emperor asks.</font><br />
[Fri May 22 23:51:03 2009] : <b>(27183) Alan</b>: <font color='#000080'>That particular advisor rises from her position below and behind the throne -- a seat normally used by body servants who might need to give the king a massage or a cup of wine.</font><br />
[Fri May 22 23:51:26 2009] : <b>(27183) Alan</b>: <font color='#000080'>She speaks very softly, preserving the illusion that she has no formal place in court.</font><br />
[Fri May 22 23:54:11 2009] : <b>(27183) Alan</b>: <font color='#000080'>"'Normal commerce' has been a razor's edge lately. If we can get even a temporary agreement, that breather will let us get back on top. Otherwise we'll have to slam over to military production, which would make the merchant class scream."</font><br />
[Fri May 22 23:54:58 2009] : <b>(27183) Alan</b>: <font color='#000080'>With no place in court, she also gets to skip all the your-majestying and elaborate diction. The emperor seems to prefer it, at least from her.</font><br />
[Fri May 22 23:55:19 2009] : <b>(27183) Alan</b>: <font color='#000080'>"All considered. Let us see our visitor."</font><br />
[Fri May 22 23:55:24 2009] : <b>(27183) Alan</b>: <font color='#000080'>(Says the emperor.)</font><br />
[Fri May 22 23:56:41 2009] : <b>(27183) Alan</b>: <font color='#000080'>He nods to the day steward, who announces, "At the south gate of Desmarais Palace, a messenger from the Horde. He will be admitted to the imperial presence one half hour from now. The nobility of the fourth degree and above, and essential military advisors, will attend."</font><br />
[Fri May 22 23:57:14 2009] : <b>(27183) Alan</b>: <font color='#000080'>Those nobility who are excluded immediately begin filing out, not without a few muted grumbles which are hardly noticed above the sudden intense buzz of shock and speculation.</font><br />
[Fri May 22 23:57:36 2009] : <b>(27183) Alan</b>: <font color='#000080'>Rousseau begins to leave as well, ushering St. Lucien along behind him.</font><br />
[Fri May 22 23:57:48 2009] : <b>(27183) Alan</b>: <font color='#000080'>Bernard almost says something, but instead raises an eyebrow at Noemi.</font><br />
[Fri May 22 23:58:48 2009] : <b>(27179) Noemi</b>: <font color='#710000'>"Rousseau," she says, after a moment's deliberation.  "Off so soon?"</font><br />
[Fri May 22 23:59:04 2009] : <b>(27183) Alan</b>: <font color='#000080'>This is Laurent's chance to buttonhole St. Lucien, too, although as players you might prefer to find out what the Horde messenger has to say now instead of next session! :)</font><br />
[Fri May 22 23:59:14 2009] : <b>(27179) Noemi</b>: <font color='#710000'>"I thought you might wish to hear this emissary of the Horde out?"</font><br />
[Fri May 22 23:59:38 2009] : <b>(27183) Alan</b>: <font color='#000080'>"As you request, commander," he replies with a salute.</font><br />
[Fri May 22 23:59:59 2009] : <b>(27178) Tristan Laurent</b>: <font color='#003300'>No, let's save the buttonholing for next session.  We'll take it as read and skip back?</font><br />
