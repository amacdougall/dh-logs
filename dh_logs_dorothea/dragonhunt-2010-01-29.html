[Fri Jan 29 20:32:27 2010] : <b>(2852) Alan</b>: <font color='#000080'>While Boiling Sky was distracted, Dark Eternal was resuming dragon form; he's crouched next to a spinning warning light, and he appears only as a reddish silhouette every second.</font><br />
[Fri Jan 29 20:34:04 2010] : <b>(2852) Alan</b>: <font color='#000080'>From the darkness comes a near-solid beam of purple light... which goes right past Boiling Sky to hit the wall behind him.

[Fri Jan 29 20:37:08 2010] : <b>(2852) Alan</b>: <font color='#000080'>The soldiers are knocked down as if by a mighty wind; to Aryk's eyes, and what Renate can perceive, everyone is being sucked toward the hole.

[Fri Jan 29 20:37:39 2010] : <b>(2852) Alan</b>: <font color='#000080'>They're flying along like rag dolls, still unable to react to anything. Some of them hit the torn metal of the hole, and are impaled, or their suits rip -- death either way.</font><br />

[Fri Jan 29 20:43:09 2010] : <b>(2852) Alan</b>: <font color='#000080'>Rien is able to solidify enough of the remaining air to block off the hole; Boiling Sky doesn't stop what he's doing. He's trying to focus the matrix enough to teleport away.</font><br />
[Fri Jan 29 20:43:12 2010] : <b>(2854) Aryk</b>: <font color='#710000'>"TRYING, JERK!" Aryk yells back.</font><br />
[Fri Jan 29 20:43:28 2010] : <b>(2852) Alan</b>: <font color='#000080'>The Sage shimmers and returns to the upper mezzanine.</font><br />

[Fri Jan 29 20:48:18 2010] : <b>(2852) Alan</b>: <font color='#000080'>Rien's air blast knocks Boiling Sky back further into the hole; now he's outside the power core room, but still clutching the hull.

[Fri Jan 29 20:48:46 2010] : <b>(2852) Alan</b>: <font color='#000080'>Holmstock says in Aryk's mind, "That's all I can do... I'll be sucked out into the sky if I stay." And he dematerializes.</font><br />

[Fri Jan 29 20:50:22 2010] : <b>(2854) Aryk</b>: <font color='#710000'>Aryk uses his revised burning shield to spring off the wall adjacent to Boiling Sky, and then propels himself forward, flying kick style, with the same maneuver and the black wings, to kick the end of the spear with all the momentum he can muster.</font><br />

[Fri Jan 29 20:52:15 2010] : <b>(2852) Alan</b>: <font color='#000080'>Aryk's kick sends the spear home into Boiling Sky's heart; and though this may not even be enough to kill him, it makes him lose his grip, and the dragon flies out into space.</font><br />
