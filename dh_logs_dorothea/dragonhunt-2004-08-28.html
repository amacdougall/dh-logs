[Sat Aug 28 13:13:15 2004] : <B>Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>She is wearing a tunic distinctly too big, over baggy trousers tied tightly at the waist -- they raided the pirates' stores for spare clothing, and this was the best she could find. At least it is wholly unmartial, her battered leathers and Crescent Light nowhere to be seen.</font><br>
[Sat Aug 28 13:14:05 2004] : <B>Aryk</B>: <font color='#000080'>Aryk wears the usual garb.  In fact, it looks like he slept in them.  Then again, it doesn't look like he's had much sleep.</font><br>

[Sat Aug 28 13:19:26 2004] : <B>Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>"All right, then." She undoes the top button of her tunic, and folds down its mandarin collar neatly. She brushes her hand across the nape of her neck, a wasted gesture as there is no hair there to sweep aside. "You may kill me now, as you need."</font><br>
[Sat Aug 28 13:20:15 2004] : <B>Aryk</B>: <font color='#000080'>Aryk shakes his head and laughs, albeit a bit unnervingly.  "Don't be stupid."</font><br>
[Sat Aug 28 13:21:14 2004] : <B>Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>"I'm not. The one grace I have is taking responsibility for what I've done. So here I am. I have trafficked with the worshippers of demons. Does that not give you cause to require my life of me? Well, take it, then."</font><br>
[Sat Aug 28 13:21:46 2004] : <B>Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>"I trust Rien to get Crescent Light back to my family. There's nothing else to wait for or worry about."</font><br>

[Sat Aug 28 13:25:04 2004] : <B>Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>"Suppose you explain it," she says again.</font><br>
[Sat Aug 28 13:26:21 2004] : <B>Aryk</B>: <font color='#000080'>"Because all my life I've been taught the difference between good and evil.  All I know, all that's real to me, I learned from the church.  What I didn't expect... when I stepped out unto the world..."</font><br>
[Sat Aug 28 13:27:19 2004] : <B>Aryk</B>: <font color='#000080'>"...Was the... the... gray area.  My friends who make deals with pirates who worship the Lord of the Living Dawn.... servants of Raphael who heal murderers for money..."</font><br>

I have dreams, sometimes... dreams of red-hot iron and ice-cold steel, of manacles and chains and racks, of looking up toward heaven with no hope ever of seeing it... I do know, Aryk. I do."</font><br>
[Sat Aug 28 13:32:46 2004] : <B>Aryk</B>: <font color='#000080'>"...You do?  Then... then why, Renate?!  Rien... Rien kept telling me that sometimes for the greater good you have to make sacrfices... you must agree with him.... But Renate.... there is no sacrfice worth succumbing to evil."</font><br>
[Sat Aug 28 13:34:55 2004] : <B>Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>"If I do not do what I do, Aryk, someone else must. I would rather stain my own soul than another's. So I do, and I confess what I do, and I repeat to myself the words contrition, penance, forgiveness, mercy."</font><br>
[Sat Aug 28 13:35:23 2004] : <B>Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>"I don't know what else I can do."</font><br>
[Sat Aug 28 13:37:34 2004] : <B>Aryk</B>: <font color='#000080'>Aryk shakes his head.  "You're wrong, Rennie.  You don't have to give in.  You... you are a good person.  No... you're possibly the greatest person I've ever met.  I won't let you stain your soul for anything, especially such trivial events as a silly deal with pirates."</font><br>
[Sat Aug 28 13:39:39 2004] : <B>Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>"Aryk, Aryk..." She throws up her hands in utter chagrin. "I honor your intent. Please believe that I do. But I cannot always yield to it."</font><br>

[Sat Aug 28 13:42:00 2004] : <B>Aryk</B>: <font color='#000080'>"Yes... you can!  It's only a matter of willpower... of spiritual strength!  Renate, I'm not asking you to praise Michael, or any other higher power for that matter.  I'm only asking that you have faith, you believe in yourself, and that you need only to realize that, whatever else, consorting with people like those Skyseekers back there is not the answer!"</font><br>
[Sat Aug 28 13:43:43 2004] : <B>Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>"Except when it is. And the Skyseekers, that young demon-worshipper... I don't know. There was something in his face, when he talked to you, and the tone of his voice... I don't know. I'm not sure they're quite what you think they are."</font><br>
[Sat Aug 28 13:44:32 2004] : <B>Aryk</B>: <font color='#000080'>Aryk stands and throws his hand up.  "What else is there to them?!  The worship a demon!  A DEMON!  They... they..."</font><br>

[Sat Aug 28 13:47:25 2004] : <font color='#008000'>** Aryk takes her hand, reluctant only at first. **</font><br>

[Sat Aug 28 13:51:33 2004] : <B>Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>The solid, reassuring weight of her arm encircles his shoulders. "I... I've always hoped, Aryk, that just the way nobody's all-the-way good, nobody's all-the-way bad. And I try, I try to bring out what's best in them, and to hope that it's enough, in the end, to... to make up for the rest. Because, if there's hope for them, maybe there's hope for me too."</font><br>
[Sat Aug 28 13:51:33 2004] : <font color='#008000'>** Aryk is still trying to hold back his own tears. **</font><br>

[Sat Aug 28 13:55:25 2004] : <B>Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>She takes a ragged breath. "I'm not sure how to say it, except what I said already -- you set your bar so high, and once I don't meet it, you don't give me any way back."</font><br>
[Sat Aug 28 13:55:42 2004] : <B>Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>"Rien, too -- he tries to help you, and you lash out at him for it."</font><br>

[Sat Aug 28 13:58:59 2004] : <B>Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>She is silent a long time, the tears falling soundlessly. At last, she says, "I don't know that that's my fate, Aryk. You might indeed do better to kill me."</font><br>
[Sat Aug 28 13:59:32 2004] : <B>Aryk</B>: <font color='#000080'>"Don't say that Renate.  Don't even think it.  It's not true."</font><br>

[Sat Aug 28 14:05:31 2004] : <B>Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>"I saw her at trial. She looked alone, and frightened, and there were bruises on her wrists, I don't know how they got there, she wasn't chained. She looked -- empty. I couldn't just let it go. So I wrote to her."</font><br>
[Sat Aug 28 14:05:55 2004] : <B>Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>"Three times now. I haven't heard back yet, but there hasn't been much time."</font><br>
[Sat Aug 28 14:07:35 2004] : <B>Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>She chuckles through her tears, unexpectedly. "You know, this conversation scarily starts to resemble one I had with Talos Clybourne."</font><br>
[Sat Aug 28 14:08:00 2004] : <B>Aryk</B>: <font color='#000080'>"...You're just confused.  You don't understand... that's all."</font><br>
[Sat Aug 28 14:08:12 2004] : <B>Aryk</B>: <font color='#000080'>"...what conversation?"</font><br>
[Sat Aug 28 14:09:59 2004] : <B>Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>"About the shelter. I asked him to look after it while I was gone. He gave me a lot of grief over it, thought it was a stupid idea, though he was too polite to say so outright. Because, you know, the Angelwatch beggars, Talos thinks they're hopeless cases. Worthless, past redemption. I just don't understand that. He said that to me too, that I didn't understand."</font><br>
[Sat Aug 28 14:10:37 2004] : <B>Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>(hm, slight edit: "I just don't understand that, he told me.")</font><br>
[Sat Aug 28 14:13:22 2004] : <B>Aryk</B>: <font color='#000080'>"Well... listen... maybe no one has ever expressed it thoroughly enough to you that... well... eternal damnation is FOREVER.  Mia Schala has hurt many, killed many, corrupted many, and if all she has are a few bruises, she's getting off too light.  But when judgement falls upon her, she'll get what is coming to her.  Renate, when that time comes for you, I've always had faith that you will not be going the same route Miah will.  I'll do everything in my power to see to it.  Rien as well."</font><br>
[Sat Aug 28 14:14:13 2004] : <B>Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>"And you know for certain that she is damned?" Renate asks. "I don't."</font><br>
[Sat Aug 28 14:14:52 2004] : <B>Aryk</B>: <font color='#000080'>"Of course she is!  How could you even...."  Aryk stops himself.  "I know that she is, yes."</font><br>
[Sat Aug 28 14:16:52 2004] : <B>Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>"Then I am too," Renate says, with finality. "Before I am done, I will hurt many, kill many, possibly corrupt many, though I dearly hope not... If there is no hope for Mia, then there can be none for me. I will fall with her to hell, if there is no redemption."</font><br>
[Sat Aug 28 14:17:27 2004] : <B>Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>"I'd rather think that there is hope for Mia. So I write."</font><br>
[Sat Aug 28 14:19:23 2004] : <B>Aryk</B>: <font color='#000080'>"I don't get it.  Mia willingly worships an archdemon.  Just because she's in prison now, she will obviously not stop doing so.  If anything, she'll do it moreso.  You are completely different, Rennie.  You do those things for greater purposes than she, not through evil intent.  As I do."</font><br>
[Sat Aug 28 14:20:56 2004] : <B>Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>Renate shrugs. "I hear rumors, mostly through Specs. I'm not totally sure what Mia's up to, but word is Artagus isn't involved. And what do you know about her purposes, anyway? Who else ever did anything for the kids in Everhardt Towers?"</font><br>
[Sat Aug 28 14:22:05 2004] : <B>Aryk</B>: <font color='#000080'>"Hah.  She was only empowering those people to uprise and commit acts of sin so that she and her disciples could reap the rewards in the name of the Ruido Grande."</font><br>
[Sat Aug 28 14:22:45 2004] : <B>Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>"Well, partly, yes," Renate acknowledges.</font><br>
[Sat Aug 28 14:22:51 2004] : <B>Aryk</B>: <font color='#000080'>"And the children in Everhardt are alwasy welcome to the Church of Michael."</font><br>
[Sat Aug 28 14:23:40 2004] : <B>Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>"Are they? You'd better ask your superiors about that. And you might want to ask why the Church of Raphael is held in scant esteem by the poor."</font><br>
[Sat Aug 28 14:25:16 2004] : <B>Aryk</B>: <font color='#000080'>"... I will," Aryk says, after some deliberation.  "Renate... maybe you are the better person, because you try you damndest to see the good even in people who there apparantly is none.  But... I think we are both right..."</font><br>
[Sat Aug 28 14:26:20 2004] : <B>Aryk</B>: <font color='#000080'>"The world needs people like you.  It needs people like me too.  And people like Rien, who are undecided on the whole ordeal.  I can see that now."</font><br>
[Sat Aug 28 14:27:30 2004] : <B>Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>She shrugs. "You, and Talos... if there's a man overboard, drowning, you'll assume it's his fault he fell and yell at him to swim faster. Me -- I'd rather throw a rope. That's the difference between us. I'm not sure it's reconcilable."</font><br>
[Sat Aug 28 14:28:07 2004] : <B>Aryk</B>: <font color='#000080'>"You're wrong about me, there Renate.  I'd dive in head first to save him."</font><br>
[Sat Aug 28 14:28:34 2004] : <B>Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>"And yet you've abandoned Mia to drowning."</font><br>
[Sat Aug 28 14:28:47 2004] : <B>Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>"And you want me to do likewise."</font><br>
[Sat Aug 28 14:29:25 2004] : <B>Aryk</B>: <font color='#000080'>Aryk sighs.  "She's lucky to be alive at all."</font><br>
[Sat Aug 28 14:30:25 2004] : <B>Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>"Yes. So am I, for that matter. Weirdest thing -- huge dragon, fiery breath, razor-sharp claws, and I come out of it without so much as a scratch. What are the odds?"</font><br>
[Sat Aug 28 14:32:47 2004] : <B>Aryk</B>: <font color='#000080'>"I meant she's lucky to be alive, because I'd have killed her.  It's what I do."  "Renate, I thought I had been trying to help you and Rien.  I know now that I have only been doing wrong.  For that, I'm sorry.  I only intended to do what I know is best for my friends."</font><br>
[Sat Aug 28 14:33:44 2004] : <font color='#0000ff'>Trancey Rien (enter): 14:33</font><br>
[Sat Aug 28 14:34:01 2004] : <B>Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>"No, no." She puts her arm around him again, pulling him close. "You have good instincts. Don't ever lose them."</font><br>
[Sat Aug 28 14:34:30 2004] : <B>Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>"But... I think you might want to talk to Old Wolf. About another assignment."</font><br>
[Sat Aug 28 14:35:09 2004] : <B>Aryk</B>: <font color='#000080'>"You mean...?"</font><br>
[Sat Aug 28 14:36:32 2004] : <B>Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>"I mean... you're right, that I put you in an intolerable situation. I gave you an out at the beginning and you volunteered anyway, but never mind that. It's only going to happen again and again, Aryk; I live in a gray world. I don't want to put you through that. It doesn't feel right."</font><br>
[Sat Aug 28 14:37:04 2004] : <B>Aryk</B>: <font color='#000080'>"You want me to leave, is that it?"</font><br>
[Sat Aug 28 14:38:04 2004] : <B>Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>"No. That's not it. Saints and angels, Aryk, do you really think I *want* to lose another brother?" Her voice cracks wide open; she has to hide her face in his shoulder.</font><br>
[Sat Aug 28 14:38:24 2004] : <B>Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>"I failed him. I'm failing you. That's all I'm saying."</font><br>
[Sat Aug 28 14:40:51 2004] : <B>Aryk</B>: <font color='#000080'>"No, Rennie..."  Aryk cradles her.  She can feel a teardrop fall onto the back of her neck.  "Rennie... for you... I'd... do anything.  Don't you understand that?  You haven't failed your brother.  He's out there somewhere, and the three of us will find him together.  Perhaps... I have failed you just as much as you have me."</font><br>
[Sat Aug 28 14:42:00 2004] : <B>Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>She puts him away from her, without force. "Well, you did almost ruin everything I went to the island to do."</font><br>
[Sat Aug 28 14:43:37 2004] : <B>Aryk</B>: <font color='#000080'>"...I know.  I'm sorry.  I've... come to the conclusion... thinking alone last night... that I haven't the foggiest what the world is really like.  I've been trying to live through the ideal life that I created for myself, dreaming of glory and truth in Seminary."</font><br>
[Sat Aug 28 14:43:58 2004] : <B>Aryk</B>: <font color='#000080'>"I can make a promise to you,... if you can to me?"</font><br>
[Sat Aug 28 14:44:28 2004] : <B>Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>"I don't know, Aryk. You've made promises of loyalty to me before, and broken them... and I'm afraid of what you'll make me promise."</font><br>
[Sat Aug 28 14:44:56 2004] : <B>Aryk</B>: <font color='#000080'>"Man, that really makes me sound like a complete ass, doesn't it?"</font><br>
[Sat Aug 28 14:45:21 2004] : <B>Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>"It's not for me to say. I'm a long way from perfect myself."</font><br>
[Sat Aug 28 14:46:25 2004] : <B>Aryk</B>: <font color='#000080'>"Hear me out.  I promise, Renate Von Alder, my sister, that I will strive to be more open to... the world... in all it's aspects... if you can promise to me... that whenever you think about consorting with evil, at least let me know first?!"</font><br>
[Sat Aug 28 14:47:43 2004] : <B>Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>A startled laugh gets all mixed up with a sob in her throat; the resulting sound defies description. "I can promise I'll *try*, Aryk -- but I didn't see the Skyseekers coming either!"</font><br>
[Sat Aug 28 14:48:12 2004] : <B>Aryk</B>: <font color='#000080'>Aryk sniggers.  "I know, I know.  But it's a start, for both of us, isn't it?"</font><br>
[Sat Aug 28 14:49:33 2004] : <B>Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>"I -- I hope so. Because I really *don't* want to lose you, Aryk Lazarus, my brother, even if something somewhere under my ribs says it'd be the best thing for you."</font><br>
[Sat Aug 28 14:50:50 2004] : <B>Aryk</B>: <font color='#000080'>"Right now, I think the best thing for me is a tankard.  Join me for a drink?  I know it's still morning, but hey..."</font><br>
[Sat Aug 28 14:52:10 2004] : <B>Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>"Mm, no thanks. I'm hungry, though. It's hard to make myself eat when I know there's unfinished business around. And I had a terrible day with Rien... I'm starving. So you drink, you drunken gambling wenching swearing paladin, you, and I'll eat."</font><br>
[Sat Aug 28 14:53:21 2004] : <B>Aryk</B>: <font color='#000080'>"Suit yourself.  Hmm... speaking of Rien... since I can't get you to 'see the light,'... Aryk grins, "I'll have to work on him..."</font><br>
[Sat Aug 28 14:53:41 2004] : <B>Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>"Good luck. I think he's awake by now. Might even be looking for breakfast himself. Want to go see?"</font><br>
[Sat Aug 28 14:54:01 2004] : <B>Aryk</B>: <font color='#000080'>Aryk nods.  "I'd like that."</font><br>
[Sat Aug 28 14:54:26 2004] : <B>Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>"Right, then. Galley-ho!" She wipes her face on the too-large sleeve, turns her collar back up and buttons it properly, and leads the way.</font><br>
