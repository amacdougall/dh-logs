[Fri Aug 25 20:12:47 2006] : <B>(1) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>The door you just came through isn't locked from the other side; you just push a bar and it opens.</font><br>

[Fri Aug 25 20:17:20 2006] : <B>(1) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>The door can't open until the other door is shut; once you do, there's a change in air pressure and temperature.</font><br>

[Fri Aug 25 23:47:15 2006] : <font color='#008000'>** (3) Renate tangles one leg in the rope, to stay attached. **</font><br>
[Fri Aug 25 23:48:18 2006] : <font color='#008000'>** (4) Aryk holds his attack, still a large leaping distance away from Forengil.  His teeth are gritted so hard his head throbs. **</font><br>
