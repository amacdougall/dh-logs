[Fri Aug 26 19:17:20 2005] : <B>(3) Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>"Hm. Then we can't follow Templeton and Randall unless we follow the Cardinals. Which we are too late to do at present."</font><br>

[Fri Aug 26 19:19:26 2005] : <B>(1) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>Sabra is speaking to contacts within the Five Grands, to see if the higher levels know anything.</font><br>
[Fri Aug 26 19:19:48 2005] : <B>(1) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>At the Five Grands, vice and finance are mixed smoothly enough that it's hard to tell who is a criminal.</font><br>
[Fri Aug 26 19:19:52 2005] : <B>(3) Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>"Sabra's casing the casinos. But Rien's right; finding the Cardinal base, which is likely deserted, is another potential option."</font><br>

[Fri Aug 26 19:21:47 2005] : <B>(2) Aryk</B>: <font color='#000080'>"Right.  In that case, maybe we should find out where the Cardinals' base is.  If anything, Bazz would probably know, but if we run into another streeter, they could probably tell us.  I, um, would prefer to avoid Jaguero's, if possible."</font><br>

[Fri Aug 26 19:24:51 2005] : <B>(1) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>The seven form with military precision into a loose semicircle surrounding Aryk, and in unison, tilt back their beer bottles and drain them.</font><br>
