[Sat Jul 17 22:22:36 2004] : <B>Aryk</B>: <font color='#000080'>See, that's right were I stopped.  Well, like I was gonna say before, I don't think Sashi will have to worry.  One because Aryk is going to be following more and more the path of righteousness, and two, I'm going to be having him have thoughts about Emily Raini more and more frequently</font><br>
[Sat Jul 17 22:22:37 2004] : <B>Dorothea</B>: <font color='#000080'>Plumbing is pretty immaterial.</font><br>

[Sat Jul 17 22:23:38 2004] : <B>Dorothea</B>: <font color='#000080'>indeed... well, we are assured of seeing her again</font><br>
[Sat Jul 17 22:23:45 2004] : <B>Rien</B>: <font color='#804040'>Meanwhile though...Aryk is going to have some learning to do regarding Sashi though if she;s going to fit well into the group</font><br>

[Sat Jul 17 22:24:40 2004] : <B>Rien</B>: <font color='#804040'>she's a mute</font><br>
[Sat Jul 17 22:24:56 2004] : <B>Dorothea</B>: <font color='#000080'>or Sashi will have to learn to write</font><br>
