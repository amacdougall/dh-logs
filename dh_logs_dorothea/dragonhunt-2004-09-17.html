[Fri Sep 17 18:13:45 2004] : <B>Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>The Shelton Memorial Stadium is a smallish venue, no larger than a mid-sized theater; but on this, the final night of the Saffold-Marman Invitational Cooking Tournament, it has all the electricity and tension of the Iron Ring during Time for Fighting Time.</font><br>
[Fri Sep 17 18:14:42 2004] : <B>Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>So far, Coris's men have had nothing to do besides stalk around vigilantly: through two one-hour matches, every eye in the house has been fixed raptly on the contestants.</font><br>
[Fri Sep 17 18:15:43 2004] : <B>Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>First, Carragio LaPlace won a battle against an Eastlands/Erethan gourmet on sheer guts and willpower.</font><br>
[Fri Sep 17 18:16:23 2004] : <B>Aryk</B>: <font color='#000080'>"DO IT, CARRAGIO!!"</font><br>
[Fri Sep 17 18:16:40 2004] : <B>Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>In the face of demonically elaborate tarts and risottos, and a seafood soup prepared as if by the True King himself, Carragio could only stand firm and say to the front-row reporter: "These will be the best noodles I've ever cooked."</font><br>
[Fri Sep 17 18:17:55 2004] : <B>Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>In the next round, which decided the other half of the final match, Carragio's Xanadu archnemesis whirled into action, unique new styles of cooking extending like mechanical arms.</font><br>
[Fri Sep 17 18:19:00 2004] : <B>Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>The opponent was a master of vegetables, said to be able to convince a wolf to give up venison&#8212;but the Xanadu master tauntingly matched the upstart's entree with a meatless lasagna one of the judges described as "a revelation of religious proportions."</font><br>
[Fri Sep 17 18:19:46 2004] : <B>Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>From her vantage near Carragio -- she has appointed herself his personal bodyguard for the duration of the contest -- Renate winces at that.</font><br>

[Fri Sep 17 18:20:10 2004] : <B>Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>And so the die was rolled&#8212;and now, in the final fifteen minutes of the match, when each chef and his assistants pour on steam to complete their dishes by the final gong, the audience is clapping rhythmically, yelling cheers for their favorites.</font><br>
[Fri Sep 17 18:20:46 2004] : <B>Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>The Xanadu "restaurant magnate" in the opposing VIP box glowers mercilessly at Carragio; Carragio, in his turn, glanced only once in that direction, and returned to his work pale and cold despite the fierce heat of a dozen cooking stones.</font><br>

[Fri Sep 17 18:22:09 2004] : <B>Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>Carragio has pulled out all the stops of the organ, a procedure which in music produces thunderous discord; in cooking, it means a tiltingly risky combination of the hearty lunch-counter hotpots he's loved for, and extravagant gourmet decoctions spiced with substances only chefs and natural philosophers know in detail.</font><br>
[Fri Sep 17 18:22:42 2004] : <B>Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>The Xanadu chef feels the pressure to succeed as well&#8212;his life may not be at stake, but his reputation is, and he is dueling with every attack in his repertoire.</font><br>
[Fri Sep 17 18:23:27 2004] : <B>Aryk</B>: <font color='#000080'>"CARRAGIO DON'T SWEAT IT!  ANYBODY TRIES ANYTHING, THEY'LL GET A BEATDOWN, DIRTY FIFTH-STYLE!"</font><br>

[Fri Sep 17 21:25:24 2004] : <B>Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>Who's to say everyone dies? I'm sure there's some way to get Aryk out of that rock.</font><br>
[Fri Sep 17 21:25:30 2004] : <B>Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>What. A. Bastard.</font><br>
[Fri Sep 17 21:25:39 2004] : <B>Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>The implications are just staggering.</font><br>
[Fri Sep 17 21:25:52 2004] : <B>Aryk</B>: <font color='#000080'>Aren't they though?</font><br>
[Fri Sep 17 21:26:02 2004] : <B>Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>I'm going to go out on a limb here and say that with Dark Eternal unlocking Rien's true powers, it's not our heroes who have anything (immediate) to worry about.</font><br>
[Fri Sep 17 21:26:04 2004] : <B>Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>(well, Rien has earth magic; I'm sure he can reverse the transmute and pull Aryk out.)</font><br>
[Fri Sep 17 21:26:06 2004] : <B>Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>Long term is another story.</font><br>
[Fri Sep 17 21:26:19 2004] : <B>Rien</B>: <font color='#004040'>I wonder if this is going otbe the vent that will force Rien to reveal who his adopted father is</font><br>
[Fri Sep 17 21:26:38 2004] : <B>Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>It's definitely the one that will leave Rien and Trancey united. Maybe not happy with themselves, though.</font><br>
[Fri Sep 17 21:26:48 2004] : <B>Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>In fact, I just had an idea, but I guess I have to keep it quiet.</font><br>
[Fri Sep 17 21:26:55 2004] : <B>Rien</B>: <font color='#004040'>definately not for being used like that</font><br>
[Fri Sep 17 21:26:56 2004] : <B>Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>After this, perhaps you could go talk to &#196;nder Kurtzveil again.</font><br>
[Fri Sep 17 21:27:10 2004] : <B>Rien</B>: <font color='#004040'>hmmmm...*if* I can find him that is</font><br>
[Fri Sep 17 21:27:16 2004] : <B>Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>Renate and Aryk will be going on separate side quests; I think Rien should have one, too.</font><br>
[Fri Sep 17 21:27:20 2004] : <B>Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>this would be the "kick that motherfucking dragon out of my mind" talk?</font><br>
[Fri Sep 17 21:27:28 2004] : <B>Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>To find out how he's been used, and how to prevent it in the future, right.</font><br>
[Fri Sep 17 21:27:55 2004] : <B>Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>Dark Eternal's not done with Rien, but after the side quest he'll at least be done with using him like a hammer.</font><br>
[Fri Sep 17 21:27:58 2004] : <B>Rien</B>: <font color='#004040'>what would be even more interesting would be to reverse the link and control DE for a while</font><br>
[Fri Sep 17 21:28:05 2004] : <B>Rien</B>: <font color='#004040'>ala Hogfather</font><br>
[Fri Sep 17 21:28:13 2004] : <B>Aryk</B>: <font color='#000080'>Well, slap my face and call me Lucy.  </font><br>
[Fri Sep 17 21:28:19 2004] : <B>Aryk</B>: <font color='#000080'>Heh, that would be awesome, Adrian.</font><br>
[Fri Sep 17 21:28:23 2004] : <font color='#008000'>** Rien slaps Lucy **</font><br>
[Fri Sep 17 21:28:43 2004] : <B>Aryk</B>: <font color='#000080'>Alright, guys, I'm going to call it a night and mourn for my character.</font><br>
[Fri Sep 17 21:28:54 2004] : <B>Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>Aw, we'll get you out, hon.</font><br>
[Fri Sep 17 21:29:06 2004] : <B>Aryk</B>: <font color='#000080'>Nope, we're all gonna die.</font><br>
[Fri Sep 17 21:29:13 2004] : <B>Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>cut that out! that's my line!</font><br>
[Fri Sep 17 21:29:25 2004] : <B>Aryk</B>: <font color='#000080'>Game over man!  Game over!</font><br>
[Fri Sep 17 21:29:25 2004] : <B>Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>and yes, we are all going to die... just not now.</font><br>
[Fri Sep 17 21:29:40 2004] : <B>Aryk</B>: <font color='#000080'>Good session, Alan.</font><br>
[Fri Sep 17 21:29:46 2004] : <B>Rien</B>: <font color='#004040'>indeed</font><br>
[Fri Sep 17 21:29:52 2004] : <B>Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>Yep. Enjoying watching us oscillate over it?</font><br>
[Fri Sep 17 21:30:05 2004] : <B>Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>Oh, absolutely.</font><br>
[Fri Sep 17 21:30:10 2004] : <B>Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>This was one of the "big plot twists."</font><br>
[Fri Sep 17 21:30:18 2004] : <B>Aryk</B>: <font color='#000080'>Heh heh.  </font><br>
[Fri Sep 17 21:30:20 2004] : <B>Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>Yeah, that one is a RIGHT pisser.</font><br>
[Fri Sep 17 21:30:22 2004] : <B>Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>Next biggie is Chapter 10.</font><br>
[Fri Sep 17 21:30:22 2004] : <B>Rien</B>: <font color='#004040'>and we all know that if something happens to prevent me attending next weeks session I'm going to be most vexed now :)</font><br>
[Fri Sep 17 21:30:35 2004] : <B>Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>I'm very glad Renate didn't sleep with Rien, or she'd just plain have to drown herself.</font><br>
[Fri Sep 17 21:30:45 2004] : <B>Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>Although Chapter 6 has a twist, too... in fact, lemme put up the teaser now.</font><br>
[Fri Sep 17 21:30:55 2004] : <B>Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>Opening HTML editor....</font><br>
[Fri Sep 17 21:31:06 2004] : <B>Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>That's just.... ew.</font><br>
[Fri Sep 17 21:31:29 2004] : <B>Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>That's damn close to "I'm swearing off sex for life" ew.</font><br>
[Fri Sep 17 21:31:51 2004] : <B>Rien</B>: <font color='#004040'>thaaaaanks</font><br>
[Fri Sep 17 21:31:53 2004] : <B>Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>In fact, now that I think about it? EW.</font><br>
[Fri Sep 17 21:32:12 2004] : <B>Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>Well, I mean, jeez, sleeping with part of Dark Eternal? EEEEEEEEEEEEW.</font><br>
[Fri Sep 17 21:32:38 2004] : <B>Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>Like Hartman said, it ain't personal.</font><br>
[Fri Sep 17 21:32:41 2004] : <B>Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>It's just EW.</font><br>
[Fri Sep 17 21:33:02 2004] : <B>Aryk</B>: <font color='#000080'>[1d6] -> [6] = (6)</font><br>
[Fri Sep 17 21:33:07 2004] : <B>Aryk</B>: <font color='#000080'>I don't get it.</font><br>
[Fri Sep 17 21:34:00 2004] : <B>Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>What's not to get? DE left a little bit of something in Rien's mind; this was the 'third personality' that Lionheart found out about.</font><br>
[Fri Sep 17 21:34:30 2004] : <B>Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>And Rien is DE's sneak weapon... one of them, anyhow.</font><br>
[Fri Sep 17 21:34:38 2004] : <B>Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>Seriously doubt he's the only one.</font><br>
[Fri Sep 17 21:35:03 2004] : <B>Aryk</B>: <font color='#000080'>Oops, I missed the line about sleeping together.  Anyways, I'm outta here.</font><br>
[Fri Sep 17 21:35:05 2004] : <B>Rien</B>: <font color='#004040'>but I was right when I said that if there was a third personality and neither of the other two had ever noticed it it must be the dominant one</font><br>
[Fri Sep 17 21:35:13 2004] : <B>Aryk</B>: <font color='#000080'>My eyes are bulging out of my skull.</font><br>
[Fri Sep 17 21:35:14 2004] : <B>Rien</B>: <font color='#004040'>bye matt</font><br>

[Fri Sep 17 21:37:05 2004] : <B>Rien</B>: <font color='#004040'>Oh we *do* do we?</font><br>
[Fri Sep 17 21:37:16 2004] : <B>Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>There'll be reasons.</font><br>

[Fri Sep 17 21:37:32 2004] : <B>Aryk</B>: <font color='#000080'>That's harsh.  Didn't expect this kind of thing so soon.</font><br>

[Fri Sep 17 21:38:09 2004] : <B>Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>*shrug* This has the flavor of a "greater threat" plot.</font><br>

[Fri Sep 17 21:38:44 2004] : <B>Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>I bet I can go from Chapter 5 wrapup to Chapter 6 intro next session, so you'll see then.</font><br>
[Fri Sep 17 21:38:49 2004] : <B>Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>*shrug* Or DE's got the three of us locked up in Gereval.</font><br>
