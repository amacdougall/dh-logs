[Fri Aug  3 20:50:25 2007] : <b>(1061) Alan</b>: <font color='#000080'>Well, assuming. The magical siege is ongoing: Evantin Barious is not personally casting spells right now, but his students are maintaining a ritual magic he set up that is slowly boring through the distance distortion spell that prevents the Blizzard King's army from advancing.</font><br />
[Fri Aug  3 20:51:05 2007] : <b>(1061) Alan</b>: <font color='#000080'>The distance distortion spell is being maintained by mana tapped by the ley lines from Chapbrook and focused and conditioned in the remaining mana batteries in the keep.</font><br />
[Fri Aug  3 20:52:00 2007] : <b>(1061) Alan</b>: <font color='#000080'>If Chapbrook had fallen, the mana batteries alone would not have sustained the spell, but as it is, it looks like it will take the enemy days to drill through; once they realize that Chroma failed after ordering Leonid to retreat, they will probably have to reconsider their strategy.</font><br />
[Fri Aug  3 20:52:39 2007] : <b>(1061) Alan</b>: <font color='#000080'>Rien can't get into the keep itself to talk to the defenders; Margadas's army is too thick on the ground.</font><br />
[Fri Aug  3 20:53:24 2007] : <b>(1063) Rien</b>: <font color='#5e5b33'>So there's no point in the Spirit Realm that will allow him to drop back down into an area inside the curtain wall?</font><br />
[Fri Aug  3 20:54:13 2007] : <b>(1061) Alan</b>: <font color='#000080'>You could go up around the way you left, along the arroyos and up to the plateau.</font><br />
[Fri Aug  3 20:54:21 2007] : <b>(1061) Alan</b>: <font color='#000080'>That would take a while though if you're just scouting.</font><br />

[Fri Aug  3 20:59:11 2007] : <b>(1061) Alan</b>: <font color='#000080'>Rainstone is coming to just about now. I kinda, uh, forgot about him.</font><br />

[Fri Aug  3 21:01:12 2007] : <b>(1062) Renate</b>: <font color='#000080'>That's for later.</font><br />
[Fri Aug  3 21:01:35 2007] : <b>(1063) Rien</b>: <font color='#5e5b33'>Once Rien's out of the danger-zone about half his mind will be devoted to planning new moves and figuring stuff out, and the rest wholly devoted to thoughts of getting back to Renate.</font><br />
[Fri Aug  3 21:01:56 2007] : <b>(1062) Renate</b>: <font color='#000080'>Right now it's for the "I have barely slept in three days, I've been killed twice over, I have no blankets or other sleeping gear, and I'm dead tired" blues.</font><br />

[Fri Aug  3 21:03:04 2007] : <b>(1061) Alan</b>: <font color='#000080'>Later we'll get into how much you remember or can still use.</font><br />

[Fri Aug  3 21:04:46 2007] : <b>(1063) Rien</b>: <font color='#5e5b33'>This is assuming Renate <i>wants</i> them.</font><br />
[Fri Aug  3 21:04:53 2007] : <b>(1062) Renate</b>: <font color='#000080'>Well, she should at least get a Warcraft bump against Eternal Capital.</font><br />
[Fri Aug  3 21:05:33 2007] : <b>(1061) Alan</b>: <font color='#000080'>Oh, definitely.</font><br />
[Fri Aug  3 21:06:00 2007] : <b>(1061) Alan</b>: <font color='#000080'>And I'm thinking more in terms of physical memory she could use to work with Daniel to develop a version of Wrenfall more powerful than Renate's but less dangerous than his.</font><br />
[Fri Aug  3 21:06:29 2007] : <b>(1062) Renate</b>: <font color='#000080'>I like that. Those two should definitely learn together.</font><br />
[Fri Aug  3 21:06:32 2007] : <b>(1061) Alan</b>: <font color='#000080'>The way Aaron originally wrote it, Wrenfall wasn't meant to be fighting dragons with.</font><br />
[Fri Aug  3 21:06:57 2007] : <b>(1061) Alan</b>: <font color='#000080'>It was meant to fight relatively normal people, while teaching the user important zen-ish life lessons.</font><br />
[Fri Aug  3 21:07:19 2007] : <b>(1062) Renate</b>: <font color='#000080'>So they sent Renate out into the world by herself, WTF did they think she'd end up doing?</font><br />
[Fri Aug  3 21:07:43 2007] : <b>(1062) Renate</b>: <font color='#000080'>Though Rennie is a good girl and has perhaps exceeded expectations.</font><br />
[Fri Aug  3 21:07:55 2007] : <b>(1062) Renate</b>: <font color='#000080'>Little though she herself would suspect that.</font><br />
[Fri Aug  3 21:08:30 2007] : <b>(1065) Aryk</b>: <font color='#710000'>Renate and Daniel can train together, Aryk and Emily can train together, and Rien can be like, "oh, it's cool.  I'm already badass."</font><br />
[Fri Aug  3 21:08:50 2007] : <b>(1061) Alan</b>: <font color='#000080'>Emily already used two Sacred Flame moves in the fight.</font><br />
[Fri Aug  3 21:08:57 2007] : <b>(1061) Alan</b>: <font color='#000080'>She picks up anything useful, from anywhere.</font><br />

[Fri Aug  3 21:09:47 2007] : <b>(1061) Alan</b>: <font color='#000080'>She could run a nice little scam using some Black Inferno and some Sacred Flame, with both patrons trying to make their moves more useful to win her over.</font><br />

[Fri Aug  3 21:10:38 2007] : <b>(1062) Renate</b>: <font color='#000080'>Well, it could also be the lever to get Michael and Kahan talking again.</font><br />
