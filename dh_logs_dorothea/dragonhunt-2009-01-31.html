[Sat Jan 31 00:19:44 2009] : <b>(3) Alan</b>: <font color='#000080'>Yeah, putting the dice away was the best decision I made in the game.</font><br />

[Sat Jan 31 00:24:12 2009] : <b>(4) Aryk</b>: <font color='#710000'>Oh, right.  We'll see.  It's not that Aryk needs to do soul-searching, per say, but I think he's going to have to redeem himself in his own eyes most of all before he's ready to rejoin his friends.  Of course, if that gets resolved here and now, he may come to that sooner than later.</font><br />

[Sat Jan 31 01:54:01 2009] : <b>(1) Rien</b>: <font color='#003300'>Piles taper towards the top, so work from the tip and grab as much as he can.  After all, he moved half a hillside when he was up against Chroma.</font><br />
[Sat Jan 31 01:55:38 2009] : <b>(3) Alan</b>: <font color='#000080'>Well, moving that much in this case would be disastrous, because you'd be trying to teleport rock into rock.</font><br />
[Sat Jan 31 01:55:45 2009] : <b>(3) Alan</b>: <font color='#000080'>Extreme misfortune would result.</font><br />

[Sat Jan 31 01:58:20 2009] : <b>(3) Alan</b>: <font color='#000080'>There's definitely still a downward force from above; as he teleports more and more of the pile away, rushes of rock fall down from the hole in the ceiling to fill their place.</font><br />
[Sat Jan 31 01:58:46 2009] : <b>(3) Alan</b>: <font color='#000080'>It seems like you'd need some sort of support on the ceiling to shore it up.</font><br />
[Sat Jan 31 01:59:30 2009] : <b>(3) Alan</b>: <font color='#000080'>Or, thinking outside the box, you could somehow get the rock somewhere else until the entire volume is removed.</font><br />

[Sat Jan 31 02:06:14 2009] : <b>(3) Alan</b>: <font color='#000080'>Wouldn't have to be huge; just enough to "drain off" the falling rock until the ceiling reaches some sort of equilibrium.</font><br />
[Sat Jan 31 02:06:42 2009] : <b>(3) Alan</b>: <font color='#000080'>Maybe the rock is stable at a certain point above you, and you just need to remove that much rock.</font><br />
[Sat Jan 31 02:08:26 2009] : <b>(3) Alan</b>: <font color='#000080'>It would be tricky; he can still only open portals in open air.</font><br />
[Sat Jan 31 02:08:43 2009] : <b>(3) Alan</b>: <font color='#000080'>So he'd have to position-switch with rock and open a portal right above him immediately afterward; a risky proposition at best.</font><br />
