[Sun Feb 08 19:58:06 2004] : <B>(1) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>And then the crystal ceases its gentle glow, and you awake.</font><br>
[Sun Feb 08 19:58:22 2004] : <B>(1) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>Your memories aren't real; that much is obvious. You don't have a sense of actually being at any of these events.</font><br>
