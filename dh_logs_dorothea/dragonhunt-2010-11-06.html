[Sat Nov  6 19:44:28 2010] : <b>(5508) Alan</b>: <font color='#000080'>"I put it about that I was looking for a good war, and of course there was a lot of talk about Heliomere's drive, but also a half-dozen other regional brushfires."

[Sat Nov  6 19:44:49 2010] : <b>(5505) Renate</b>: <font color='#000080'>"Hm. Did he recognize you at all? Considering that Heliomere's last army nearly killed you."</font><br />

[Sat Nov  6 19:52:04 2010] : <b>(5508) Alan</b>: <font color='#000080'>Lehron speaks up. "I got a glimpse of that Hojo. Huge hobgoblin, like a brick wall. He was drunk at noon, which is no wonder in this town. But he holds it something fierce. He was taking fights at one to three copper odds.

To Lehron, he says, "Creed told me he was who he talked do often when dealing with Heliomere.  Might be high up on the food chain."  To all, he says, "So far, I'm thinking Daniel, you should keep doing what you're doing, and Lehron, I'd like you to continue to work with him.  Let's rope this Duane guy in.  Rien, I'd like you and Gravin to track down this mage.  I think Emily, Renate, and I are going to look up this Hojo."</font><br />
