Renate thinks that the next attacks may be on Carrackshire or Margolin, and I think she may be right.  We need to return soon.  So we're leaving Brosford in your hands, Ms. Stone.

[Sat Dec 18 20:53:04 2010] : <b>(7262) Aryk</b>: <font color='#800000'>Well, had Aryk and Renate's roles been reversed, it would have been the same.  She would have left pissed, and he would have been somewhat satisfied with the outcome.</font><br />
