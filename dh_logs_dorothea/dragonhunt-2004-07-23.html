[Fri Jul 23 18:22:25 2004] : <B>Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>Hm... if you had a momentary slowdown when it started up, it's probably just that you had to download the map again.</font><br>

[Fri Jul 23 18:22:40 2004] : <B>Aryk</B>: <font color='#000080'>Could be.</font><br>

[Fri Jul 23 18:25:58 2004] : <B>Aryk</B>: <font color='#000080'>Well, yeah, I think we left off in back in the main hall shortly after we brought Rien back outta the orchard.  Of course, you guys had that fluff piece with Rien and Sabine, so perhaps we could say that has happened and we could pick up shortly thereafter.</font><br>

[Fri Jul 23 18:32:56 2004] : <B>Aryk</B>: <font color='#000080'>No, just for future reference</font><br>

[Fri Jul 23 18:39:01 2004] : <B>Aryk</B>: <font color='#000080'>I'm pretty sure I recall a brief conversation where Rien mentioned it to Aryk.  I may be delirious, however.</font><br>

[Fri Jul 23 18:40:57 2004] : <B>Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>I heard an anecdote once about a DM who put two silver on a random orc encounter, and the players started wondering where they got all the money.</font><br>

[Fri Jul 23 18:41:10 2004] : <B>Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>It turned into a whole adventure.</font><br>

[Fri Jul 23 18:41:26 2004] : <B>Dorothea</B>: <font color='#000080'>I like it when little things like that get run with.</font><br>
[Fri Jul 23 18:41:55 2004] : <B>Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>Well, the DM put it out there as an example of "if you're not sure how to handle that sort of thing, put on the brakes."</font><br>
[Fri Jul 23 18:41:56 2004] : <B>Aryk</B>: <font color='#000080'>If I were DM I'd say "Let it go!  Move on!"</font><br>
[Fri Jul 23 18:42:40 2004] : <B>Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>I realized just in the last five minutes that this potion formula Trancey sketched so long ago inevitably adds a new rules element to the entire game world.</font><br>
[Fri Jul 23 18:42:41 2004] : <B>Dorothea</B>: <font color='#000080'>well, it does certainly take a bit of GM studliness to make such a thing work</font><br>
[Fri Jul 23 18:43:11 2004] : <B>Dorothea</B>: <font color='#000080'>oh, man, did Trancey bend physics <i>again</i>?</font><br>
[Fri Jul 23 18:43:11 2004] : <B>Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>Because he can't get it produced without taking it to the Alchemists, who will put it into general production due to their dragon-controller profiteering nature...</font><br>
[Fri Jul 23 18:43:17 2004] : <B>Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>...and boom, new potionlist entry...</font><br>
[Fri Jul 23 18:43:28 2004] : <B>Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>...and of course, they'll want more, and they'll want to know how Rien knows this stuff...</font><br>
[Fri Jul 23 18:43:48 2004] : <B>Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>...and it inescapably turns into a plot force that I didn't necessarily want.</font><br>
[Fri Jul 23 18:44:04 2004] : <B>Dorothea</B>: <font color='#000080'>maybe Rien should go through a proxy, then... or a rogue alchemist</font><br>
[Fri Jul 23 18:44:06 2004] : <B>Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>I can always just have someone in the guild say "nah, we'll just let it go."</font><br>
[Fri Jul 23 18:44:21 2004] : <B>Dorothea</B>: <font color='#000080'>or maybe he can just buy the ingredients and Trancey can do the mixin' up</font><br>
[Fri Jul 23 18:44:23 2004] : <B>Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>Hm, wait a second...</font><br>
[Fri Jul 23 18:44:24 2004] : <B>Rien</B>: <font color='#804040'>or have NM tell their dragon guildhead ot let it go</font><br>
[Fri Jul 23 18:44:38 2004] : <B>Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>Now that I think of it, the Silver Coast Alchemists' Guild is one of the only guilds run by mortals.</font><br>
[Fri Jul 23 18:44:48 2004] : <B>Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>They've gotten away with it because their focus isn't on "true" magic.</font><br>
[Fri Jul 23 18:45:19 2004] : <B>Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>So in that case, it's more plausible to have the incomprehensible formula get passed up to some obscure researcher in the Guild, who makes the potion out of curiosity.</font><br>
[Fri Jul 23 18:45:37 2004] : <B>Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>That's more suitable to my sensibilities. Allows me to work it either way.</font><br>
[Fri Jul 23 18:46:09 2004] : <B>Dorothea</B>: <font color='#000080'>and all this for a birthday present!</font><br>
[Fri Jul 23 18:46:11 2004] : <B>Dorothea</B>: <font color='#000080'>whew</font><br>

He does his best not to piss off the Baron and Baroness, and works up nerve to speak to Sabine coherently now and then.  He does a lot of praying.</font><br>
[Fri Jul 23 18:53:13 2004] : <B>Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>(yup)</font><br>
[Fri Jul 23 18:53:37 2004] : <B>Aryk</B>: <font color='#000080'>Overall I think this is a great time for Aryk to do some soul-searching</font><br>
[Fri Jul 23 18:53:48 2004] : <B>Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>Aryk's pretty much a hit with the locals. They've got a lot of respect for the Church in these parts, anyway, and when he wants to be, Aryk's a pleasant and clean-cut young gentleman.</font><br>

[Fri Jul 23 19:03:47 2004] : <B>Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>It's not the kind of haughty prophecy he would ever say aloud, but you've come over long years to an understanding that Aaron Wrenfall's world is indeed one of cosmic battles as well as human ones.</font><br>

[Fri Jul 23 19:07:31 2004] : <B>Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>Master Schaeffer invites the gang along on a small cattle drive at one point; he's taking them about a third of the way to Ilium, where he's merging his cattle with a larger drive where a broker will sell them at market for Ilium's Dockland slaughterhouses.</font><br>
[Fri Jul 23 19:07:53 2004] : <B>Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>Upon seeing Aryk "ride," he takes the young knight under his wing and manages to impart at least the basics of horsemanship.</font><br>

[Fri Jul 23 19:09:55 2004] : <font color='#0000ff'><i>whispering to Alan,  Renate might well let Aryk knock her over on purpose, just to bolster his confidence.</i> </font><br>
[Fri Jul 23 19:10:06 2004] : <B>Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>Tilting as a combat practice requires too much skill to be widespread outside specialized cavalry units, and jousting as a sport is more the stuff of legend than modern times.</font><br>
[Fri Jul 23 19:10:23 2004] : <B>Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>Just among the four of you. Sheer horseplay (heh).</font><br>

[Fri Jul 23 19:11:23 2004] : <B>Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>Master Schaeffer dominates the festivities; the task rewards timing and accuracy more than the more youthful attributes of our band of heroes.</font><br>
[Fri Jul 23 19:11:49 2004] : <B>Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>But the result is that Aryk is no longer completely laughable on horseback.</font><br>
[Fri Jul 23 19:12:31 2004] : <B>Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>That suits Renate fine. She's also happy to see those she thinks of as "her" people demonstrating talent and skill, and sharing same openly.</font><br>

[Fri Jul 23 21:22:00 2004] : <B>Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>The town commons are abuzz with spectators; the ranchers show off their calf-roping techniques, children chase a greased piglet, a relay race runs the outside of the town.</font><br>

[Fri Jul 23 21:29:45 2004] : <B>Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>Again, it must be confusing to Rien and Aryk how the steady steam of almost incomprehensible commands turns into an ever-changing synchronized dance.</font><br>
[Fri Jul 23 21:30:18 2004] : <B>Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>The caller's cant is half Elven, half Northrock Trade Tongue, with a smattering of held-over phrases from even before the Dragon War.</font><br>

[Fri Jul 23 21:31:31 2004] : <B>Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>It's alien to Rien, but Trancey seems to be able to get a very general gist of it after observing for a bit, and pumps a little more of that unexpected knowledge into Rien's mind.</font><br>
[Fri Jul 23 21:31:47 2004] : <B>Aryk</B>: <font color='#000080'>(Whoa, guys)</font><br>
[Fri Jul 23 21:31:50 2004] : <B>Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>Usually Rien has shocking realizations about the fractal nature of probability or equal nonsense.</font><br>
