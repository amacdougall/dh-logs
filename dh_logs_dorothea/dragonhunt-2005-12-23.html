[Fri Dec 23 19:23:42 2005] : <B>(1) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>The Golden Pine Hotel is deep into Silver Blades turf; once it was a luxury hotel, long ago, when this part of town had not been absorbed into the Clover District.</font><br>

[Fri Dec 23 19:25:11 2005] : <B>(1) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>Now, like so much in the District, it is half rotted majesty, half plywood and hex-wire, ad-hoc reinforcements layered upon one another into a sedimentary solid.</font><br>

[Fri Dec 23 19:26:15 2005] : <B>(1) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>Some rooms of this hotel seem to act as minor drug laboratories; some are barracks; some are simply blank holes, with a few squatters' nests in the corners.</font><br>
[Fri Dec 23 19:27:32 2005] : <B>(1) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>The roof has seen a battle recently; Clessgrave informed you on the way that Caxton's Coursers rule the highroad just north, patrolling their seven-block domain with war-horses better-fed and better-armed than the gang's own leaders.</font><br>
[Fri Dec 23 19:27:59 2005] : <B>(1) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>Sandbags and overturned tables line the edge of the rooftop; improvised parapets.</font><br>

[Fri Dec 23 19:29:26 2005] : <B>(1) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>However, he seems to be the only sentry, since nobody has sounded an alert to your approach.</font><br>

[Fri Dec 23 19:29:59 2005] : <B>(3) Rien</B>: <font color='#004040'>is he wearing his mask already?</font><br>
[Fri Dec 23 19:30:12 2005] : <B>(1) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>She nods, and sketches a holy sign in the air; angel wings, visible only as areas of negation, sweep over her to hide her from view.</font><br>

[Fri Dec 23 19:31:22 2005] : <B>(1) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>(Nobody else in the building seems to be awake.)</font><br>
[Fri Dec 23 19:31:30 2005] : <B>(4) Aryk</B>: <font color='#000080'>Aryk whispers, "Want me to distract him, guys?"</font><br>

[Fri Dec 23 19:31:52 2005] : <B>(2) Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>"No noise."</font><br>
[Fri Dec 23 19:32:23 2005] : <B>(1) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>The Red Mask grunts as his head jerks back; Clessgrave becomes visible, holding him in a practiced sleeper hold.</font><br>

[Fri Dec 23 19:32:55 2005] : <B>(1) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>He flails, but isn't able to get balance to reverse her attack, and after long seconds, his motions grow weaker and weaker.</font><br>
[Fri Dec 23 19:33:15 2005] : <B>(1) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>Mia scuttles toward the air vent hood. "It's bolted down. Renate, your tools?"</font><br>
[Fri Dec 23 19:33:54 2005] : <font color='#008000'>** (2) Renate tosses her the metal object without comment. **</font><br>
[Fri Dec 23 19:34:12 2005] : <B>(1) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>Clessgrave releases the Red Mask a few seconds after his struggles stop. "I don't do that too often, so I'm not positive when he'll recover. Too long and I'd kill him, so I took it easy."</font><br>
[Fri Dec 23 19:34:16 2005] : <B>(4) Aryk</B>: <font color='#000080'>"That was sweet!"  Aryk whispers excitedly, watching the Mask's body twitch it's last twitch.</font><br>

[Fri Dec 23 19:34:41 2005] : <B>(1) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>Mia unscrews the bolts and lifts the hood.</font><br>
[Fri Dec 23 19:34:58 2005] : <B>(1) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>"It's a bad habit to get into," Clessgrave says, somewhere between piety and irony.</font><br>
[Fri Dec 23 19:35:14 2005] : <B>(1) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>"Here it is. One to go." She performs the blood ritual a fifth time.</font><br>
[Fri Dec 23 19:35:16 2005] : <B>(2) Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>"Hush," Renate warns. "And stay down; could be more of them." She measures the Red Mask's body with her eyes, and stands on a sandbag approximately where he had been, aping his stance and movements.</font><br>
[Fri Dec 23 19:35:33 2005] : <B>(3) Rien</B>: <font color='#004040'>Rien shrugs and crouches down again</font><br>
[Fri Dec 23 19:35:36 2005] : <B>(2) Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>If anyone is watching, they would hardly know he had gone. "Fine. Go. I'll be behind you."</font><br>
[Fri Dec 23 19:35:37 2005] : <B>(1) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>"Done," Mia says, lowering the hood back into position.</font><br>

[Fri Dec 23 22:19:39 2005] : <B>(2) Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>some things are left to play out</font><br>
[Fri Dec 23 22:19:47 2005] : <B>(1) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>Er, not that I want to get into that discussion.</font><br>
[Fri Dec 23 22:19:51 2005] : <B>(7) Rien</B>: <font color='#004040'>Rien doesn't have horses, just an Ilium license to ride one through the town</font><br>
[Fri Dec 23 22:20:06 2005] : <B>(1) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>Maybe Artagus will, of course.</font><br>
[Fri Dec 23 22:20:26 2005] : <B>(2) Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>Renate's just happy that Mia acted from her own will, and died free.</font><br>
[Fri Dec 23 22:21:08 2005] : <B>(2) Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>And whatever funeral arrangements are proper, Renate will be honored to make.</font><br>
[Fri Dec 23 22:21:30 2005] : <B>(2) Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>(Assuming that Artagus doesn't see fit to send her soul back.)</font><br>
[Fri Dec 23 22:21:54 2005] : <B>(1) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>Well, if he does, let's hope he gives some warning.</font><br>
[Fri Dec 23 22:22:09 2005] : <B>(2) Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>yeah, not so much with the Buffy season 6 here.</font><br>
[Fri Dec 23 22:22:46 2005] : <B>(7) Rien</B>: <font color='#004040'>Pardon?</font><br>
[Fri Dec 23 22:23:04 2005] : <B>(2) Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>When Buffy was resurrected, she had to claw her way out of her own grave. Not pretty.</font><br>
[Fri Dec 23 22:23:29 2005] : <B>(2) Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>Heavily ironic, though.</font><br>
[Fri Dec 23 22:23:36 2005] : <B>(1) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>Well, she presumably had picked up a few pointers... right.</font><br>
[Fri Dec 23 22:23:56 2005] : <B>(1) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>I only watched up through season 4, I'm afraid.</font><br>
[Fri Dec 23 22:24:16 2005] : <B>(1) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>I could tell it was going sort of downhill after 3, so I decided not to plow through 5.</font><br>
[Fri Dec 23 22:24:32 2005] : <B>(2) Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>5 would have been awesome if they'd picked a better actress to play Glory.</font><br>
[Fri Dec 23 22:24:39 2005] : <B>(1) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>I really liked Angel, though. It became a more solid and stable series.</font><br>
[Fri Dec 23 22:24:49 2005] : <B>(2) Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>She was drop-dead gorgeous, which is why they picked her no doubt, but she couldn't sell the role.</font><br>
[Fri Dec 23 22:25:06 2005] : <B>(2) Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>Petulant rather than ironical.</font><br>
[Fri Dec 23 22:26:26 2005] : <B>(2) Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>As though they'd picked a barnstormer to play the Mayor, instead of the nice laid-back folksy guy they got.</font><br>
[Fri Dec 23 22:26:45 2005] : <B>(2) Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>(Who was bloody perfect. Best bit of casting in the entire series, you ask me.)</font><br>
[Fri Dec 23 22:27:32 2005] : <B>(2) Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>Anyway, I hope Mia could at least witness what the group said and did for her.</font><br>
[Fri Dec 23 22:27:33 2005] : <B>(1) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>One of the best actors, too.</font><br>
[Fri Dec 23 22:27:38 2005] : <B>(1) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>Completely sold the relationship with Faith.</font><br>
[Fri Dec 23 22:27:42 2005] : <B>(2) Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>yep</font><br>
[Fri Dec 23 22:28:08 2005] : <B>(1) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>Given Eliza Dushku's total hotness, it was a difficult and winding road to avoid all sexual subtext.</font><br>
[Fri Dec 23 22:28:11 2005] : <B>(1) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>And dammit, he did it.</font><br>
[Fri Dec 23 22:28:15 2005] : <B>(7) Rien</B>: <font color='#004040'>Oh lovely, so arrives my brother-in-law</font><br>
[Fri Dec 23 22:28:26 2005] : <B>(2) Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>well, go on, then, and may the visit go smoothly</font><br>
[Fri Dec 23 22:28:40 2005] : <B>(1) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>I'm gonna relax a bit. Got a slight headache myself.</font><br>
[Fri Dec 23 22:28:45 2005] : <B>(1) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>Nothing like a migraine, thank goodness.</font><br>
[Fri Dec 23 22:28:47 2005] : <B>(2) Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>'k</font><br>
[Fri Dec 23 22:28:51 2005] : <B>(7) Rien</B>: <font color='#004040'>nah, he's visiting with my parents just now, so I'm staying here for a while</font><br>
[Fri Dec 23 22:29:04 2005] : <B>(2) Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>when you see me online, stop me and we'll do a bit of side-questin'</font><br>
[Fri Dec 23 22:30:35 2005] : <B>(2) Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>because I'm damn, damn curious to know what her family is thinking right about now</font><br>
[Fri Dec 23 22:30:58 2005] : <B>(2) Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>and I'm glad that she'll go back to them feeling basically good about things, instead of the wreck she's been lately</font><br>
[Fri Dec 23 22:31:26 2005] : <B>(2) Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>she fought hard for a human soul, and by gosh she won</font><br>
[Fri Dec 23 22:31:50 2005] : <B>(1) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>Yes indeed. Took some work, too.</font><br>
[Fri Dec 23 22:31:55 2005] : <B>(1) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>Against various distractions.</font><br>
[Fri Dec 23 22:32:17 2005] : <B>(2) Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>Well, and if she's set a few interesting chains of events in motion, that's not a bad thing either. ;)</font><br>
[Fri Dec 23 22:32:48 2005] : <B>(1) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>For now, good night.</font><br>
[Fri Dec 23 22:32:52 2005] : <B>(2) Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>Especially given what she thinks her duty is, which is something Rien and Aryk will find out about in due course.</font><br>
