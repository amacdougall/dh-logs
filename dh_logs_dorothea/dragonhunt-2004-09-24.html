[Fri Sep 24 17:50:25 2004] : <B>Rien</B>: <font color='#004040'>oh, alan, for dramatic effect I'm considering have Rien gain enough control to mouth the words "help....me..." or something when DE isn't using his mouth</font><br>
[Fri Sep 24 17:51:47 2004] : <B>Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>Fair enough; I'll give away a little bit, and you can decide how to play it.</font><br>
[Fri Sep 24 17:52:20 2004] : <B>Rien</B>: <font color='#004040'>if you want ot make it easier for the average reader in the logs you cna pass me the words and actions over IM and I'll put them up, that way Rien's name is tacked to the from of them</font><br>
[Fri Sep 24 17:52:24 2004] : <B>Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>Rien's current actions are programmed: given the stimulus (Heartbreaker), he immediately uses his full, usually-hidden powers to achieve the goal of destroying him.</font><br>
[Fri Sep 24 17:53:38 2004] : <B>Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>Well, it would be better if I had a way of giving you normal control over your actions, with just a fuller palette of moves, but I didn't get around to writing up descriptions of his bigger moves.</font><br>
[Fri Sep 24 17:53:58 2004] : <B>Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>And I don't want to deal with actual numbers in this clash-of-the-titans scenario.</font><br>
[Fri Sep 24 17:54:15 2004] : <B>Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>That's too similar to the DM who lovingly rolls every die of a 100d10 divine-avatar duel.</font><br>
[Fri Sep 24 17:54:26 2004] : <B>Dorothea</B>: <font color='#000080'>no, because the conclusion is pretty much foregone</font><br>
[Fri Sep 24 17:54:28 2004] : <B>Rien</B>: <font color='#004040'>yes, it is</font><br>
[Fri Sep 24 17:55:00 2004] : <B>Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>So for the moment, I'm going to just narrate Rien/Trancey/Eternal's actions; it's up to you how much volition -- or even consciousness -- "normal" Rien has.</font><br>
[Fri Sep 24 17:55:17 2004] : <B>Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>Maybe he doesn't remember it at all; maybe it feels like he's intentionally doing everything, and he doesn't know why.</font><br>
[Fri Sep 24 17:55:41 2004] : <B>Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>Maybe it's as you said originally, and he's being controlled only physically.</font><br>
[Fri Sep 24 17:57:05 2004] : <B>Rien</B>: <font color='#004040'>It meshes better with his experience with living a dual lfe that he knows that he's under someone else's control and manages to overcome it enough to say something or do something small</font><br>
[Fri Sep 24 17:57:17 2004] : <B>Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>That's entirely reasonable.</font><br>
[Fri Sep 24 17:57:39 2004] : <B>Rien</B>: <font color='#004040'>like he's trapped inside his head, able to see, hear, touch, taste nad smell, but with absolutely no control unless he manages ot push his way past the chains holding him down</font><br>
[Fri Sep 24 17:59:26 2004] : <B>Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>Well, you'll have a few rounds of steadily decreasing power after the programmed goal is fulfilled.</font><br>
[Fri Sep 24 17:59:34 2004] : <B>Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>I suggest you use it to drive Keph away.</font><br>

[Fri Sep 24 18:01:17 2004] : <B>Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>They can be pertinent to the Dragonhunt world, or more general (not OOC, of course).</font><br>
[Fri Sep 24 18:01:27 2004] : <B>Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>The gap between chapters 5 and 6.</font><br>
[Fri Sep 24 18:01:42 2004] : <B>Rien</B>: <font color='#004040'>so, today in other words</font><br>
[Fri Sep 24 18:01:53 2004] : <B>Dorothea</B>: <font color='#000080'>can you give us a sample of what topics would be in a real-world freestyle contest?</font><br>
[Fri Sep 24 18:02:01 2004] : <B>Dorothea</B>: <font color='#000080'>(so that we actually give you something you can use)</font><br>
[Fri Sep 24 18:02:06 2004] : <B>Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>No, this is the denouement of chapter 5, with a little explanation of what the devil Chapter 6 is about.</font><br>
[Fri Sep 24 18:02:18 2004] : <B>Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>The interludes will happen before Chapter 6 hits.</font><br>
[Fri Sep 24 18:02:52 2004] : <B>Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>In a real-world contest, you'd see a hat or jar full of scraps of paper with simple words or phrases on them -- not necessarily topics, just things that can be worked into lyrics.</font><br>
[Fri Sep 24 18:03:25 2004] : <B>Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>Like "empty" or "this is not a test" or "my favorite weapon" or something.</font><br>
[Fri Sep 24 18:03:37 2004] : <B>Dorothea</B>: <font color='#000080'>okay... so I can just go back and read through logs and find catchphrases?</font><br>
[Fri Sep 24 18:03:40 2004] : <B>Dorothea</B>: <font color='#000080'>this can be done</font><br>
[Fri Sep 24 18:03:45 2004] : <B>Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>Just enough of a "topic" that if you recite something you've previously memorized, it'll be obvious it doesn't have much to do with the topic.</font><br>
[Fri Sep 24 18:03:48 2004] : <B>Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>Make sense?</font><br>
[Fri Sep 24 18:03:48 2004] : <B>Rien</B>: <font color='#004040'>hmmm...I've got the perfect one that we could work Rien into a surprise entrant with</font><br>
[Fri Sep 24 18:03:55 2004] : <B>Rien</B>: <font color='#004040'>heh</font><br>
[Fri Sep 24 18:04:00 2004] : <B>Rien</B>: <font color='#004040'>yep</font><br>
[Fri Sep 24 18:04:01 2004] : <B>Dorothea</B>: <font color='#000080'>yep</font><br>
[Fri Sep 24 18:04:07 2004] : <B>Rien</B>: <font color='#004040'>I believe we can do this with some semblance of ease</font><br>
[Fri Sep 24 18:04:46 2004] : <B>Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>Many freestylists have snippets or couplets they can fall back on, but that's like when a figure skater does a double tow loop instead of a triple.</font><br>
[Fri Sep 24 18:04:48 2004] : <B>Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>Judges notice even that.</font><br>
[Fri Sep 24 18:05:34 2004] : <B>Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>Anyway, having gotten better at true on-the-mike real-time freestyling later, I can say that you don't really even have time to do that fallback.</font><br>
[Fri Sep 24 18:05:40 2004] : <B>Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>Either you're on or you're not.</font><br>
[Fri Sep 24 18:05:48 2004] : <B>Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>In our typed competition, it'll be much easier.</font><br>
[Fri Sep 24 18:06:13 2004] : <B>Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>(And emulating different rap styles for each competitor will handicap me sufficiently.)</font><br>
[Fri Sep 24 18:07:10 2004] : <B>Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>Anyway, 20 topics. Each competitor will roll 1d20 when he comes up.</font><br>
[Fri Sep 24 18:07:12 2004] : <B>Dorothea</B>: <font color='#000080'>oh, I think Matt can stand up to you</font><br>
[Fri Sep 24 18:07:24 2004] : <B>Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>(Or 1d19, or so on, as topics are used up.)</font><br>
[Fri Sep 24 18:07:35 2004] : <B>Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>(OpenRPG doesn't care what the random number range is.)</font><br>
[Fri Sep 24 18:08:06 2004] : <B>Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>Well, don't get partial, since I'm also going to use you two as judges.</font><br>
[Fri Sep 24 18:08:18 2004] : <B>Dorothea</B>: <font color='#000080'>yeah, a 19-sided die would be a very weird sort of thing</font><br>
[Fri Sep 24 18:08:19 2004] : <B>Rien</B>: <font color='#004040'>great, how do you get it to have 0 as a valid rolled number?</font><br>
[Fri Sep 24 18:08:28 2004] : <B>Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>I'll be throwing the first couple of rounds to Matt, for story purposes.</font><br>
[Fri Sep 24 18:08:41 2004] : <B>Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>You don't. It's for dice, not programs.</font><br>
[Fri Sep 24 18:08:46 2004] : <B>Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>Just roll one extra and subtract.</font><br>
[Fri Sep 24 18:08:53 2004] : <B>Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>[1d6-1] -> [6,-1] = (5) for 0-5.</font><br>
[Fri Sep 24 18:08:58 2004] : <B>Rien</B>: <font color='#004040'>well, there are dice with a 0 on them</font><br>
[Fri Sep 24 18:09:00 2004] : <B>Dorothea</B>: <font color='#000080'>lord, I wouldn't know how to judge a rap contest!</font><br>
[Fri Sep 24 18:09:16 2004] : <B>Rien</B>: <font color='#004040'>Ars magica 10-sided dice for example</font><br>
[Fri Sep 24 18:09:19 2004] : <B>Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>Just pick which one you like better, but toss in some objective measures of rhyme and meter.</font><br>
[Fri Sep 24 18:09:30 2004] : <B>Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>If the scan is all off, you can assume it wouldn't work with the beat.</font><br>
[Fri Sep 24 18:09:54 2004] : <B>Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>Of course, the "say it out loud" test doesn't work if you don't listen to enough rap to coerce the words into a rap diction.</font><br>
[Fri Sep 24 18:10:09 2004] : <B>Rien</B>: <font color='#004040'>thankfully I do</font><br>
[Fri Sep 24 18:10:54 2004] : <B>Dorothea</B>: <font color='#000080'>well, so you're only stuck with ONE totally incompetent judge, Alan :)</font><br>
[Fri Sep 24 18:11:01 2004] : <B>Rien</B>: <font color='#004040'>pffft</font><br>
[Fri Sep 24 18:11:06 2004] : <B>Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>I could assign you some homework. :)</font><br>

[Fri Sep 24 18:11:40 2004] : <B>Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>Or, honestly, listening to that one Kid Cutup mix would pretty much do it. I'm listening to it yet again right now.</font><br>
[Fri Sep 24 18:11:44 2004] : <B>Rien</B>: <font color='#004040'>you know enough about rhythm to know what you your're going ot be able to put to a track that has a regular beat</font><br>
[Fri Sep 24 18:12:01 2004] : <B>Dorothea</B>: <font color='#000080'>well, yes, you can't get out of a comparative literature program without SOME training in prosody</font><br>
[Fri Sep 24 18:13:17 2004] : <B>Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>Well, there you go.</font><br>
[Fri Sep 24 18:13:29 2004] : <B>Dorothea</B>: <font color='#000080'>... just not very much, is all.</font><br>
[Fri Sep 24 18:13:54 2004] : <B>Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>Just decide if the lyrics are interesting in a subjective sense, whether they're clever (cleverness is big in rap), and whether they have rhyme and rhythm.</font><br>
[Fri Sep 24 18:14:08 2004] : <B>Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>The more powerful the rhythm, the better.</font><br>
[Fri Sep 24 18:14:28 2004] : <B>Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>Take, as an example, a single line from the RZA (mastermind of the Wu-Tang Clan): "Bust to jump up and snuff out the judge."</font><br>
[Fri Sep 24 18:14:38 2004] : <B>Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>Don't worry about what it rhymes with or where it's going -- just say it aloud.</font><br>
[Fri Sep 24 18:14:44 2004] : <B>Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>It's inherently incredibly rhythmic.</font><br>
[Fri Sep 24 18:15:06 2004] : <B>Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>Assonance, even without rhyme, is very powerful in rap.</font><br>
