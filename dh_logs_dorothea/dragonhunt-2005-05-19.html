[Thu May 19 17:57:47 2005] : <B>Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>Got some water boiling.</font><br>
[Thu May 19 17:58:18 2005] : <B>Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>And as far as I can tell, I'm not at any sort of dangerous addiction level with coffee. Four cups a day, total, is about the size of it.</font><br>
[Thu May 19 17:58:28 2005] : <B>Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>Hey, wasn't accusing.</font><br>
[Thu May 19 17:58:44 2005] : <B>Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>No, no, I was just thinking about it.</font><br>
[Thu May 19 17:59:25 2005] : <B>Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>So under what pretense did you get the interview with Mekoides?</font><br>
[Thu May 19 17:59:49 2005] : <B>Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>Haven't, yet.</font><br>
[Thu May 19 17:59:50 2005] : <B>Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>Or rather, how did you present yourself to his people?</font><br>
[Thu May 19 18:00:02 2005] : <B>Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>I believe we were going to try to go through Coris's mole.</font><br>
[Thu May 19 18:00:16 2005] : <B>Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>Or at least get some advice from him.</font><br>
[Thu May 19 18:01:19 2005] : <B>Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>Otherwise, the most sensible thing would seem to be "one Silver Coast patriot to another -- let's talk, no strings."</font><br>
[Thu May 19 18:01:36 2005] : <B>Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>She fully expects them to call her a dirty sellout at first; that's fine, as long as they'll talk.</font><br>
[Thu May 19 18:01:59 2005] : <B>Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>Coris wouldn't have his person reveal himself in any way.</font><br>
[Thu May 19 18:02:21 2005] : <B>Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>Smart. :)</font><br>
[Thu May 19 18:02:21 2005] : <B>Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>For one thing, Coris says the guy provides intelligence in more circles than just the Knights.</font><br>
[Thu May 19 18:02:54 2005] : <B>Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>Okay. Then we'll have to go through the front door. One way might be to talk to Mekoides's cousin in the police force.</font><br>
[Thu May 19 18:02:57 2005] : <B>Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>The Knights of Destiny do have open meetings, though, hosted by their PR branch. Anyone can walk into their office.</font><br>
[Thu May 19 18:03:15 2005] : <B>Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>Okay, that works too. :) But talking to the police is still a good idea because of the vamp issue.</font><br>
[Thu May 19 18:03:44 2005] : <B>Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>Incidentally, where are Gravin and Lehron from?</font><br>
[Thu May 19 18:04:22 2005] : <B>Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>They're both from the Patchwork Kingdoms.</font><br>
[Thu May 19 18:04:46 2005] : <B>Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>Sorel's more of a citizen of the world type... he doesn't consider himself "from" anywhere except a generic "wilderness."</font><br>
[Thu May 19 18:04:50 2005] : <B>Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>Which may well be a front.</font><br>
[Thu May 19 18:04:57 2005] : <B>Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>Masan Ahim never says anything.</font><br>
[Thu May 19 18:05:02 2005] : <B>Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>Well, but Sorel's admitted he was born in Ilium. :)</font><br>
[Thu May 19 18:06:09 2005] : <B>Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>All right, then, the plan is to try to talk to the police, and then to go to an open session if the police contact doesn't result in a closed one.</font><br>
[Thu May 19 18:06:25 2005] : <B>Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>Renate isn't going anywhere alone, though; that'd be extremely unwise.</font><br>
[Thu May 19 18:06:42 2005] : <B>Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>Hm, see if the police can arrange for you to talk to Mekoides?</font><br>
[Thu May 19 18:06:58 2005] : <B>Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>Exactly. Since they're wink-wink-nudge-nudge connected.</font><br>
[Thu May 19 18:08:08 2005] : <B>Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>Hm. That's a pretty good possibility, then.</font><br>
[Thu May 19 18:08:23 2005] : <B>Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>She'd prefer to have Gravin along, I think, with Sorel second on the list and Lehron third -- but if they're all busy, she'll take any of Coris's men as long as they were born in the Silver Coast or the Patchworks.</font><br>
[Thu May 19 18:09:02 2005] : <B>Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>And can hold their tongues, of course.</font><br>
[Thu May 19 18:09:28 2005] : <B>Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>I should warn you ahead of time that Sol&aacute;n is on his way, too. The Atlantis force was all too happy to give him a special dispensation to get out of their hair.</font><br>
[Thu May 19 18:09:53 2005] : <B>Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>oh, lord...</font><br>
[Thu May 19 18:09:55 2005] : <B>Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>*EYEROLL*</font><br>
[Thu May 19 18:10:13 2005] : <B>Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>well, we'll deal as we have to with him</font><br>
[Thu May 19 18:10:22 2005] : <B>Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>and we'll certainly warn the police! professional courtesy</font><br>
[Thu May 19 18:10:53 2005] : <font color='#008000'>** Renate ponders wild goose chases it might be possible to send Sol&aacute;n on... **</font><br>
[Thu May 19 18:11:03 2005] : <B>Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>Anyway, let me fire up the log. Where do you plan to start?</font><br>
[Thu May 19 18:11:13 2005] : <B>Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>wherever you wish</font><br>
[Thu May 19 18:11:52 2005] : <B>Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>Are you going to be making it clear that you're with the Purgatory tour?</font><br>
[Thu May 19 18:11:57 2005] : <B>Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>(I assume Coris understands why he isn't being invited on this little jaunt. But if not, she'll be happy to explain it.)</font><br>
[Thu May 19 18:11:59 2005] : <B>Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>Because that would get you to different places.</font><br>
[Thu May 19 18:12:03 2005] : <B>Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>Sure. Doing otherwise would be dishonest.</font><br>
[Thu May 19 18:12:21 2005] : <B>Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>But she will accompany that with a wink and a "Keep your friends close... and your enemies closer."</font><br>
[Thu May 19 18:12:44 2005] : <B>Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>Besides, it's past reason that they didn't see her with Darm.</font><br>
[Thu May 19 18:13:06 2005] : <B>Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>In that case, we can start with the chief's office. He's entirely ready to get a few things straight.</font><br>
[Thu May 19 18:14:00 2005] : <B>Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>Log is on.</font><br>
[Thu May 19 18:14:52 2005] : <B>Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>"So, Lady Renate. I pulled up your file, I hope you forgive the intrusion, and I see that you're <i>damn</i> qualified to keep order."</font><br>
[Thu May 19 18:15:11 2005] : <B>Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>"Due diligence; I quite understand. And thank you."</font><br>
[Thu May 19 18:15:59 2005] : <B>Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>Drak Lanivarin is a well-fed man with a bushy moustache and beard, and deep-set blue eyes. His office is cluttered with stacks of papers and empty carryout containers.</font><br>
[Thu May 19 18:16:25 2005] : <B>Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>"I wanted first to touch base with you about this vampire business. I assume you've read the papers."</font><br>
[Thu May 19 18:17:06 2005] : <B>Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>"Yes, and I've recruited agents from the Order of Malvern to join our beat cops for two nights before and after the concert."</font><br>
[Thu May 19 18:17:34 2005] : <B>Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>"Our killer sounds crafty, but I hope they can be a deterrent."</font><br>
[Thu May 19 18:18:22 2005] : <B>Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>"Our killer is definitely crafty. Unofficially, our top suspect is Earl Markwith of Eldorado -- if any of your people see him, I'd tell them to stake first and ask questions later."</font><br>
[Thu May 19 18:19:13 2005] : <B>Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>"That's definitely our plan, anyway. And whatever you can do to suggest that citizens not go around alone would be good. I understand you have your own places to circulate that message."</font><br>
[Thu May 19 18:19:42 2005] : <B>Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>"Unfortunately, we've got this pesky oath to allow due process even to vampires... but I'll spread the word. Apprehend with caution."</font><br>
[Thu May 19 18:20:33 2005] : <B>Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>"That will be fine. If we run into a situation we can't wait for due process to solve, we'll take whatever lumps we've got coming."</font><br>
[Thu May 19 18:20:45 2005] : <B>Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>"Though I hope that article will draw most of the unpleasantness toward me."</font><br>
[Thu May 19 18:21:23 2005] : <B>Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>"We have no idea there's a concert going on, and we certain have no idea it's Purgatory, and the idea that the vampire murderer of Eldorado and Atlantis might be following you for some reason..."</font><br>
[Thu May 19 18:21:35 2005] : <B>Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>"So naturally we don't have any plausible reason to be at the concert grounds in force."</font><br>
[Thu May 19 18:21:58 2005] : <B>Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>"Between you and your... other assistants... I think the venue will be well-defended."</font><br>
[Thu May 19 18:22:18 2005] : <B>Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>"Well, speaking of that... do you mind if I close the door?"</font><br>
[Thu May 19 18:22:35 2005] : <B>Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>Lanivarin brushes absently at his beard. "Go ahead."</font><br>
[Thu May 19 18:22:53 2005] : <B>Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>He pulls blinds, cutting off view into his office.</font><br>
[Thu May 19 18:23:55 2005] : <B>Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>She shuts the office door without slamming it. "I've got a problem, and I'm hoping you can help me solve it. Darm Sobreda&ntilde;o is -- well, he's trying to push what I think is a foolhardy agenda. As yet, though, I don't have a good counter for it."</font><br>
[Thu May 19 18:24:35 2005] : <B>Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>"In a larger sense, I would agree that he is. But that isn't what you're talking about, is it?"</font><br>
[Thu May 19 18:24:58 2005] : <B>Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>She chuckles. "No, not really; I'm talking small, at the moment."</font><br>
[Thu May 19 18:25:44 2005] : <B>Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>"Darm's worried about your local patriots. Something about a pig and a misspelling. What he wants to do is make them overreach, so that there's no choice but to bust them."</font><br>
[Thu May 19 18:26:01 2005] : <B>Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>"I don't like that idea one bit, myself."</font><br>
[Thu May 19 18:27:15 2005] : <B>Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>"Anything that brings discord to the city is to be avoided," the police chief agrees, not without a sanctimonious air.</font><br>
[Thu May 19 18:28:25 2005] : <B>Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>"I quite agree," she answers. "Now, I have an idea that'll discard the discord while still allowing free citizens to make their opinions absolutely crystal-clear... but I don't have entree to the right people to carry it out."</font><br>
[Thu May 19 18:28:42 2005] : <B>Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>"Which is where I was hoping you might help."</font><br>
[Thu May 19 18:29:24 2005] : <B>Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>"I could always carry your suggestions to the city government, as the words of a 'concerned citizen'..."</font><br>
[Thu May 19 18:30:24 2005] : <B>Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>"The city government isn't the organization I meant," she says quietly, with a meaningful look. "Sometimes when things have to get done, it's the black sheep I turn to." Perhaps the words "black sheep" were capitalized; perhaps not.</font><br>
[Thu May 19 18:31:07 2005] : <B>Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>"I should warn you... in this town, if you turn to the wrong people at the wrong time, you could get three bags full of trouble."</font><br>
[Thu May 19 18:31:31 2005] : <B>Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>"As I tell a lot of people who bring issues to this desk... the channels are there for a reason."</font><br>
[Thu May 19 18:31:57 2005] : <B>Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>"I consider myself duly warned. Whatever happens, I won't come crying to you. Fair?"</font><br>
[Thu May 19 18:32:45 2005] : <B>Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>"Entirely."</font><br>
[Thu May 19 18:33:39 2005] : <B>Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>"So it sounds like you want the help of the Knights of Destiny. Not the most well-balanced sword on the rack, but a sharp one."</font><br>
[Thu May 19 18:33:55 2005] : <B>Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>"Quite right. They've got the numbers I need. I'm just hoping they've got the discipline."</font><br>
[Thu May 19 18:34:57 2005] : <B>Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>"What I've got in mind is a bit outside the box -- but if it works, it'll be epic."</font><br>
[Thu May 19 18:36:12 2005] : <B>Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>"Not to mention completely legal and thoroughly ethical." Now she's grinning outright.</font><br>
[Thu May 19 18:36:17 2005] : <B>Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>"How far outside the box? They have a fairly small box, but oddly enough that often means it's harder to get people outside it."</font><br>
[Thu May 19 18:36:47 2005] : <B>Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>He doesn't sound especially sympathetic to them, obviously. From the rumors, you might have been expecting more of a panderer.</font><br>
[Thu May 19 18:37:44 2005] : <B>Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>"Well... in aim, it's right up their alley; they've already proven that. It's the methods that are... somewhat unorthodox, and perhaps for them a bit difficult. But the payoff is worth it, and I think they'll understand the reasoning once it's explained to them."</font><br>

[Thu May 19 18:39:47 2005] : <B>Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>She hooks one arm over the back of her chair.

[Thu May 19 18:41:20 2005] : <B>Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>"Well, here. They came by here to hand out their latest flyer. I took one, to be polite."</font><br>

[Thu May 19 18:55:31 2005] : <B>Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>This "headquarters" of the Knights of Destiny is really just the basement of a long building which houses a pawn shop, a laundry, and a corner grocery.</font><br>

[Thu May 19 19:01:37 2005] : <B>Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>A pretty broad base of people is represented here, most clearly tradesmen and what in Karlbotel would be peasants; the people with the most to gain from the collapse of the current system.</font><br>

[Thu May 19 19:02:11 2005] : <B>Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>It's clear why Eridu is the home of this movement. Not only dragon planning, but the collaboration of an entire economic system, has exploited these people.</font><br>

[Thu May 19 19:03:20 2005] : <B>Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>There's no immediately obvious leader, but a quarter-hour's observation of the crowd turns up several people who seem to be the most well-connected.</font><br>
[Thu May 19 19:04:09 2005] : <B>Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>Gravin whirls by, being tugged along by a pretty girl in the direction of the band, and slams straight into Lehron.</font><br>

[Thu May 19 19:07:18 2005] : <B>Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>The bald man in the black shirt wears a red sash instead of an armband. You've noticed an increasing knot of people gathering around him; apparently a conversation turned into a lecture that's drawing attention.</font><br>
[Thu May 19 19:07:44 2005] : <font color='#008000'>** Renate attaches herself and Lehron to the gathering audience, getting as close to the front as she can without undue shoving. **</font><br>

[Thu May 19 19:11:43 2005] : <B>Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>His eyes light on Renate, and doesn't do anything to belie the assumption that he singles her out for being young and female.</font><br>

[Thu May 19 19:13:08 2005] : <B>Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>He's about the same age as Drak Lanivarin, which makes him too old for Renate in the way Coris is&#8212;i.e. old enough to know better, young enough to try.</font><br>

[Thu May 19 19:41:27 2005] : <B>Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>"Good. Now, the reason Purgatory gets listened to isn't so much their music or their message. It's their social force. People think Purgatory's cool because everyone around them says they are, acts like they are, goes to their concerts for some mindless moshing."</font><br>
[Thu May 19 19:41:57 2005] : <B>Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>"Noise. It's all noise."</font><br>

[Thu May 19 19:43:26 2005] : <B>Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>She grins. "So it is. Think you can get a bunch of people in that concert to stand silently? One in ten, you might pull it off.

[Thu May 19 19:44:10 2005] : <B>Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>"And my angle is that I've promised to try to keep the concert free of pranks and violence. So when the Heaven knight stares down at me, I get to stare back and say I kept my word and what's his problem?"</font><br>
[Thu May 19 19:44:30 2005] : <B>Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>"Interesting.... very interesting. In fact, that's a work of genius."</font><br>
[Thu May 19 19:45:00 2005] : <B>Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>"People would be going there for fun... if they're going to go there and not yell, we'd have to motivate them with 'fun' of a sort."</font><br>

[Thu May 19 19:47:18 2005] : <B>Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>"Well... slow down a moment. You might want to limit this to the smallest number that can possibly work. Because, you see, the counter is for Purgatory to try to annoy your people intentionally."</font><br>
[Thu May 19 19:47:45 2005] : <B>Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>"They can't use our security to do it, because we won't have any part of that. Just as well that they're out of their own country; they don't have all that much loyal support."</font><br>
[Thu May 19 19:47:51 2005] : <B>Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>"But they do have some roadies and groupies."</font><br>

[Thu May 19 19:50:14 2005] : <B>Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>"Anyway, fifth-quarter, I've got my friend Aryk. He's pretty fly, and he's got a damn fine lightwarrior with him.

[Thu May 19 19:50:24 2005] : <B>Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>"Which means we have to get every random person on the street to know about it. Word of mouth is the greatest weapon."</font><br>
[Thu May 19 19:51:53 2005] : <B>Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>She shakes her head. "Excuse me for talking numbers, but we need a hundred to two-hundred-fifty people. You've got a hundred or so.

[Thu May 19 19:52:47 2005] : <B>Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>"Remember what I said about discipline. It's not easy to stand still when nobody around you is."</font><br>

[Thu May 19 19:53:09 2005] : <B>Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>"Right. Right. Discipline."</font><br>
[Thu May 19 19:53:49 2005] : <B>Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>"It's not wrong if it advances the goal. The goal is sending Purgatory home with its tail between its legs. And maybe getting some stupid kids at that concert to wise up and listen to how pernicious their message is."</font><br>
