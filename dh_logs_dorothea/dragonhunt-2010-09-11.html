[Sat Sep 11 18:51:37 2010] : <b>(2320) Rien</b>: <font color='#263607'>So, if Rien can't dispell it directly because he isn't at its source, can he find its source?</font><br />
[Sat Sep 11 18:51:39 2010] : <b>(2317) Alan</b>: <font color='#3d0079'>Rien is too far away to directly see the structure of the spell, but his education and experience tell him that the darkness is a sphere extending from the necromancer.

[Sat Sep 11 18:53:31 2010] : <b>(2317) Alan</b>: <font color='#3d0079'>I guess we haven't ironed out precisely how Rien's magical vision works, but it's safe to say it's not linked to his physical vision. I don't know if it has falloff with range, or whether it works within what would normally be his line of sight. Hm... I think in the past, we've said that in the Mirror Realm, he can see magic much more clearly, right?</font><br />
[Sat Sep 11 18:54:00 2010] : <b>(2318) Aryk</b>: <font color='#800000'>That makes sense.</font><br />

[Sat Sep 11 18:54:54 2010] : <b>(2317) Alan</b>: <font color='#3d0079'>So I'm going to say if Rien were in the Mirror Realm, he'd still be physically covered in darkness (since magical effects also happen in the Mirror Realm), but he could see the spell effect as long as its within line of sight...</font><br />
[Sat Sep 11 18:55:13 2010] : <b>(2317) Alan</b>: <font color='#3d0079'>...whereas in the physical world, he has to be closer in order to detect the magic, which is how we've normally worked it.</font><br />

Rien can't make out the exact structure of the spell, but he can tell that it's necromantic in nature -- or at least, it uses arcane magic to generate negative energy -- and uses the staff as a focus for persistence, so the user doesn't have to concentrate on it.</font><br />

But he can also see the hints of magic which summoned and bind the phantom steed; seven or eight defensive spells on the necromancer, mostly energy-deadening or energy-absorbing magic that is necromantic in basis; and the faint magical glow of a few potions and artifacts in his possession, no brighter than the afterimage left on a stage when the lights go down.</font><br />

[Sat Sep 11 21:33:10 2010] : <b>(2317) Alan</b>: <font color='#3d0079'>I understand Perl, it's just really really weird syntax.</font><br />

[Sat Sep 11 21:36:43 2010] : <b>(2317) Alan</b>: <font color='#3d0079'>I guess you use what you gotta use. Perl is powerful and effective. Looking weird and acting a bit funky is not that big a drawback.</font><br />

[Sat Sep 11 21:45:53 2010] : <b>(2320) Rien</b>: <font color='#263607'>Still a third of a game.</font><br />
[Sat Sep 11 21:46:04 2010] : <b>(2317) Alan</b>: <font color='#3d0079'>Would you pay $300 for one triple-length game?</font><br />
[Sat Sep 11 21:46:38 2010] : <b>(2320) Rien</b>: <font color='#263607'>Nope, but once all three parts are out they'll inevitably bring out an edition with all three of them in it for much less than the total price of the individual sets.</font><br />
[Sat Sep 11 21:47:08 2010] : <b>(2317) Alan</b>: <font color='#3d0079'>Okay, that's a reasonable approach, and one that doesn't boil down to saying "Fellowship of the Ring? Nonsense, I won't pay $15 for a third of a novel!"</font><br />
[Sat Sep 11 21:48:10 2010] : <b>(2317) Alan</b>: <font color='#3d0079'>I like Starcraft more for all the fan-made custom maps, like little RPGs, and weird minigame things. Those really make the game pay for itself, in my opinion.</font><br />
[Sat Sep 11 21:48:44 2010] : <b>(2317) Alan</b>: <font color='#3d0079'>Starcraft and Warcraft 3 brought the Tower Defense concept into the mainstream, and Warcraft 3 was the basis for an entirely new type of game with DOTA.</font><br />
