[Tue Feb 01 18:11:05 2005] : <B>Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>"The best I can tell you is that with Karlbotel's political situation what it is at present, there aren't wedding bells in my immediate future."</font><br>
[Tue Feb 01 18:12:00 2005] : <B>Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>Coris frowns. "It still doesn't necessarily fit with my lifelong obsession with exclusivity, but I'm sure I could buy a peerage somewhere if necessary."</font><br>

[Tue Feb 01 18:14:25 2005] : <B>Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>"Because if it does turn out to be me, it's mildly easier not to have to work out inheritance and rulership issues. If you're a straight commoner, I don't have to."</font><br>
[Tue Feb 01 18:14:47 2005] : <B>Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>"You can't seriously be considering even the faintest possibility of a marriage alliance with Glenworth?"</font><br>
[Tue Feb 01 18:15:44 2005] : <B>Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>"Why not? Honestly, Coris, they call farm-girls naive... who do you <i>think</i> I was born engaged to?" She takes another bite of lamb. "I was half-considering offering it in that tournament -- but then I saw his eyes."</font><br>
[Tue Feb 01 18:16:18 2005] : <B>Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>"I've seen eyes like that before -- on Glitter-dusted gang members in the middle of the night in the Dirty Fifth."</font><br>
[Tue Feb 01 18:16:55 2005] : <B>Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>Coris shakes his head in disbelief. "I know how things work out in the Patchwork Kingdoms... the nobility still fends for itself, liege lords form the only law, blood is thicker than water..."</font><br>
[Tue Feb 01 18:17:12 2005] : <B>Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>"But although it makes me a good living, consider that my living involves killing people."</font><br>
[Tue Feb 01 18:17:47 2005] : <B>Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>"So does mine. Or, at least, what I'm doing at present."</font><br>
[Tue Feb 01 18:18:06 2005] : <B>Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>"If you think I haven't killed, you haven't been keeping up with me very closely."</font><br>

[Tue Feb 01 18:19:41 2005] : <B>Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>"I'm saying that shackling your heart's comfort to a decaying system of power which exists only on dragon sufferance is ... not easily supported by reason."</font><br>
[Tue Feb 01 18:22:08 2005] : <B>Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>"A couple of things about that," she says, unruffled. "The dragons draw lines around our dance-floor, yes -- but we choose the dance, and we dance it. We have for a long time. Sometimes the moves aren't comfortable, you're quite right&#8212;but who among us lives a life of total comfort?"</font><br>
[Tue Feb 01 18:23:19 2005] : <B>Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>"The system in Karlbotel, at least, isn't decaying, because we haven't let it. Glenworth is another story, obviously, but all the more reason for me to have an eye out for my role and my duties."</font><br>
[Tue Feb 01 18:23:59 2005] : <B>Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>"One of which may well be marrying for political advantage. That's how it works. Peace is often bought with the bodies of women; read your history."</font><br>
[Tue Feb 01 18:24:47 2005] : <B>Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>"In the meantime, though&#8212;I'm free. For a while."</font><br>
[Tue Feb 01 18:26:01 2005] : <B>Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>Coris eats in silence for about a minute.</font><br>
[Tue Feb 01 18:26:15 2005] : <B>Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>"Well, if it comes down to it, I could always kill the other guy. I'm in."</font><br>
[Tue Feb 01 18:26:59 2005] : <B>Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>Her face freezes in utter incredulity for a long, long minute, and then a smile spreads across it as slowly as sunrise.</font><br>
[Tue Feb 01 18:27:39 2005] : <B>Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>"I'm glad. I've admired you since you saved me from being chatted up by Karzath Inverness."</font><br>

[Tue Feb 01 18:28:44 2005] : <B>Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>Her eyes are twinkling now, and she's suddenly remembered how to eat.</font><br>

[Tue Feb 01 18:30:44 2005] : <B>Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>Well, it's not that dirty a secret... he's just exploiting his fighting style. Doesn't make him happy.</font><br>
[Tue Feb 01 18:31:04 2005] : <B>Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>But he's come to terms with it, and probably doesn't consider it worth making a big thing out of.</font><br>
[Tue Feb 01 18:31:26 2005] : <B>Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>Okay. Any worries about his people being unhappy with it?</font><br>

[Tue Feb 01 18:32:23 2005] : <B>Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>His people will probably just backslap him.</font><br>
[Tue Feb 01 18:32:27 2005] : <B>Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>Good deal. She's got a room to herself, then.</font><br>
[Tue Feb 01 18:33:17 2005] : <B>Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>Coris might have to be convinced to just go for the gusto; he's got a sense of propriety drawn from epics.</font><br>
