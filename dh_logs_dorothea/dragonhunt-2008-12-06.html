[Sat Dec  6 09:09:54 2008] : <b>(19555) Renate</b>: <font color='#000080'>'lo all!</font><br />
[Sat Dec  6 09:09:58 2008] : <b>(19550) Alan</b>: <font color='#000080'>Playing SSF2T HD with Spivey. It's pretty impressive; it really is just a 100% fan-art remake of the original game. You even get to specify which bugs from the original you keep.</font><br />
[Sat Dec  6 09:10:03 2008] : <b>(19550) Alan</b>: <font color='#000080'>Played, not playing.</font><br />
[Sat Dec  6 09:10:10 2008] : <b>(19552) Aryk</b>: <font color='#710000'>Hey, Adrian!  I thought you were sleeping!</font><br />
[Sat Dec  6 09:10:34 2008] : <b>(19552) Aryk</b>: <font color='#710000'>So it doesn't play any smoother?</font><br />
[Sat Dec  6 09:11:21 2008] : <b>(19554) Rien</b>: <font color='#003300'>Nope, not now.  I happened to wake up, got curious about the time, and noticed my alarm should have gone off a half hour ago</font><br />
[Sat Dec  6 09:12:11 2008] : <b>(19552) Aryk</b>: <font color='#710000'>Sorry about last week, Adrian.</font><br />
[Sat Dec  6 09:12:23 2008] : <b>(19555) Renate</b>: <font color='#000080'>biological Dragonhunt clock! coooool!</font><br />
[Sat Dec  6 09:13:03 2008] : <b>(19550) Alan</b>: <font color='#000080'>You're trained!</font><br />
[Sat Dec  6 09:13:49 2008] : <b>(19554) Rien</b>: <font color='#003300'>Yeah, great, thanks</font><br />
[Sat Dec  6 09:13:52 2008] : <b>(19554) Rien</b>: <font color='#003300'>Don't sweat it, Matt.</font><br />
[Sat Dec  6 09:13:55 2008] : <b>(19550) Alan</b>: <font color='#000080'>Oh, and SSF2T HD has exactly the frame rate (and animation frames, in fact) of the original, because they wanted it to be a pure reproduction. Every aspect of it is the same, gameplay-wise: the animation frames, the hit boxes, everything.</font><br />
[Sat Dec  6 09:14:32 2008] : <b>(19550) Alan</b>: <font color='#000080'>If you want a next-generation Street Fighter with a classic feel and most of the familiar characters, wait for SF4.</font><br />
[Sat Dec  6 09:15:10 2008] : <b>(19550) Alan</b>: <font color='#000080'>Which is really fun, too, and has the original eight characters, plus Akuma, four new characters, and one or two more they're adding for the console versions; only Cammy is confirmed right now.</font><br />
[Sat Dec  6 09:15:40 2008] : <b>(19552) Aryk</b>: <font color='#710000'>Oh, sweet.</font><br />
[Sat Dec  6 09:15:40 2008] : <b>(19550) Alan</b>: <font color='#000080'>(Or come to New York and play it with me.)</font><br />
[Sat Dec  6 09:19:21 2008] : <b>(19550) Alan</b>: <font color='#000080'>Lemme get my notes out. Anything anyone wants to do? There's a fuzzy space of over a week for recovery, demo recording, prayer, research, etc.</font><br />
[Sat Dec  6 09:20:17 2008] : <b>(19552) Aryk</b>: <font color='#710000'>Other than working in time to train with Holmstock.  Aryk's going to be extremely busy that week.</font><br />
[Sat Dec  6 09:20:40 2008] : <b>(19555) Renate</b>: <font color='#000080'>A lot of public relations. Visiting friends. Talking with Sabine. Getting news. Managing money and supplies. Writing letters. The usual, really.</font><br />
[Sat Dec  6 09:21:31 2008] : <b>(19554) Rien</b>: <font color='#003300'>List not coming to mind.  Doing Stuff.</font><br />
[Sat Dec  6 09:21:53 2008] : <b>(19550) Alan</b>: <font color='#000080'>After your last conversation, Sabine headed home to see the parents, visit the neighbors, and perhaps make a show of grounding herself.</font><br />
[Sat Dec  6 09:22:56 2008] : <b>(19555) Renate</b>: <font color='#000080'>If there's time, Renate would follow. Just because home is home, and always will be.</font><br />
[Sat Dec  6 09:25:00 2008] : <b>(19550) Alan</b>: <font color='#000080'>Good idea; Emil goes with, to face the usual ambivalence from all and sundry.</font><br />
[Sat Dec  6 09:25:42 2008] : <b>(19554) Rien</b>: <font color='#003300'>Aren't they all secretly worshipping him or something?</font><br />
[Sat Dec  6 09:26:06 2008] : <b>(19550) Alan</b>: <font color='#000080'>Kind of; but he's also Heaven.</font><br />
[Sat Dec  6 09:26:18 2008] : <b>(19555) Renate</b>: <font color='#000080'>Hmph. Renate will make it PERFECTLY clear that he is her brother and she loves him. And owes him her life, come to that.</font><br />
[Sat Dec  6 09:26:56 2008] : <b>(19555) Renate</b>: <font color='#000080'>And Talks Will Be Had about whether Heaven has any business backing Dark Eternal in a plan to hoodwink half of Northrock that risks immense casualties if anything goes wrong.</font><br />
[Sat Dec  6 09:27:15 2008] : <b>(19550) Alan</b>: <font color='#000080'>Sabine's got a reporter and a photographer following her around; in a moment of privacy, she explains that shaking them off is par for the course for vacationing nobles; which is exactly why she'd just as soon put on overalls and pitch some hay for the camera. A little lesson picked up from Renate.</font><br />
[Sat Dec  6 09:27:32 2008] : <b>(19555) Renate</b>: <font color='#000080'>Indeed. :)</font><br />
[Sat Dec  6 09:28:00 2008] : <b>(19555) Renate</b>: <font color='#000080'>Renate, I daresay, has enough pull by now that she can threaten paparazzi with their careers. Credibly.</font><br />
[Sat Dec  6 09:28:29 2008] : <b>(19555) Renate</b>: <font color='#000080'>The difference, of course, is that Renate would put on overalls and go pitch hay because she wants to be useful.</font><br />
[Sat Dec  6 09:28:43 2008] : <b>(19550) Alan</b>: <font color='#000080'>Emil explains that although as an Arc Knight, he has a lot of freedom, and answers only to Vinn, but that doesn't mean everyone lets him in on their secrets; Arc Knights are outside the chain of command, so they aren't trusted as much by the main Heaven force.</font><br />
[Sat Dec  6 09:28:59 2008] : <b>(19550) Alan</b>: <font color='#000080'>If they're uneasy with Dark Eternal's plans, they aren't letting on.</font><br />
[Sat Dec  6 09:29:21 2008] : <b>(19555) Renate</b>: <font color='#000080'>Fine. Doesn't stop him from expressing his uneasiness to them. She also suggests that he go to Poya Kern.</font><br />
[Sat Dec  6 09:29:32 2008] : <b>(19555) Renate</b>: <font color='#000080'>Speaking of which, how's Daniel?</font><br />
[Sat Dec  6 09:30:26 2008] : <b>(19550) Alan</b>: <font color='#000080'>Formalized, Knight-errant is a mighty weird little role. The archetype comes from earlier times, when a kingdom couldn't really keep fifth sons from kiting off to make something of themselves or die in the process.</font><br />
[Sat Dec  6 09:30:40 2008] : <b>(19550) Alan</b>: <font color='#000080'>They just had to slap a heraldic crest on them and hope they wouldn't disgrace it.</font><br />
[Sat Dec  6 09:31:54 2008] : <b>(19550) Alan</b>: <font color='#000080'>Curious story about Daniel; the old-timers outside the general store are eager to tell the tale.</font><br />
[Sat Dec  6 09:32:46 2008] : <b>(19550) Alan</b>: <font color='#000080'>Seems he and his few remaining mercenaries -- as you recall, most of them went their own way -- were fitting in well enough, doing manual labor and helping drill the small militia.</font><br />
[Sat Dec  6 09:33:36 2008] : <b>(19550) Alan</b>: <font color='#000080'>One of Aaron's "dying" wishes was that the militia be expanded until every able man and woman could be given a role in the worst case, but Karlbotel has been short of armsmen.</font><br />
[Sat Dec  6 09:36:04 2008] : <b>(19550) Alan</b>: <font color='#000080'>Well, it was well known that Flick Tarsley wasn't very content in Karlbotel; he nosed around the town for entertainment and found that girls really did want to wait for marriage, and widows really were hard-working and sturdy and thus not entirely to his refined tastes; and the ale, though fine enough, did not come with company roisterous enough for him.</font><br />
[Sat Dec  6 09:36:37 2008] : <b>(19550) Alan</b>: <font color='#000080'>He made the best of it out of loyalty to Daniel, and never complained; his complaints are inferred, as the old-timers hasten to say. Not in those words.</font><br />
[Sat Dec  6 09:37:23 2008] : <b>(19550) Alan</b>: <font color='#000080'>But when he disappeared one night, it was no surprise to anyone, except perhaps Daniel, who insisted on investigating -- Flick wouldn't leave without saying goodbye.</font><br />
[Sat Dec  6 09:37:59 2008] : <b>(19555) Renate</b>: <font color='#000080'>"And what did he find?" Renate asks, knowing the storytelling forms.</font><br />
[Sat Dec  6 09:38:27 2008] : <b>(19554) Rien</b>: <font color='#003300'>(And it turns out he did say goodbye.  Or at least write it.  In fire.  In a field of fresh wheat.)</font><br />
[Sat Dec  6 09:38:39 2008] : <b>(19550) Alan</b>: <font color='#000080'>And wouldn't you know it, clues turned up: a lock showing the subtlest signs of the pick, a bush bent where it shouldn't be, a farmer reporting shapes on the road that, on reflection, might <i>not</i> have been the mail rider.</font><br />
[Sat Dec  6 09:39:17 2008] : <b>(19550) Alan</b>: <font color='#000080'>Headed roughly north, it seems, on a vector to meet the road to Tempest.</font><br />
[Sat Dec  6 09:39:59 2008] : <b>(19552) Aryk</b>: <font color='#710000'>(Ah, screw 'em.  He was a dick, anyway.)</font><br />
[Sat Dec  6 09:40:12 2008] : <b>(19554) Rien</b>: <font color='#003300'>"Was anyone except Flick missing?"</font><br />
[Sat Dec  6 09:40:13 2008] : <b>(19550) Alan</b>: <font color='#000080'>Daniel rode off to Tempest to see if he could learn anything, but not before asking the same question that has the old-timers beat: "who the heck would want to kidnap Flick Tarsley?"</font><br />
[Sat Dec  6 09:40:23 2008] : <b>(19550) Alan</b>: <font color='#000080'>Nope; just him.</font><br />
[Sat Dec  6 09:41:30 2008] : <b>(19555) Renate</b>: <font color='#000080'>"Where is Daniel now?"</font><br />
[Sat Dec  6 09:42:12 2008] : <b>(19550) Alan</b>: <font color='#000080'>Still in Tempest, assuming he got there; he might still be on the way. This all happened only three days ago.</font><br />
[Sat Dec  6 09:43:21 2008] : <b>(19555) Renate</b>: <font color='#000080'>"Have there been any telegrams?" They would know; telegrams aren't an everyday occurrence in Karlbotel.</font><br />

[Sat Dec  6 11:50:52 2008] : <b>(19550) Alan</b>: <font color='#000080'>On the final day, you can see Mount Davon rising in the distance, and through a spyglass you can see the military airships floating around the airport platform which rises above the rest of the city; no cargo airships, though, which are normally a huge part of Tempest's economy.</font><br />
[Sat Dec  6 11:51:44 2008] : <b>(19550) Alan</b>: <font color='#000080'>As the only nation on Northrock with a full airship fleet, Tempest makes a ton of profit lifting heavy cargo cross-country by zeppelin, and making international flights.</font><br />
[Sat Dec  6 11:52:44 2008] : <b>(19550) Alan</b>: <font color='#000080'>The latest newspapers from Davon City are available at the roadhouses; seems like there's a standoff between the Preservers and the so-called Freecrafters.</font><br />
[Sat Dec  6 11:53:48 2008] : <b>(19550) Alan</b>: <font color='#000080'>The Preservers kept their mage-guild-centric name even as they took up the cause of the trade guilds as well; the Sages, on the other hand, chose to make a larger name when they realized they'd inspired common workers and artisans to rebel against their guilds.</font><br />
[Sat Dec  6 11:54:12 2008] : <b>(19555) Renate</b>: <font color='#000080'>(Smart. Something Renate suggested, too.)</font><br />
[Sat Dec  6 11:55:04 2008] : <b>(19550) Alan</b>: <font color='#000080'>The different newspapers have a lot of insight into the political workings here; for instance, while the guilds have always been considered part of the "Establishment," they also fought for work reforms.</font><br />
[Sat Dec  6 11:55:37 2008] : <b>(19550) Alan</b>: <font color='#000080'>The guilds are telling the Freecrafters that the only thing they'll win is freedom to be exploited by employers and underbid by competitors.</font><br />
[Sat Dec  6 11:56:18 2008] : <b>(19550) Alan</b>: <font color='#000080'>The Freecrafters, on the other hand, are going on about the virtues of a free market for their services, which is ironic since the Sages' Republic territory holds everything in common.</font><br />
[Sat Dec  6 11:57:20 2008] : <b>(19550) Alan</b>: <font color='#000080'>The military is supporting the Freecrafters by blockading the airport; since its freight handling is guild-controlled, none of the riches were getting to the Freecrafters.</font><br />
[Sat Dec  6 11:58:08 2008] : <b>(19555) Renate</b>: <font color='#000080'>There's got to be a black market. And slower but reasonably reliable transport.</font><br />
[Sat Dec  6 11:58:14 2008] : <b>(19550) Alan</b>: <font color='#000080'>Karl Schoenmar, commander of the Red Wings and de facto admiral, has never exercised this kind of authority before; the dragon ruler Rivenlight suspects it's a coup, but if he acts on that, it will become one for sure.</font><br />
[Sat Dec  6 11:59:16 2008] : <b>(19550) Alan</b>: <font color='#000080'>Rivenlight is beloved by his people, but partly because of his benevolent absence from daily affairs. If he interferes wrong, he'll lose influence.</font><br />
[Sat Dec  6 11:59:30 2008] : <b>(19555) Renate</b>: <font color='#000080'>Renate's kind of dragon!</font><br />
[Sat Dec  6 11:59:54 2008] : <b>(19550) Alan</b>: <font color='#000080'>Artimecia is official head of the Preservers, but has given Leonid the reins here; nobody is sure whether she's in a back room pulling his strings or not.</font><br />
[Sat Dec  6 12:00:02 2008] : <b>(19550) Alan</b>: <font color='#000080'>Clearly she wants a human face for her alliance.</font><br />
[Sat Dec  6 12:00:20 2008] : <b>(19550) Alan</b>: <font color='#000080'>Anything to counter the strong populist appeal of the Freecrafters.</font><br />
[Sat Dec  6 12:00:59 2008] : <b>(19550) Alan</b>: <font color='#000080'>At the same time, the Preservers and the trade guilds are essential to everyday living; businesses all over the city have put up signs warning that they might have to shut down at any time, and to think carefully about that.</font><br />
[Sat Dec  6 12:01:15 2008] : <b>(19550) Alan</b>: <font color='#000080'>Banks, for instance, could freeze -- no free banks -- and plunge the city into chaos.</font><br />
[Sat Dec  6 12:02:24 2008] : <b>(19550) Alan</b>: <font color='#000080'>What's worse, if things go on long enough, or turn out poorly, Andragar or the Silver Coast might see a chance to annex Tempest despite their powerful air navy. The political vultures are circling. Even nearby Patchworks would like to peel off a slice of fresh farmland.</font><br />
[Sat Dec  6 12:02:57 2008] : <b>(19550) Alan</b>: <font color='#000080'>If the navy moves to respond to a threat, the Preservers win; they can secure the airport against the navy's return from the hot zone.</font><br />
[Sat Dec  6 12:03:31 2008] : <b>(19550) Alan</b>: <font color='#000080'>So, that's what you're walking into. You can try to resolve the conflict; or you can just find your shoemaker, find Daniel, find Flick, and leave.</font><br />

[Sat Dec  6 12:05:30 2008] : <b>(19555) Renate</b>: <font color='#000080'>And there are people she cares about involved, if the politics isn't reason enough. Leonid, and Torrance.</font><br />

[Sat Dec  6 12:06:40 2008] : <b>(19550) Alan</b>: <font color='#000080'>Sir Torrance is still back in the territory, but Deacon Murtaugh is around. The Sages themselves are barricaded in Gainesborough Castle, where their movement began.</font><br />
