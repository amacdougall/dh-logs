[Fri Sep 10 18:15:09 2004] : <B>Dorothea</B>: <font color='#000080'>I don't know that there was a "the" solution</font><br>
[Fri Sep 10 18:15:39 2004] : <B>Dorothea</B>: <font color='#000080'>what we ended up doing, after getting pounded, was shoving the basically-honest NG ranger out to broker a truce with her opposite number :)</font><br>
[Fri Sep 10 18:15:53 2004] : <B>Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>Fair enough.</font><br>
[Fri Sep 10 18:16:07 2004] : <B>Rob</B>: <font color='#000080'>In any case, they chose to fight the goblin horde instead of circumventing it and managed to win despite some crappy rolls. That was mistake number 1. What did them in was not taking time to catch their breath and maybe rest before plunging on to fight the chieftan who womped their wounded butts easily and their healing cleric (an NPC that was a shout-out to Adam Mayonet, actually) was forced to try to fight because he was completely out of spells.</font><br>
[Fri Sep 10 18:16:19 2004] : <B>Dorothea</B>: <font color='#000080'>but not before plenty of chances to confront some things they didn't like about themselves :)</font><br>

[Fri Sep 10 18:16:44 2004] : <B>Dorothea</B>: <font color='#000080'>yep, that'll get you killed</font><br>
[Fri Sep 10 18:17:43 2004] : <B>Dorothea</B>: <font color='#000080'>unless Trancey Rien gives you birthday presents *shrug*</font><br>
[Fri Sep 10 18:17:54 2004] : <B>Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>Anything called a "horde" goes first on my list of things not to fight.</font><br>
[Fri Sep 10 18:17:54 2004] : <B>Rob</B>: <font color='#000080'>Also, one of the characters spent the entire fight trying to stabalize the ranger that got dropped in the first round instead of actually fighting the chieftan.</font><br>
[Fri Sep 10 18:18:08 2004] : <B>Dorothea</B>: <font color='#000080'>eh</font><br>
[Fri Sep 10 18:18:20 2004] : <B>Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>It could be a horde of frightened children.</font><br>
[Fri Sep 10 18:18:25 2004] : <B>Dorothea</B>: <font color='#000080'>the length of the usual D&D fight is such that unless the ranger is really about to die, it's faster to kill the enemy</font><br>
[Fri Sep 10 18:18:39 2004] : <B>Dorothea</B>: <font color='#000080'>yep, hordes are bad</font><br>
[Fri Sep 10 18:18:47 2004] : <B>Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>Yep. That's one nice thing about D&D, things are usually over in thirty seconds of real time, if that.</font><br>
[Fri Sep 10 18:18:48 2004] : <B>Rob</B>: <font color='#000080'>Well, it was more like a dozen or so. Still, more than 1st level PCs should be taking on at one time if they have any sense.</font><br>
[Fri Sep 10 18:19:26 2004] : <B>Rob</B>: <font color='#000080'>Yup. Especially since the character in question had no Heal skill and was rolling raw Wisdom checks and failing repeatedly.</font><br>
[Fri Sep 10 18:21:07 2004] : <B>Rob</B>: <font color='#000080'>They also didn't have an Arcane caster (a couple magic missiles would have helped immensley against the chieftan.)</font><br>
[Fri Sep 10 18:21:38 2004] : <B>Rob</B>: <font color='#000080'>But no one wanted to be the mage. Hell, they wouldn't have had a full cleric if I hadn't given them the NPC.</font><br>
[Fri Sep 10 18:23:32 2004] : <B>Rob</B>: <font color='#000080'>Sad thing is they're all veteran players who should know better. Jim's about the only one with much of an excuse because he hasn't played enough 3.x yet to completely understand the rules.</font><br>
[Fri Sep 10 18:23:49 2004] : <B>Dorothea</B>: <font color='#000080'>so what's the plan now? new characters?</font><br>
[Fri Sep 10 18:24:39 2004] : <B>Rob</B>: <font color='#000080'>Yup. New characters, same mission. Which will be slightly easier because they managed to kill a chunk of the goblins, but harder in other ways because they're all on alert now.</font><br>
[Fri Sep 10 18:25:22 2004] : <B>Rob</B>: <font color='#000080'>They're actually making sure they have a cleric and a mage and full rogue this time, which will help.</font><br>
[Fri Sep 10 18:25:45 2004] : <B>Dorothea</B>: <font color='#000080'>I've always favored the evil-bribe route for dealing with hordes -- throw something into their midst that they'll fight over.</font><br>
[Fri Sep 10 18:25:47 2004] : <B>Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>You know, I kind of miss the old grinding style of game where you send your next characters to loot the corpses of the first ones.</font><br>
[Fri Sep 10 18:25:52 2004] : <B>Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>Maximize that starting gold.</font><br>
[Fri Sep 10 18:26:00 2004] : <B>Dorothea</B>: <font color='#000080'>Or at least be interested enough in to leave you alone for a couple rounds. :)</font><br>
[Fri Sep 10 18:26:07 2004] : <B>Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>I remember doing that back in Wizardry I.</font><br>
[Fri Sep 10 18:26:08 2004] : <B>Rob</B>: <font color='#000080'>Heh.</font><br>
[Fri Sep 10 18:26:44 2004] : <B>Rob</B>: <font color='#000080'>Actually, in this case they'll have to deal with goblins and hobgoblins using the former party's equipment. Which they can then loot if they win.</font><br>
[Fri Sep 10 18:26:53 2004] : <B>Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>Good touch.</font><br>
[Fri Sep 10 18:26:53 2004] : <B>Dorothea</B>: <font color='#000080'>nice</font><br>

[Fri Sep 10 18:29:13 2004] : <B>Dorothea</B>: <font color='#000080'>one game I was in, we had this huge hulking guy as a party member, the joke being that he was a real softie</font><br>

[Fri Sep 10 18:30:14 2004] : <B>Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>Heh.</font><br>
[Fri Sep 10 18:30:36 2004] : <B>Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>Reminds me of a tall tale I read once...</font><br>

[Fri Sep 10 18:32:03 2004] : <B>Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>He slams the bar door open so hard it whips around and smashes through the wall on the other side.</font><br>

[Fri Sep 10 18:32:16 2004] : <B>Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>He steps into the bar, leaving smoking footprints in the wood shavings on the floor.</font><br>
[Fri Sep 10 18:32:39 2004] : <B>Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>He demands <i>all</i> the liquor in the bar, and then just starts eating the bottles one by one, crunching the glass in the back of his teeth.</font><br>

[Fri Sep 10 18:33:54 2004] : <B>Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>He's kind of hungry after all that liquor, so he rips up the bar itself and starts chewing on the wood.</font><br>

[Fri Sep 10 21:35:43 2004] : <B>Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>(Mostly dealing with the consequences of Chapter 5, like his new mind.)</font><br>
[Fri Sep 10 21:35:56 2004] : <B>Dorothea</B>: <font color='#000080'>well, what she'll have said is along the lines of "nobody trusts me anyway, not even my own <i>family</i>, so why the hells should I expect you to?"</font><br>
[Fri Sep 10 21:35:57 2004] : <B>Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>Aryk >> He trips on a rock and dies.</font><br>

[Fri Sep 10 21:36:19 2004] : <B>Rob</B>: <font color='#000080'>Heh. Was it better or worse than the campaign with me, Kousuke, Jon and Justin where you were actively trying to kill us?</font><br>
[Fri Sep 10 21:36:35 2004] : <B>Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>The True Path? That was a good campaign.</font><br>
[Fri Sep 10 21:36:41 2004] : <B>Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>Every fighting game was in the same game world.</font><br>

[Fri Sep 10 21:37:08 2004] : <B>Aryk</B>: <font color='#000080'>Rob, it was only one session for me.  I did succeed in putting a trash can over Akuma's head, so that was cool.  </font><br>
[Fri Sep 10 21:37:13 2004] : <B>Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>Akuma was constantly popping up in random locations a la Street Fighter V.</font><br>

[Fri Sep 10 21:37:22 2004] : <B>Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>Yeah, and they attacked him once for no reason.</font><br>
[Fri Sep 10 21:37:29 2004] : <B>Rob</B>: <font color='#000080'>That was actually the way Tim Minear said he'd end the final episode of Angel. He becomes human then trips and breaks his neck.:)</font><br>
[Fri Sep 10 21:37:30 2004] : <B>Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>And then jumped off a bridge into a watermelon truck.</font><br>
