[Fri Jan  5 19:15:28 2007] : <B>(1) Alan</B>: <font color='#000000'>Right. Or a phone call, as in "yo, hit me up when you get a chance."</font><br>

[Fri Jan  5 19:16:08 2007] : <B>(1) Alan</B>: <font color='#000000'>Trouble with "grandiloquent," though, is that if you say it, you are.</font><br>

[Fri Jan  5 19:18:04 2007] : <B>(3) Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>A self-describing word, even.</font><br>
[Fri Jan  5 19:19:34 2007] : <B>(1) Alan</B>: <font color='#000000'>Okay, so what's the plan? You just got done discussing world affairs with Wren.</font><br>
[Fri Jan  5 19:20:30 2007] : <B>(1) Alan</B>: <font color='#000000'>It seems events in Sune have been proceeding at a breakneck pace since the king and the general made their move.</font><br>

[Fri Jan  5 19:21:09 2007] : <B>(3) Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>So we presumably need to work out a plan with him.</font><br>

[Fri Jan  5 19:23:48 2007] : <B>(1) Alan</B>: <font color='#000000'>See, I'm considering all the angles here.</font><br>
[Fri Jan  5 19:23:56 2007] : <B>(4) Aryk</B>: <font color='#a40000'>And Aryk has some plans that will involve powerful sorcery, so we'll have to get on that, too.</font><br>

[Fri Jan  5 19:29:59 2007] : <B>(4) Aryk</B>: <font color='#a40000'>"The path we walk doesn't usually come with quick answers, bro."</font><br>
[Fri Jan  5 19:30:11 2007] : <B>(1) Alan</B>: <font color='#000000'>"I'm still able to do divine magic without praying to any specific angel, but nobody has been able to tell whether that magic is, for lack of a better word, superangelic."</font><br>
[Fri Jan  5 19:30:36 2007] : <B>(3) Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>"Pre-angelic."</font><br>
[Fri Jan  5 19:30:46 2007] : <B>(1) Alan</B>: <font color='#000000'>"Could be that when I pray to the True King, the archangels answer. And yes, that's a good word."</font><br>

[Fri Jan  5 19:31:39 2007] : <B>(4) Aryk</B>: <font color='#a40000'>"That's great!"</font><br>
[Fri Jan  5 19:31:55 2007] : <B>(1) Alan</B>: <font color='#000000'>"Lately, I've been wondering whether it really matters where the power comes from. My heresy was more about ethics and motivation than about some literal magical water hose."</font><br>
[Fri Jan  5 19:32:06 2007] : <B>(2) Rien</B>: <font color='#004000'>"Is there any evidence that the Archangels can hear prayers that aren't directed to them?"</font><br>
[Fri Jan  5 19:32:19 2007] : <B>(3) Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>"They could listen," Renate suggests.</font><br>
[Fri Jan  5 19:32:51 2007] : <B>(1) Alan</B>: <font color='#000000'>"I wanted people to get their magic from a power higher than the Archangels just because I don't entirely trust the archangelic churches. That's the short of it."</font><br>
[Fri Jan  5 19:33:12 2007] : <B>(2) Rien</B>: <font color='#004000'>"If they do, however, and respond by giving you power, then it suggests that they are somewhat in support of you."</font><br>
[Fri Jan  5 19:33:45 2007] : <B>(1) Alan</B>: <font color='#000000'>Adam nods to Rien. "Exactly. It is as you say. A spiritual Power can 'listen' to the needs of anyone, and grant those needs or not at will."</font><br>
[Fri Jan  5 19:33:49 2007] : <B>(4) Aryk</B>: <font color='#a40000'>"Exactly!" says Aryk excitedly, downing more coffee.</font><br>
[Fri Jan  5 19:34:05 2007] : <font color='#008000'>** (3) Renate merely nods; if by now she has not made it perfectly obvious that she does not entirely trust the Churches either, there is little she can do to clarify the point now. **</font><br>
[Fri Jan  5 19:34:08 2007] : <B>(1) Alan</B>: <font color='#000000'>"The person praying, the supplicant, acts as a sort of conduit between the Power and the real world."</font><br>
[Fri Jan  5 19:34:41 2007] : <B>(1) Alan</B>: <font color='#000000'>"All the trappings of religion, the prayers we call 'spells', are just ways of making that path as straight as possible."</font><br>
[Fri Jan  5 19:35:45 2007] : <B>(1) Alan</B>: <font color='#000000'>"There are laws of divine magic same as there are laws of arcana. It takes a lot more divine essence to do something unusual, like cure an illness... so much that we've come to think of it as impossible."</font><br>
[Fri Jan  5 19:36:45 2007] : <B>(1) Alan</B>: <font color='#000000'>"That's why this business with the king has my mind flying off in all directions. He did cure the sick, and that's truly amazing."
