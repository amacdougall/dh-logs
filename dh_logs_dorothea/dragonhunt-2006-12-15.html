[Fri Dec 15 19:22:01 2006] : <B>(1) Alan</B>: <font color='#000000'>I kind of avoided giving names to every random fool at court, apparently so I wouldn't have to go look them up later (and apparently I was too lazy to just type them into my sprawling and disorganized notes).</font><br>
[Fri Dec 15 19:22:17 2006] : <B>(2) Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>We had a few dukes and the nasty little goblin that hexed us.</font><br>

[Fri Dec 15 19:22:45 2006] : <B>(1) Alan</B>: <font color='#000000'>So the only people to know about are the king, Joaquin "Silver Coin" Sirius, Soujuro Kozuke (the Silver Tree guy).</font><br>
[Fri Dec 15 19:22:54 2006] : <B>(1) Alan</B>: <font color='#000000'>And Toshiro Kensuke and Genjiro Hideki, of course.</font><br>
[Fri Dec 15 19:23:24 2006] : <B>(1) Alan</B>: <font color='#000000'>The original draft of the hobgoblin court also had a variety of princesses and whatnot, one of whom Kodaku married to unify the hobgoblin lands, but we're leaving them out as irrelevant to the plot this time around.</font><br>
[Fri Dec 15 19:24:17 2006] : <B>(2) Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>I got nothing against princesses. You want one to fall desperately in love with Rien, I'm all for it.</font><br>
[Fri Dec 15 19:24:46 2006] : <B>(2) Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>I bet they throw hella weddings around these parts.</font><br>
[Fri Dec 15 19:25:32 2006] : <B>(1) Alan</B>: <font color='#000000'>Hm. Given eight letters to work with, my license plate would be "LTMAR8EO".</font><br>
[Fri Dec 15 19:26:10 2006] : <B>(1) Alan</B>: <font color='#000000'>And yes, they do, but you also have to prove your noble blood by hunting a remorhaz.</font><br>

[Fri Dec 15 19:27:01 2006] : <B>(1) Alan</B>: <font color='#000000'>There's a whole subjob of huntmastery based on making them appear.</font><br>
[Fri Dec 15 19:27:30 2006] : <B>(1) Alan</B>: <font color='#000000'>You have to organize all the caribou and such into herds, and herd them into safe zones until the remorhaz get hungry enough to snap up the one or two lure animals you leave out on the tundra.</font><br>
[Fri Dec 15 19:27:47 2006] : <B>(4) Rien</B>: <font color='#004000'>Heh... I suppose you'd also have to prove that you've fallen in love with the princess, too.  It's not like there's anyone who's just going to arrange a marriage for him.</font><br>
[Fri Dec 15 19:27:52 2006] : <B>(1) Alan</B>: <font color='#000000'>Otherwise the only thing you'll ever find are the ice tunnels they leave as they burrow around.</font><br>
[Fri Dec 15 19:27:57 2006] : <B>(2) Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>Renate could be persuaded to. :)</font><br>
[Fri Dec 15 19:28:06 2006] : <B>(2) Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>Especially if it gives her a political link with Sune.</font><br>
[Fri Dec 15 19:28:24 2006] : <B>(1) Alan</B>: <font color='#000000'>And yeah, Rien marrying a winsome hobgoblin is an interesting subplot idea, but I'm not positive we need to go there.</font><br>
[Fri Dec 15 19:28:33 2006] : <B>(2) Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>Renate would make a lovely yenta.</font><br>
[Fri Dec 15 19:28:40 2006] : <B>(1) Alan</B>: <font color='#000000'>His father would put his foot down anyway.</font><br>
[Fri Dec 15 19:28:49 2006] : <B>(2) Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>lol! we'd just have to steal a march, then!</font><br>
[Fri Dec 15 19:29:12 2006] : <B>(1) Alan</B>: <font color='#000000'>And all Rien's friends would make nasty jokes about "arctic wasteland fever."</font><br>

[Fri Dec 15 19:29:32 2006] : <B>(2) Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>Yiddish matchmaker.</font><br>

[Fri Dec 15 19:29:48 2006] : <B>(2) Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>Has the connotation -- yes, exactly.</font><br>
[Fri Dec 15 19:30:25 2006] : <B>(2) Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>I thought you were a musicals fan, Adrian. You've never seen/heard Fiddler on the Roof?</font><br>

[Fri Dec 15 19:31:00 2006] : <B>(4) Rien</B>: <font color='#004000'>Nope, never had the ocassion to.</font><br>

[Fri Dec 15 19:34:11 2006] : <B>(1) Alan</B>: <font color='#000000'>Ricard's information from Ivanova was pretty vague; he isn't sure whether the king is at the palace, or if he's gone to the city.</font><br>
[Fri Dec 15 19:34:24 2006] : <B>(2) Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>Erm, and looking for the king in Vollis might also be good.</font><br>
[Fri Dec 15 19:34:28 2006] : <B>(1) Alan</B>: <font color='#000000'>Is Solara around? If I mentioned her, it was a while ago.</font><br>
[Fri Dec 15 19:34:39 2006] : <B>(2) Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>Not to our knowledge, but Kaplan was pretty adamant on the point.</font><br>
[Fri Dec 15 19:35:03 2006] : <B>(1) Alan</B>: <font color='#000000'>Okay. If I recall, the list time you saw her in the flesh was when she jumped out of the ruined toward to avoid Artimecia's attack.</font><br>

[Fri Dec 15 19:35:08 2006] : <B>(2) Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>Right.</font><br>
[Fri Dec 15 19:35:31 2006] : <B>(2) Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>Oh, and we might want to scope out the feeling in Vollis, see what we can confirm/deny of what Ivanova said. And find Adam, if we can.</font><br>
[Fri Dec 15 19:35:36 2006] : <B>(2) Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>That boy is probably trouble.</font><br>
[Fri Dec 15 19:35:48 2006] : <B>(1) Alan</B>: <font color='#000000'>Under the circumstances, warning her that Artimecia might not have the kindest of intentions toward her seems a shade redundant.</font><br>
[Fri Dec 15 19:35:48 2006] : <B>(3) Aryk</B>: <font color='#a40000'>As much as Aryk would like to sleep and shake off that whole impending doom thing, he's too excited Renate is saved, and too frazzled at the thought they mey have to go and stop Adam.</font><br>
[Fri Dec 15 19:36:28 2006] : <B>(4) Rien</B>: <font color='#004000'>But warning her that Artimecia is taking a direct hand in things in Sune isn't.</font><br>
[Fri Dec 15 19:36:38 2006] : <B>(1) Alan</B>: <font color='#000000'>Quite so.</font><br>
[Fri Dec 15 19:36:40 2006] : <B>(2) Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>Like I said, he can lean on Renate and catch a nap. She won't mind a bit.</font><br>

[Fri Dec 15 23:28:03 2006] : <B>(2) Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>(And she's still thinking about that one!)</font><br>
[Fri Dec 15 23:28:15 2006] : <B>(2) Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>(Nice jab, Alan. Got her right where she lives.)</font><br>
[Fri Dec 15 23:28:39 2006] : <B>(10) Alan</B>: <font color='#000000'>Heh.</font><br>
[Fri Dec 15 23:29:03 2006] : <B>(10) Alan</B>: <font color='#000000'>Anyway, there are things Ankoku knows about you that you don't know about yourself... but you have things over him too.</font><br>
[Fri Dec 15 23:29:33 2006] : <B>(2) Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>Which "you" do you mean?</font><br>
[Fri Dec 15 23:29:53 2006] : <B>(10) Alan</B>: <font color='#000000'>Well, obviously Rien.</font><br>
[Fri Dec 15 23:29:56 2006] : <B>(10) Alan</B>: <font color='#000000'>Renate too, though.</font><br>
[Fri Dec 15 23:29:57 2006] : <B>(4) Rien</B>: <font color='#004000'>Well, if Alan feels the need to say it, then it's gotta be Renate</font><br>
[Fri Dec 15 23:30:07 2006] : <B>(4) Rien</B>: <font color='#004000'>Because we already *know* he knows things about Rien that Rien doesn't know.</font><br>
[Fri Dec 15 23:30:34 2006] : <B>(2) Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>Well, I've always figured that the one being in Northrock who actually could cure Renate's eyes without ripping them out and replacing them would be Ankoku.</font><br>
[Fri Dec 15 23:30:48 2006] : <B>(2) Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>I just suspected he was waiting until he could use that against Rien.</font><br>
[Fri Dec 15 23:31:03 2006] : <B>(10) Alan</B>: <font color='#000000'>He's way too smart to think that would work.</font><br>
[Fri Dec 15 23:31:19 2006] : <B>(2) Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>heh</font><br>
[Fri Dec 15 23:31:43 2006] : <B>(2) Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>Rien's a softy. You never know.</font><br>
[Fri Dec 15 23:32:29 2006] : <B>(4) Rien</B>: <font color='#004000'>If anyone thinks he could play on Rien's sentimentality, it'd be DE.</font><br>
[Fri Dec 15 23:34:02 2006] : <B>(10) Alan</B>: <font color='#000000'>He is more aware of Rien's sentimentality than you know, but if he uses it, he'll use it wisely.</font><br>
[Fri Dec 15 23:34:18 2006] : <B>(2) Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>I'm not convinced there's much else about Renate to know. Unless one can peek into the future, which perhaps DE can.</font><br>
[Fri Dec 15 23:34:57 2006] : <B>(4) Rien</B>: <font color='#004000'>Among the many things that wouldn't surprise us.</font><br>
[Fri Dec 15 23:36:11 2006] : <B>(2) Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>I totally want to hear Baz speculating on the exact flavor of the Original Sauce, though.</font><br>
[Fri Dec 15 23:36:56 2006] : <B>(2) Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>Worcestershire!</font><br>
[Fri Dec 15 23:38:29 2006] : <B>(10) Alan</B>: <font color='#000000'>Huh. The latest Photoshop Friday on somethingawful.com has anagrams of video game titles.</font><br>
[Fri Dec 15 23:38:32 2006] : <B>(4) Rien</B>: <font color='#004000'>Original Sauce?</font><br>
[Fri Dec 15 23:38:44 2006] : <B>(2) Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>That which preceded both the angels and the demons.</font><br>
[Fri Dec 15 23:38:49 2006] : <B>(10) Alan</B>: <font color='#000000'>For instance, "Castlevania" becomes "Eats a Civilian" (actually quite appropriate since the game is about Dracula)</font><br>
[Fri Dec 15 23:38:51 2006] : <B>(2) Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>And is apparently powering Takemura.</font><br>
[Fri Dec 15 23:39:01 2006] : <B>(10) Alan</B>: <font color='#000000'>"Dragon Warrior" becomes "Rad Groin Arrow."</font><br>
[Fri Dec 15 23:39:08 2006] : <B>(2) Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>At least, that's my current hypothesis.</font><br>
[Fri Dec 15 23:39:37 2006] : <B>(2) Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>I sorta like the idea. Maybe, as I said, I'll let Takemura run with it.</font><br>
[Fri Dec 15 23:40:01 2006] : <B>(2) Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'><em>But</em> I want to know why Silver Coin skedaddled first.</font><br>
[Fri Dec 15 23:40:08 2006] : <B>(10) Alan</B>: <font color='#000000'>..."Shadow of the Colossus" is "Swoosh! Cloud of the Ass!" ...I shouldn't love anagrams as much as I do.</font><br>
[Fri Dec 15 23:40:37 2006] : <B>(10) Alan</B>: <font color='#000000'>Oh, the answer to that is that Takemura knows Silver Coin was helping brainwash him with those flash thingies.</font><br>
[Fri Dec 15 23:40:46 2006] : <B>(10) Alan</B>: <font color='#000000'>Even a dragonrank bard can get lynched.</font><br>
[Fri Dec 15 23:40:50 2006] : <B>(2) Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>heh</font><br>
[Fri Dec 15 23:40:52 2006] : <B>(2) Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>nice</font><br>

[Fri Dec 15 23:44:40 2006] : <font color='#008000'>** (4) Rien notes that one down to put on the whiteboard at work. **</font><br>
[Fri Dec 15 23:44:42 2006] : <B>(10) Alan</B>: <font color='#000000'>I mean, it's the Photoshops that make the jokes -- you take the original box or screenshots of the game and make it relate to the anagrammed version.</font><br>
[Fri Dec 15 23:45:07 2006] : <B>(2) Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>well, I have a concert tomorrow night, so I had better hit the hay</font><br>
[Fri Dec 15 23:45:24 2006] : <B>(2) Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>but I must say, if Hideki can keep his dragonlings in hand, I'm sorta liking the tactical situation if we let Takemura do his thing</font><br>
[Fri Dec 15 23:46:05 2006] : <B>(2) Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>And if not -- honestly, I'm not sure we're that much worse off; I doubt many of them are going to go sign up with Ankoku next.</font><br>
[Fri Dec 15 23:46:24 2006] : <B>(2) Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>And I like the idea of dragons learning that mortals can be worthwhile leaders.</font><br>
