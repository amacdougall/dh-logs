[Fri May 12 19:10:11 2006] : <B>(2) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>I hear they definitely require mental adjustment before you can use them as easily as paper.</font><br>
[Fri May 12 19:10:28 2006] : <B>(2) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>But once you've mapped the space on the pad to the space on the screen, you'll be in business.</font><br>
[Fri May 12 19:10:34 2006] : <B>(2) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>Just a matter of getting those neurons to click.</font><br>
[Fri May 12 19:10:35 2006] : <B>(4) Aryk</B>: <font color='#000080'>I re-did part of a pic I had done earlier, and to me, it actually looked better when done through the tablet onto Photoshop.</font><br>

[Fri May 12 19:11:10 2006] : <B>(2) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>Hey, there are a gazillion effects you can get with CG programs that you can't get with natural media; but except for actual 3D, the reverse is not true.</font><br>
[Fri May 12 19:11:30 2006] : <B>(2) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>Programs like Macromedia Painter have honest-to-god physics modeling of natural media.</font><br>

[Fri May 12 19:12:05 2006] : <B>(3) Rien</B>: <font color='#004000'>and the pad pays attention to the pressure you put on it.</font><br>
[Fri May 12 19:12:28 2006] : <B>(4) Aryk</B>: <font color='#000080'>I did a quick freehand on it, and it turned out pretty cool.  When I tried to trace a pic I had done before, it looked even better.  I have to get used to working with a within the allotted space, though.</font><br>
[Fri May 12 19:12:32 2006] : <B>(3) Rien</B>: <font color='#004000'>and most programs will allow you to specify what those alterations in pressure will do... do they increase the brush size, increas the saturation...</font><br>
[Fri May 12 19:12:32 2006] : <B>(4) Aryk</B>: <font color='#000080'>Oh yes it does.  It's sweet.</font><br>
[Fri May 12 19:12:34 2006] : <B>(2) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>I saw some of the really thick paints in a Painter demo... it looked like a 3D image of a fresh canvas, with great globs of some gelatinous eggy paint being smooshed around on it.</font><br>
[Fri May 12 19:12:49 2006] : <B>(2) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>Matt, don't think "allotted space" -- think scrolling.</font><br>
[Fri May 12 19:13:10 2006] : <B>(2) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>You do only have a given square at a time, but you can make as big a composition as you want.</font><br>
[Fri May 12 19:13:19 2006] : <B>(3) Rien</B>: <font color='#004000'>yep... you can move that alotted space anywhere you want on the screen.</font><br>
[Fri May 12 19:13:33 2006] : <B>(4) Aryk</B>: <font color='#000080'>It came with a program that is an add-on to photoshop that emphasizes the pressure-sensitive thing.  I'm looking forward to messing around with that.</font><br>
[Fri May 12 19:13:46 2006] : <B>(1) Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>I'd have gotten the large size, but it was a BIG price jump. :(</font><br>
[Fri May 12 19:13:53 2006] : <B>(4) Aryk</B>: <font color='#000080'>Yeah, it's a big adjustment to think that way for me, but I'm looking forward to it.</font><br>
[Fri May 12 19:14:01 2006] : <B>(4) Aryk</B>: <font color='#000080'>Oh, no, this is perfect, D.</font><br>
[Fri May 12 19:14:22 2006] : <B>(2) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>Stirring coffee; you three should think about what your characters would want to do within a time frame small enough to preclude a trip to Sune.</font><br>
[Fri May 12 19:14:33 2006] : <B>(4) Aryk</B>: <font color='#000080'>It's just that if I want to, say, use it to put comics on the cpu, I'll have to keep in mind moreso what size I'm working with.</font><br>
[Fri May 12 19:14:36 2006] : <B>(2) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>i.e. interlude/wrap-up stuff as opposed to initiating a whole new movement.</font><br>
[Fri May 12 19:14:49 2006] : <B>(1) Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>Well, Renate wants to head back to Xanadu.</font><br>
[Fri May 12 19:15:07 2006] : <B>(2) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>I don't have a plan for this session, because I figured you'd have plenty of things to wrap up.</font><br>
[Fri May 12 19:15:08 2006] : <B>(3) Rien</B>: <font color='#004000'>And talk to a certain PI</font><br>
[Fri May 12 19:15:09 2006] : <B>(1) Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>First she needs to check with Artagus/Mia to be sure it's okay to put a temple to Lyria locally.</font><br>
[Fri May 12 19:15:18 2006] : <B>(1) Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>Oh, crap, yeah, gotta talk to the Grandmaster.</font><br>
[Fri May 12 19:15:23 2006] : <B>(2) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>Meta-game, character-knowledge, think "getting your affairs in order before having to choose whether to join Soleil."</font><br>
[Fri May 12 19:15:28 2006] : <B>(4) Aryk</B>: <font color='#000080'>That's a pretty long trip.</font><br>
[Fri May 12 19:15:45 2006] : <B>(1) Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>Then she'll need to find and buy a place, and dedicate it.</font><br>
[Fri May 12 19:15:55 2006] : <B>(2) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>(And don't worry, you'll have a lot more information to work with before having to make that choice.)</font><br>
[Fri May 12 19:15:58 2006] : <B>(1) Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>I've got an idea for a program it could sponsor, but that can be fluffed rather than played out.</font><br>

[Fri May 12 19:16:44 2006] : <B>(1) Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>Other than that, I think her affairs are more or less settled. Though a trip to Karlbotel might be in order.</font><br>
[Fri May 12 19:16:47 2006] : <B>(1) Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>How about Aryk?</font><br>
[Fri May 12 19:17:05 2006] : <B>(4) Aryk</B>: <font color='#000080'>As for Aryk, he's on his way already to sorting out his own "affairs," so there aren't any particularly important things he has to do on the trip, aside from checking in with the Church here and there along the way.</font><br>
[Fri May 12 19:17:46 2006] : <B>(4) Aryk</B>: <font color='#000080'>Yeah, a trip to Karlbotel wouldn't be out of the question.</font><br>

[Fri May 12 19:18:42 2006] : <B>(4) Aryk</B>: <font color='#000080'>You'd be surprised to find out what Aryk has planned for Karlbotel.</font><br>
[Fri May 12 19:18:53 2006] : <B>(1) Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>Aryk. Has plans. For Karlbotel.</font><br>
[Fri May 12 19:18:58 2006] : <B>(1) Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>This I gotta see.</font><br>
[Fri May 12 19:19:07 2006] : <B>(1) Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>And possibly forestall.</font><br>
[Fri May 12 19:19:35 2006] : <B>(3) Rien</B>: <font color='#004000'>And perhaps point-and-laugh, depending</font><br>
[Fri May 12 19:19:38 2006] : <B>(4) Aryk</B>: <font color='#000080'>Totally not what you're thinking, D.</font><br>
[Fri May 12 19:19:46 2006] : <B>(1) Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>she wouldn't laugh at Aryk, not to his face</font><br>
[Fri May 12 19:19:47 2006] : <B>(4) Aryk</B>: <font color='#000080'>Or you either, Adrien.</font><br>
[Fri May 12 19:19:50 2006] : <B>(2) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>Sabine's in Lan'yaria right now, anyway; some lardy noblebeast insisted on whisking her away to a conference she'd expressed interest in.</font><br>
[Fri May 12 19:19:59 2006] : <B>(4) Aryk</B>: <font color='#000080'>Not to his face, eh?</font><br>
[Fri May 12 19:20:05 2006] : <B>(1) Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>Well, I hope she's having fun, then.</font><br>
[Fri May 12 19:20:15 2006] : <B>(2) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>She informed him, to the extent necessary to have a clean conscience, that he wasn't getting any no matter how much gold he showered on her.</font><br>
[Fri May 12 19:20:21 2006] : <B>(1) Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>Good for her.</font><br>
[Fri May 12 19:20:25 2006] : <B>(2) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>And now is soaking up advanced knowledge.</font><br>
[Fri May 12 19:20:33 2006] : <B>(1) Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>*Excellent* for her.</font><br>
[Fri May 12 19:20:39 2006] : <B>(1) Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>Renate thoroughly approves.</font><br>
[Fri May 12 19:20:53 2006] : <B>(1) Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>What is the topic of the conference, if one may inquire?</font><br>
[Fri May 12 19:21:09 2006] : <B>(2) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>As I've intimated, Sabine has looked at Emil's and Renate's courses, and realized that the future government of Karlbotel is quite possibly in her hands.</font><br>
[Fri May 12 19:21:18 2006] : <B>(2) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>If nothing else, Renate could get herself killed.</font><br>
[Fri May 12 19:21:30 2006] : <B>(1) Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>Renate thinks that Renate is quite likely to do just that. :)</font><br>
[Fri May 12 19:21:35 2006] : <B>(4) Aryk</B>: <font color='#000080'>Wow, we are just going from what drastic climate to another, aren't we?  In that case, Aryk will also have to make it a point to spend some dough on a new wardrobe, and another satchel.</font><br>
[Fri May 12 19:21:36 2006] : <B>(2) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>So the conference is a gathering of nobles and governors, on the very topic of governance itself.</font><br>
[Fri May 12 19:21:58 2006] : <B>(1) Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>Ah, very nice.</font><br>
[Fri May 12 19:22:35 2006] : <B>(2) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>Of course, she knows enough to expect that the real action will be in the famed backchannel, so that's her main focus.</font><br>
[Fri May 12 19:22:55 2006] : <B>(2) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>Look pretty enough to get invited to all the parties and lunches, look dignified enough to be taken seriously.</font><br>
[Fri May 12 19:23:19 2006] : <B>(1) Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>Take a leaf out of Renate's charm book and meet the right people.</font><br>

[Fri May 12 20:30:35 2006] : <B>(4) Aryk</B>: <font color='#000080'>(Nah, he listens.  Let's just move on.)</font><br>
[Fri May 12 20:30:36 2006] : <B>(2) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>Ander's still in the background; right now he's lifting something with his mind. He doesn't seem particularly good at that.</font><br>
[Fri May 12 20:30:47 2006] : <B>(2) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>(Just out of curiosity, what did Aryk have to say to him?)</font><br>

[Fri May 12 20:31:39 2006] : <B>(2) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>(Ah. Well, Ander's got his reasons, though who's to say if they're particularly good ones.)</font><br>
[Fri May 12 20:32:09 2006] : <B>(4) Aryk</B>: <font color='#000080'>(Well, Aryk doesn't think they are.  But no worries.  Like I said, better he didn't anyway.)</font><br>
[Fri May 12 20:32:28 2006] : <B>(1) Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>(Yep. Probably better. We do NOT need any more enemies.)</font><br>
[Fri May 12 20:32:56 2006] : <B>(4) Aryk</B>: <font color='#000080'>(Especially one like him.)</font><br>
[Fri May 12 20:35:35 2006] : <B>(2) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>Okay. Well, the Cloudgatherers have saved you space aboard the best ship they could find, which is, as promised, a cargo vessel, quickly converted to a refugee craft by enterprising carriers.</font><br>
[Fri May 12 20:36:03 2006] : <B>(1) Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>If it floats in the general direction of north, it'll do.</font><br>
[Fri May 12 20:36:15 2006] : <B>(2) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>They basically just chained a bunch of wooden table-bench affairs, seemingly stolen from a public park, down in the hold, with a bunch of grass mats along the bulkheads.</font><br>
[Fri May 12 20:36:26 2006] : <B>(4) Aryk</B>: <font color='#000080'>(What route are we talking?  Straight up the sea, or are we heading toward the Erethan area?)</font><br>
[Fri May 12 20:36:58 2006] : <B>(1) Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>(Erethan or Mardone would get us on the train.)</font><br>
[Fri May 12 20:37:05 2006] : <B>(2) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>Always Erethan, because going straight north would just dash you against the forbidding rocky shores that gave the continent its name.</font><br>
[Fri May 12 20:37:24 2006] : <B>(4) Aryk</B>: <font color='#000080'>(Yeah, and in a boat like that, you can only last so long.)</font><br>
[Fri May 12 20:38:18 2006] : <B>(2) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>Sparky, by the way, scrounged a diary and a few pencils from somewhere, and is keeping a list of accounts. He says he plans to pay back everything anybody gives him.</font><br>
[Fri May 12 20:38:48 2006] : <B>(1) Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>Oh, for heaven's sake. We owe him for translation services as it is. We'll work something out.</font><br>
[Fri May 12 20:38:57 2006] : <B>(2) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>He's also holding on to that silver Aryk paid him. "Investment capital."</font><br>
[Fri May 12 20:38:59 2006] : <B>(1) Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>I daresay he can work his passage, for example.</font><br>
[Fri May 12 20:39:49 2006] : <font color='#008000'>** (4) Aryk spends half of the trip conversing with the Cloudgatherers, the rest of it getting a feel for his new blade.  Oh, and complaining about food in between. **</font><br>
[Fri May 12 20:40:19 2006] : <B>(2) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>Well, the sea is pretty tranquil, so you're able to make it up to Erethan in perfectly good time on the trade winds. The food is terrible, though, which gives Aryk plenty to complain about.</font><br>
[Fri May 12 20:40:35 2006] : <B>(1) Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>Renate watches her opportunities, and takes the first one she finds to speak with Old Wolf in something vaguely resembling privacy.</font><br>
[Fri May 12 20:40:50 2006] : <B>(2) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>Mostly just rice and various types of rehydrated meat and vegetables, with occasional dashes of something pickled.</font><br>
[Fri May 12 20:41:15 2006] : <B>(4) Aryk</B>: <font color='#000080'>(He'd cut off his own hand if it meant he could eat some of Carragio's cooking)</font><br>

[Fri May 12 20:45:10 2006] : <B>(1) Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>She smiles. "Would you keep an eye on Aryk, when you can spare one? Write to him when you can. I can't give him the guidance he needs, and I trust you."</font><br>

[Fri May 12 20:47:30 2006] : <B>(2) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>Old Wolf chuckles. "Some do."</font><br>
[Fri May 12 20:47:48 2006] : <B>(2) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>"But right now, he knows just enough to be dangerous... to himself and to others."</font><br>

[Fri May 12 20:52:31 2006] : <B>(2) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>Erethan is known for its inviting sandy shores and its bustling seaport; and the stories are true, but the stories also make it seem bigger than it is.</font><br>
[Fri May 12 20:53:12 2006] : <B>(2) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>The truth is that Erethan has only about two of everything; it's about the size and activity of Eldorado, without the university, or Atlantis, without the glamor.</font><br>

[Fri May 12 20:58:43 2006] : <B>(1) Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>Charms, scrolls, whathaveyou?</font><br>
[Fri May 12 20:58:57 2006] : <B>(2) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>Old Wolf heads for a temple where he can make contact with an angel to report on the situation at Skyseek Tower; Prism immediately heads up into the wilderness. Seems he has a mission in Parnesse, and can't be seen arriving by any road.</font><br>
[Fri May 12 20:59:36 2006] : <B>(2) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>Definitely. You'd have to look around and ask a few well-worded questions to find them, but there are dealers in new and antique scrolls and spellbooks and items.</font><br>
[Fri May 12 20:59:46 2006] : <B>(2) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>And more publicly, there are dealers in household potions and charms.</font><br>
[Fri May 12 21:00:00 2006] : <B>(2) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>Depends on what level of power and knowledge you're looking for.</font><br>
[Fri May 12 21:00:01 2006] : <font color='#008000'>** (4) Aryk takes Old Wolf's lead.  He makes it a point to check in with the local church this time.   **</font><br>
[Fri May 12 21:00:19 2006] : <B>(1) Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>Well, if there's something interesting in the household vein, she might pick it up as another sort of gift -- but what she's really after is something for Rien.</font><br>
[Fri May 12 21:00:23 2006] : <B>(2) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>Oh, there are also Eastland and Ordillan shamans, again, some for the tourists and some for the real specialist.</font><br>
[Fri May 12 21:01:03 2006] : <B>(1) Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>She can duck out of the way of an attack, and Aryk's a tank -- but Rien needs some illusion magic, she thinks. Invisibility, image multiplication or displacement, something of that sort.</font><br>
[Fri May 12 21:03:22 2006] : <B>(1) Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>If she doesn't find it here, that's fine -- but she'll keep looking elsewhere until she finds it.</font><br>
[Fri May 12 21:03:23 2006] : <B>(2) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>Ah, okay. Well, the first store denies any knowledge of such things; the second direct you to the first; the first, when pressed, says that perhaps a certain regular at a local dive might have a contact; and so forth, until after an hour or two of frustration Renate finds herself in the kitsch-packed living room of Doreen Delerious, magical power-broker and amazingly bad artist.</font><br>
[Fri May 12 21:03:24 2006] : <B>(3) Rien</B>: <font color='#004000'>Yes, probably not a bad idea</font><br>
[Fri May 12 21:03:54 2006] : <font color='#008000'>** (1) Renate holds her elbows in and her hands in her lap, terrified of damaging something. **</font><br>
[Fri May 12 21:04:36 2006] : <B>(2) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>Her nomme de whatever is evident from the flashy signature that adorns each of her repugnant paintings; fortunately, Renate can only see them in glimpses through Doreen's eyes as that matron of many talents prepares tea.</font><br>
[Fri May 12 21:04:55 2006] : <B>(3) Rien</B>: <font color='#004000'>Invisibility, or displaced avoidance.</font><br>
[Fri May 12 21:04:56 2006] : <font color='#008000'>** (4) Aryk stands in the background with Sparky, analyzing a hanging portrait on the wall.  Giggles can be heard. **</font><br>
[Fri May 12 21:05:22 2006] : <B>(1) Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>"Gentlemen." Renate does not have to raise her voice for it to cut like Crescent Light.</font><br>
[Fri May 12 21:05:28 2006] : <B>(2) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>"So," she says, setting down a tray with tea and biscuits, "You are looking for a gift for a special someone? Someone who gets into a lot of trouble very often, by the sound of it."</font><br>
[Fri May 12 21:05:36 2006] : <B>(1) Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>"Yes, quite so."</font><br>
[Fri May 12 21:06:04 2006] : <font color='#008000'>** (4) Aryk and Sparky clear their throats, stand and attention, and after Aryk nudges him, they both behave themselves. **</font><br>
[Fri May 12 21:07:28 2006] : <B>(2) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>"Well, let me show you the jewel of my collection, a fine piece of craftsmanship&#8212;no, art&#8212;one of the last things created on the Forge of the Fates before it was shattered in the disharmony of '72."</font><br>
[Fri May 12 21:08:58 2006] : <B>(2) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>She takes a huge decorative Ordillan mask off the wall, and performs some sort of sleight of hand on its nostril; she extracts a tiny silvery dagger.</font><br>
[Fri May 12 21:09:22 2006] : <font color='#008000'>** (1) Renate turns up one palm to accept it. **</font><br>
[Fri May 12 21:09:35 2006] : <B>(2) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>Clearly it isn't even sharp, because she holds it by the blade, but it gives off the impression of sharpness, heightened by a specular gleam far beyond the muted lamplight.</font><br>
[Fri May 12 21:11:01 2006] : <B>(2) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>It has a thin chain looped through a ring on its hilt; she lowers it into Renate's hand. "If you wear it around your neck, and close your right fist around it&#8212;or left if you are left-handed&#8212;it will project a magical wall around you."</font><br>
[Fri May 12 21:11:24 2006] : <B>(2) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>"No living thing, nor any weapon made of metal, will be able to get through it."</font><br>
[Fri May 12 21:11:49 2006] : <B>(2) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>"Magic, or non-metal weapons, will be slowed and weakened."</font><br>
[Fri May 12 21:12:32 2006] : <B>(2) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>"The trouble is that as long as the shield is up, you cannot move the pendant. Which in effect means that you can't move at all."</font><br>
[Fri May 12 21:12:47 2006] : <B>(1) Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>"Surely such a powerful item as this interferes with other magic."</font><br>
[Fri May 12 21:12:51 2006] : <B>(2) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>"And of course nothing goes out, either. No staying inside it and firing away."</font><br>
[Fri May 12 21:13:07 2006] : <B>(1) Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>"Ah, I anticipate you. I apologize."</font><br>
[Fri May 12 21:13:21 2006] : <B>(2) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>"But it would be a wonderful way of holing up to heal during a fight, or to wait out a temporary threat."</font><br>
[Fri May 12 21:14:00 2006] : <B>(2) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>"I do not believe the shield ever weakens, but of course I haven't tried putting it to a serious test! Just had a neighborhood boy hammer at it with a sword for a while."</font><br>
[Fri May 12 21:14:19 2006] : <B>(1) Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>"Well, it isn't <em>precisely</em> what I was seeking," Renate says judiciously, "but I can see certain advantages to it." And the bargaining begins...</font><br>
[Fri May 12 21:14:48 2006] : <B>(2) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>"Well, this is quite a precious device, so perhaps you would like to see something less powerful, but also more... deceptive."</font><br>
[Fri May 12 21:14:59 2006] : <B>(2) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>"You did mention illusion, right?"</font><br>
[Fri May 12 21:15:00 2006] : <B>(1) Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>"What might you have?"</font><br>
[Fri May 12 21:15:06 2006] : <B>(1) Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>"Indeed I did."</font><br>
[Fri May 12 21:15:59 2006] : <B>(1) Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>She lays the tiny dagger around the neck of an Eastlands porcelain horse with all the delicacy she can contrive.</font><br>
[Fri May 12 21:16:26 2006] : <B>(2) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>"Well, let me show you Collier's Veil. This, now where is it... aha." She pulls a small box, the size of a box of chocolates, down from a high shelf.</font><br>
[Fri May 12 21:17:01 2006] : <B>(2) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>"This can be a nuisance, because the fabric itself is invisible." She gestures as if lifting a sheet or garment from the box.</font><br>
[Fri May 12 21:18:05 2006] : <B>(2) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>"But when you drape it over yourself, the same goes for you." She partially disappears; at least, her head and upper body do. Her waist and legs are still sitting on the sofa. Where her image cuts off, there is just a blur.</font><br>
[Fri May 12 21:18:30 2006] : <B>(2) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>"There are two problems with it. One is that if you drape it wrong, it makes too many things invisible..."</font><br>
[Fri May 12 21:18:51 2006] : <B>(1) Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>"There are those who see magic directly -- something vaguely planar, I understand. Are they able to perceive the veil and what it conceals?"</font><br>
[Fri May 12 21:18:54 2006] : <B>(2) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>More of Doreen disappears, but so do parts of the couch. You can see the wall and carpet through inexplicable blurry holes in the couch.</font><br>
[Fri May 12 21:19:19 2006] : <B>(2) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>She stands and shifts the fabric more, so that only she is invisible. "There we go, I think that is correct."</font><br>
[Fri May 12 21:20:05 2006] : <B>(2) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>"It is hard to judge the effect from inside," she explains. "This cloth blocks magical sight as well, as long as it isn't causing nonsense like disappearing couches."</font><br>
[Fri May 12 21:21:00 2006] : <B>(1) Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>"Mmm... it is an intriguing item, Mistress Delerious, but I fear it would be rather cumbersome in a conflict."</font><br>
[Fri May 12 21:21:28 2006] : <B>(2) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>"That is what I was afraid of. An expert and brave tailor might be able to fashion a garment from it, though."</font><br>
[Fri May 12 21:21:48 2006] : <B>(2) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>"Perhaps a sort of poncho."</font><br>
[Fri May 12 21:22:08 2006] : <B>(1) Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>"Fragile, I fear. You would not believe how many outfits I have gone through in just the last two weeks."</font><br>
[Fri May 12 21:22:23 2006] : <B>(4) Aryk</B>: <font color='#000080'>"Heh," snorts Aryk, unable to resist.  "Go with the veil, Rien.  I dare you."</font><br>
[Fri May 12 21:22:40 2006] : <B>(2) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>"Well, I have an item which would not last as long, but could be much more effective..."</font><br>
[Fri May 12 21:23:15 2006] : <B>(2) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>She opens a wicker chest and rummages through it, before pulling up an oval box. She flips it open to reveal something like a miniature bar of soap.</font><br>
[Fri May 12 21:24:24 2006] : <B>(3) Rien</B>: <font color='#004000'>(Heh... I hadn't said anything because I didn't think Rien was actually there, but okay)</font><br>
[Fri May 12 21:24:47 2006] : <B>(4) Aryk</B>: <font color='#000080'>(Sure... why not?)</font><br>
[Fri May 12 21:24:51 2006] : <B>(2) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>"This is actually a compressed dust. You grind it into pinches of powder and store them safely in a bag. When you toss a pinch of the powder into the air, it causes you to 'echo' visually&#8212;it will look like there are a dozen of you, with the latest always fading away like an echo."</font><br>
[Fri May 12 21:25:03 2006] : <B>(2) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>"Perfect for confusing anyone who might be interested in sticking something in you."</font><br>
[Fri May 12 21:25:22 2006] : <B>(1) Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>"Hm. Yes, I think that might do."</font><br>
[Fri May 12 21:25:24 2006] : <B>(4) Aryk</B>: <font color='#000080'>"We'll take it!"</font><br>
[Fri May 12 21:25:39 2006] : <B>(2) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>"But I would warn you against using it often, because the powder is also a drug. It makes you giddy as a schoolgirl!"</font><br>
[Fri May 12 21:25:52 2006] : <B>(2) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>"And whoever else happens to breathe it, too."</font><br>
[Fri May 12 21:25:58 2006] : <B>(3) Rien</B>: <font color='#004000'>(Because you don't go buying a gift for someone and have them along to see how much you spend on it, and ot ruin the surprise.  Plus Rien could be putting this time to good use, making contacts in the various guilds aorund the place, working his way up thorugh the Old By/Girl/Hobgoblin/Aseuxal Dwarf network)</font><br>
[Fri May 12 21:25:59 2006] : <B>(4) Aryk</B>: <font color='#000080'>"Heh.  We'll take two!"</font><br>
[Fri May 12 21:26:16 2006] : <B>(2) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>"An antidote potion will probably clear that up, but do it too often and who knows?"</font><br>
[Fri May 12 21:26:40 2006] : <B>(1) Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>"Well, the friend I have in mind -- has odd reactions to things; this might not even hurt him. We shall see."</font><br>
[Fri May 12 21:26:43 2006] : <B>(4) Aryk</B>: <font color='#000080'>(Good point.)</font><br>
[Fri May 12 21:27:12 2006] : <B>(1) Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>And the bargaining begins in earnest...</font><br>
[Fri May 12 21:29:49 2006] : <B>(2) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>Well, this is one of her less expensive items, particularly because it's consumable -- about fifteen dusts -- so you're able to walk away with it priced at six silver.</font><br>
[Fri May 12 21:30:12 2006] : <B>(1) Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>Reasonable.</font><br>
[Fri May 12 21:30:13 2006] : <B>(2) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>Sparky looks skeptical at the price even so.</font><br>
[Fri May 12 21:30:40 2006] : <B>(2) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>But letting him get his two cents in could just lead to disaster.</font><br>
[Fri May 12 21:30:41 2006] : <B>(1) Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>Well, a little lagniappe might not go amiss. :)</font><br>
[Fri May 12 21:30:49 2006] : <B>(1) Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>But no, Sparky can stay out of it.</font><br>
[Fri May 12 21:32:07 2006] : <B>(1) Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>He needs to get used to Northrock prices anyway.</font><br>

[Fri May 12 22:34:34 2006] : <B>(2) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>Lyria informs you that more and more people are praying to her, and though she can't give them much, she is giving them what signs she can&#8212;basically, hold on to your dreams.</font><br>
[Fri May 12 22:34:58 2006] : <B>(2) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>And she says her bargain with Whirlwind Lionheart has been paying off as well.</font><br>
[Fri May 12 22:35:09 2006] : <B>(1) Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>What do we owe him for that?</font><br>

[Fri May 12 22:36:24 2006] : <B>(2) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>Lyria basically says not to worry about it. She is arranging for his payment and she hopes, like the dreams of her supplicants, that it will be worth it.</font><br>
[Fri May 12 22:37:04 2006] : <B>(1) Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>Renate worries about everything. It's her nature. Is there really nothing she can do to pay Lionheart off?</font><br>
[Fri May 12 22:38:28 2006] : <B>(2) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>Nothing immediately. He is not a tycoon of money so much as a dealer in fates; the money is, in Lyria's phrasing, "the corpse of opportunity."</font><br>
[Fri May 12 22:38:43 2006] : <B>(1) Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>Ugh. That sounds thoroughly vile.</font><br>
