[Fri Jun 24 18:07:34 2005] : <B>Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>Don't you hate it when you bite the inside of your lip, and it gets all puffy, so then you're just more likely to bite it again?</font><br>
[Fri Jun 24 18:07:40 2005] : <B>Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>Yep. That sucks.</font><br>
[Fri Jun 24 18:07:41 2005] : <B>Rien</B>: <font color='#004040'>yes</font><br>

[Fri Jun 24 18:07:49 2005] : <B>Rien</B>: <font color='#004040'>although in my case it's the inside of my cheek</font><br>
[Fri Jun 24 18:08:29 2005] : <B>Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>By the way, Carragio's selling things during your show was to point out that no matter what, you're going to get commercialized. :)</font><br>
[Fri Jun 24 18:08:31 2005] : <B>Aryk</B>: <font color='#000080'>Maybe you didn't bite it.  Could be herpes.  </font><br>
[Fri Jun 24 18:08:45 2005] : <B>Aryk</B>: <font color='#000080'>That's alright, Carragio's his home-boy.</font><br>
[Fri Jun 24 18:08:57 2005] : <B>Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>Well, if Aryk's album makes us a ton of money, I don't think we should complain.</font><br>
[Fri Jun 24 18:09:07 2005] : <B>Aryk</B>: <font color='#000080'>And it worked, because I got to use the line, "Like Carragio LaPlace / I make cold cuts"</font><br>
[Fri Jun 24 18:09:11 2005] : <B>Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>LOL</font><br>
[Fri Jun 24 18:09:17 2005] : <B>Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>Which I liked.</font><br>
[Fri Jun 24 18:09:19 2005] : <B>Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>Besides, we can rather use the money at present.</font><br>
[Fri Jun 24 18:09:53 2005] : <B>Aryk</B>: <font color='#000080'>Aryk's doing okay.  He has about 10 gold.  That outta last him quite a while, since he hasn't been gambling.</font><br>
[Fri Jun 24 18:10:21 2005] : <B>Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>Ren's replaced some equipment, and I suspect we're all in hock to the Raphaelites at the moment.</font><br>
[Fri Jun 24 18:10:28 2005] : <B>Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>You can live off that pretty well for about a half a year, as long as you're doing the solitary-apartment thing.</font><br>
[Fri Jun 24 18:10:38 2005] : <B>Aryk</B>: <font color='#000080'>Cool</font><br>
[Fri Jun 24 18:10:56 2005] : <B>Aryk</B>: <font color='#000080'>And as long as he stops leaving silver for tips at Tifan's.</font><br>
[Fri Jun 24 18:11:08 2005] : <B>Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>heh</font><br>
[Fri Jun 24 18:11:14 2005] : <B>Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>And yes, the Raphaelites probably took a twentieth. A discount, given Renate's and Aryk's services.</font><br>
[Fri Jun 24 18:11:27 2005] : <B>Aryk</B>: <font color='#000080'>I gave 'em two gold!</font><br>
[Fri Jun 24 18:11:37 2005] : <B>Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>Oh, then you're good.</font><br>
[Fri Jun 24 18:11:46 2005] : <B>Aryk</B>: <font color='#000080'>I was gonna say... </font><br>
[Fri Jun 24 18:11:53 2005] : <B>Aryk</B>: <font color='#000080'>:-)</font><br>
[Fri Jun 24 18:12:13 2005] : <B>Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>So what remains to be done that's a ramification or follow-on to Chapter 6?</font><br>
[Fri Jun 24 18:12:23 2005] : <B>Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>Nothing but fluff, as far as I can tell.</font><br>
[Fri Jun 24 18:12:42 2005] : <B>Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>Minor matters like making sure Torrenne has somebody to escort her up to Credo Vallar.</font><br>
[Fri Jun 24 18:12:53 2005] : <B>Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>Either Coris or Talos can probably swing that.</font><br>
[Fri Jun 24 18:13:14 2005] : <B>Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>And Aryk's incredibly lucrative album deal. :)</font><br>
[Fri Jun 24 18:13:26 2005] : <B>Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>Which somebody offered him on the spot, I'm sure.</font><br>
[Fri Jun 24 18:13:42 2005] : <B>Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>Hm. Dammit, bit my lip again. Fuck.</font><br>
[Fri Jun 24 18:13:44 2005] : <B>Aryk</B>: <font color='#000080'>Huh, he should be so lucky</font><br>
[Fri Jun 24 18:13:57 2005] : <B>Aryk</B>: <font color='#000080'>Aryk not Alan.  With his herpes.</font><br>
[Fri Jun 24 18:14:06 2005] : <B>Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>Okay, you folks should talk among yourselves and ask what you'll be doing a week or two later, when Rien wakes up.</font><br>
[Fri Jun 24 18:14:44 2005] : <B>Aryk</B>: <font color='#000080'>Well, the record deal thing is important, but it's not something that he entirely expects to get resolved within a week or two.</font><br>
[Fri Jun 24 18:14:59 2005] : <B>Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>He can do some studio tracks, though. We've got enough money to rent the space.</font><br>
[Fri Jun 24 18:15:36 2005] : <B>Aryk</B>: <font color='#000080'>And he's not so much looking for a deal, as he just is looking for someone to help him put out butt-loads of copies, and then he'll probably say laterz to the rap game.</font><br>
[Fri Jun 24 18:15:49 2005] : <B>Aryk</B>: <font color='#000080'>Yeah, he definitely wants to get it all recorded.</font><br>
[Fri Jun 24 18:16:02 2005] : <B>Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>I think what we might do, given the geography and all, is zip down to Rivalon (Ilium to Eldorado by sea, then Rivalon by train) and discuss Things Churchly, and then take a turn northward to Tempest, figure out WTF the mage knights are doing.</font><br>
[Fri Jun 24 18:16:05 2005] : <B>Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>Any objections?</font><br>
[Fri Jun 24 18:16:19 2005] : <B>Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>Well, record "deal" implies that someone wants to publish you just yet. You'd have to keep pounding the pavement and doing shows before you got scouted.</font><br>
[Fri Jun 24 18:16:22 2005] : <B>Aryk</B>: <font color='#000080'>He'll even distribute them himself if need be.</font><br>
[Fri Jun 24 18:16:31 2005] : <B>Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>You can just put it out on your own dime, and hire some shills to sell it.</font><br>
[Fri Jun 24 18:16:49 2005] : <B>Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>Well, Renate definitely thinks Aryk should keep performing, whenever and wherever he can.</font><br>
[Fri Jun 24 18:16:54 2005] : <B>Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>Ah,you're ahead of me.</font><br>
[Fri Jun 24 18:17:09 2005] : <B>Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>He's their mouthpiece, and doing songs seems to help him think things out.</font><br>
[Fri Jun 24 18:17:12 2005] : <B>Aryk</B>: <font color='#000080'>Right.  It's not a record deal he needs.  It's a means to get a studio version created, and then many copies made.  Who knows, I might even give them away.</font><br>
[Fri Jun 24 18:17:37 2005] : <B>Aryk</B>: <font color='#000080'>In that case he might do that, Alan.  And D, that sounds good to me.</font><br>
[Fri Jun 24 18:17:55 2005] : <B>Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>Okay, then.</font><br>
[Fri Jun 24 18:18:00 2005] : <B>Aryk</B>: <font color='#000080'>He may or may not.  Depends on circumstances.  After Rivalon, rhyming might be the last thing on his mind.</font><br>
[Fri Jun 24 18:18:22 2005] : <B>Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>Fair enough. We'll see if Renate gets them thrown out of the Burning Rose. *grin*</font><br>
[Fri Jun 24 18:18:42 2005] : <B>Aryk</B>: <font color='#000080'>Heh, I doubt that, though.  She's too polite.</font><br>
[Fri Jun 24 18:18:51 2005] : <B>Aryk</B>: <font color='#000080'>And if they kept Aryk around...</font><br>
[Fri Jun 24 18:18:52 2005] : <B>Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>She's thoroughly pissed at how they've treated Aryk, though.</font><br>
[Fri Jun 24 18:19:10 2005] : <B>Aryk</B>: <font color='#000080'>Hmm, true.</font><br>
[Fri Jun 24 18:19:36 2005] : <B>Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>I'm not sure how they're going to react to a big can of OMGWTF???</font><br>
[Fri Jun 24 18:19:52 2005] : <B>Aryk</B>: <font color='#000080'>Heh heh</font><br>
[Fri Jun 24 18:20:22 2005] : <B>Aryk</B>: <font color='#000080'>What do you think Adrian?  Rivalon, then the mage knights?</font><br>
[Fri Jun 24 18:20:28 2005] : <B>Rien</B>: <font color='#004040'>yep yep</font><br>
[Fri Jun 24 18:20:33 2005] : <B>Aryk</B>: <font color='#000080'>Cool.</font><br>
[Fri Jun 24 18:20:39 2005] : <B>Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>Okay, so Alan, let's call that a plan. If it's not enough of a plan, add a trip to Xanadu (to talk with Mia Schala) and thence to Sune.</font><br>
[Fri Jun 24 18:20:54 2005] : <B>Aryk</B>: <font color='#000080'>I'm so honored to get to be the first story arc of the free-roaming sessions.  Sniff sniff</font><br>
[Fri Jun 24 18:20:59 2005] : <B>Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>Aw, we love you, man.</font><br>
[Fri Jun 24 18:21:04 2005] : <B>Aryk</B>: <font color='#000080'>Awww..</font><br>
[Fri Jun 24 18:21:05 2005] : <B>Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>Okay... I believe we'll occupy this session with the visit to Rivalon; there will be Occurrences.</font><br>
[Fri Jun 24 18:21:11 2005] : <B>Aryk</B>: <font color='#000080'>:-)</font><br>
[Fri Jun 24 18:21:13 2005] : <B>Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>Ooo, occurrences.</font><br>
[Fri Jun 24 18:21:19 2005] : <B>Aryk</B>: <font color='#000080'>Counting on it.</font><br>
[Fri Jun 24 18:21:49 2005] : <B>Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>I'll try to remember to catch up on fluff to fill in the gaps pre-Chapter-7. Dorothea, do bug me about it.</font><br>
[Fri Jun 24 18:21:55 2005] : <B>Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>Okay.</font><br>
[Fri Jun 24 18:22:00 2005] : <B>Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>Oh, and Saturday the 2nd works.</font><br>
[Fri Jun 24 18:22:23 2005] : <B>Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>Excellent. For us too.</font><br>
[Fri Jun 24 18:22:50 2005] : <B>Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>I'd almost certainly be rolling into town way earlier; I have some other friends to meet; and I could help move things around then, too.</font><br>
[Fri Jun 24 18:23:33 2005] : <B>Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>Awesome.</font><br>
[Fri Jun 24 18:24:09 2005] : <B>Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>Okay, I have a general idea of what's going on at the Burning Rose, but I'll have to sort of improvise and try to scribble as we go.</font><br>
[Fri Jun 24 18:24:13 2005] : <B>Aryk</B>: <font color='#000080'>Cool, I think Jenny may come as well.</font><br>
[Fri Jun 24 18:24:35 2005] : <B>Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>Whenever you're ready, then, Alan.</font><br>
[Fri Jun 24 18:25:12 2005] : <B>Alan  </B>: <font color='#000080'>You get to the Burning Rose.  Aryk becomes a demi-god.</font><br>
[Fri Jun 24 18:25:17 2005] : <B>Aryk</B>: <font color='#000080'>Yeah!</font><br>
[Fri Jun 24 18:25:34 2005] : <B>Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>Well, it's about goddamn time.</font><br>

[Fri Jun 24 21:36:42 2005] : <B>Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>I can't deny it was "rape," but the reaction at the time was that their original attraction was simply chain-fired by the shrine of Chloe.</font><br>
