[Sat Sep 20 11:53:43 2008] : <b>(6) Alan</b>: <font color='#000080'>Well, they weren't avoidable, but Rien also recognizes them as pretty minor; he's able to vaporize them as they hit his skin at the cost of a dozen pinpricks, a bunch of rips in his clothes, and some magic.</font><br />

[Sat Sep 20 11:55:10 2008] : <b>(6) Alan</b>: <font color='#000080'>The Astral Sword grows more powerful the deeper into the astral plane you go; in the Mirror Realm, it's still strong enough to destroy the ghosts before they can do much to him; one goes down, and the second throws up a magic wall -- Sliced -- and that ghost is destroyed as well.</font><br />
[Sat Sep 20 11:56:30 2008] : <b>(6) Alan</b>: <font color='#000080'>A moment later, six Riskbreakers join the fray, coming up from the basement where they were waiting, and the mercenaries start to take the worse of it.</font><br />

[Sat Sep 20 12:00:01 2008] : <b>(6) Alan</b>: <font color='#000080'>The rest of the fleeing invisible mercenaries find themselves in an even worse situation -- they were trying to run down an alley that leads out to northern Alhambra Park.</font><br />
[Sat Sep 20 12:00:47 2008] : <b>(6) Alan</b>: <font color='#000080'>Instead, the alley ends in a finely-wrought granite block wall with a little crenelated castle tower in the middle of it.</font><br />
