[Fri May 28 23:33:32 2004] : <B>(1) Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>interesting... how archaic is archaic?</font><br>
[Fri May 28 23:33:33 2004] : <B>(2) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>Dating from at least five centuries ago&#8212;maybe more, but their records have predictable lacunae.</font><br>

[Fri May 28 23:33:50 2004] : <B>(2) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>They do know that there were proto-mage-knights even in elven days.</font><br>
[Fri May 28 23:34:07 2004] : <B>(2) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>They had different names for everything, but the basics ideas and techniques were similar.</font><br>

[Fri May 28 23:37:31 2004] : <B>(2) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>But he had a ring of water breathing, and just swam down too far for anyone to get to him...</font><br>

[Fri May 28 23:41:39 2004] : <B>(1) Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>Well, we may yet need them; they seem to run things off the coast of Gereval. And if there's this effing pirate problem off Atlantis, well...</font><br>
[Fri May 28 23:42:27 2004] : <B>(2) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>Yeah, there isn't a Temple of Leviathan on the Gray Ocean, which is honestly one of the reasons both Lan'yaria/Silver Coast trade and piracy have flourished.</font><br>
[Fri May 28 23:42:44 2004] : <B>(2) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>With a Temple there, pirates would have a very hard time, but trade would also be curtailed by the anti-piracy levies.</font><br>

[Fri May 28 23:43:43 2004] : <B>(1) Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>sounds like a plan</font><br>
[Fri May 28 23:43:44 2004] : <B>(1) Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>or something</font><br>
