"Pressurize!" she commands, and everyone in her unit twists a valve-like buckle on their green suits.

A pitch-black elf, two meters tall, dressed in Heaven armor. Unarmed. Dark Eternal's war form. But although he has passed through the door, he doesn't seem to see what is ahead of him; he's walking slowly, turning at right angles from time to time, traveling in an odd pattern as if traversing a tiny maze drawn on the ground.</font><br />

Inertial barrier, teleportation barrier, mental barrier.</font><br />
[Fri Jan 22 20:32:10 2010] : <b>(2548) Alan</b>: <font color='#000080'>To her it is invisible; but to Rien, each barrier has its own shape, not quite visual, but easily visualized -- the seven layers bring everything into focus for her.</font><br />
