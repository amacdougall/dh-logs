[Sat Nov 13 22:04:13 2004] : <B>Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>But she's also not sheltered like Sabine. She doesn't, for instance, moisturize each day.</font><br>
[Sat Nov 13 22:04:19 2004] : <B>Aryk</B>: <font color='#000080'>And that's an important thing for a live interest.</font><br>

[Sat Nov 13 22:05:00 2004] : <B>Dorothea</B>: <font color='#000080'>well, part of Renate's raison d'etre is making sure Sabine doesn't have to rise to occasions</font><br>
[Sat Nov 13 22:05:07 2004] : <B>Dorothea</B>: <font color='#000080'>Renate is pretty convinced that's <i>her</i> job.</font><br>
[Sat Nov 13 22:05:21 2004] : <B>Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>Well, who knows how Emily really acts when put in a fighting situation? So far you've only seen her fighting against evil forces with long odds.</font><br>
[Sat Nov 13 22:06:02 2004] : <B>Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>Maybe she got all that mercenary gear from one or two would-be rapists at a time; or maybe she's some ultra-powered Deadly Fighter type who wipes out entire armies.</font><br>
[Sat Nov 13 22:06:22 2004] : <B>Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>For that matter, maybe it's even more prosaic, and she really does join the crows and old women on the field of defeat.</font><br>
[Sat Nov 13 22:06:23 2004] : <B>Dorothea</B>: <font color='#000080'>Well, we know what Lehron thinks. :)</font><br>
[Sat Nov 13 22:06:31 2004] : <B>Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>That would be sad but realistic.</font><br>
[Sat Nov 13 22:06:59 2004] : <B>Aryk</B>: <font color='#000080'>Well, she's inhumanly strong, and has proven to be a rival to Garland Stahl, so she can't be that bad in a one-on-one fight.</font><br>
[Sat Nov 13 22:07:16 2004] : <B>Dorothea</B>: <font color='#000080'>True enough.</font><br>
[Sat Nov 13 22:07:26 2004] : <B>Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>Rival? She jumped as far as he did, but when they clashed in midair, he just blasted her to the ground in one hit.</font><br>
[Sat Nov 13 22:07:29 2004] : <B>Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>Took her out of the fight entirely.</font><br>

[Sat Nov 13 22:08:20 2004] : <B>Aryk</B>: <font color='#000080'>Well, yeah, but she was hefting a sword most soldiers would struggle to lift in one hand, mid-air, at the time!</font><br>
[Sat Nov 13 22:08:23 2004] : <B>Big Rob</B>: <font color='#004040'>next time she may very well be able to counter that move</font><br>
[Sat Nov 13 22:08:25 2004] : <B>Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>So far, though, even in Lehron's account, she hasn't proven to be more than a talented and probably dangerous junior PC-class adventuress.</font><br>

[Sat Nov 13 22:11:58 2004] : <B>Dorothea</B>: <font color='#000080'>yep, true dat</font><br>

[Sat Nov 13 22:12:16 2004] : <B>Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>Fair enough.</font><br>
[Sat Nov 13 22:12:36 2004] : <B>Dorothea</B>: <font color='#000080'>you don't want to watch Renate getting her ass kicked by half of Heaven and then handed over to her father's enemy?</font><br>
[Sat Nov 13 22:12:37 2004] : <B>Aryk</B>: <font color='#000080'>So she has told me!  Alan, you need to tell me some stuff about Renate so I can hold if over Dorothea's head!</font><br>

[Sat Nov 13 22:12:59 2004] : <B>Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>No, because the things about Renate are also meant to be complete shocks to the rest of you.</font><br>
[Sat Nov 13 22:13:10 2004] : <B>Aryk</B>: <font color='#000080'>Grrrr..</font><br>
[Sat Nov 13 22:13:17 2004] : <B>Big Rob</B>: <font color='#004040'>just like the stuff about Rien I don't know yet</font><br>
[Sat Nov 13 22:13:21 2004] : <B>Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>Hm. I could tell you what'll happen during one of Renate's side quests, but it's not really a revelation you can hold over her.</font><br>
[Sat Nov 13 22:13:38 2004] : <B>Big Rob</B>: <font color='#004040'>although Emily knows amore about Rien than Rien does, which menas Whirlwind welched on thier bargain</font><br>
[Sat Nov 13 22:13:38 2004] : <B>Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>It would just be a secret you know.</font><br>
[Sat Nov 13 22:13:38 2004] : <B>Dorothea</B>: <font color='#000080'>Oh, go on and tell him. It'll make him feel better.</font><br>

[Sat Nov 13 22:14:44 2004] : <B>Dorothea</B>: <font color='#000080'>I don't think WL had any bargain with you to welch on, Rien.</font><br>
[Sat Nov 13 22:14:47 2004] : <B>Big Rob</B>: <font color='#004040'>So, yes... Whirlwind Lionheart is a big deal-welching poo-head</font><br>
[Sat Nov 13 22:15:10 2004] : <B>Dorothea</B>: <font color='#000080'>Don't look at me. I'm totally biased on the subject of WL. But I still don't recall any bargain.</font><br>
[Sat Nov 13 22:15:17 2004] : <B>Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>Yeah, what were the details?</font><br>
[Sat Nov 13 22:15:22 2004] : <B>Big Rob</B>: <font color='#004040'>yes, he did, he promised Rien he'd tell him about some things concerning his personalities in return for something, jsut before the Bounty Strike</font><br>
[Sat Nov 13 22:15:45 2004] : <B>Dorothea</B>: <font color='#000080'>yeah, and you never got in touch with him to confirm the deal that I recall</font><br>
[Sat Nov 13 22:16:04 2004] : <B>Big Rob</B>: <font color='#004040'>yes, we said at the stat that we had and we'd hash out the details later</font><br>
[Sat Nov 13 22:16:06 2004] : <B>Dorothea</B>: <font color='#000080'>probably my fault; Renate got burned so badly by WL that we're all too leery of making deals for information</font><br>
[Sat Nov 13 22:16:25 2004] : <B>Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>Huh. Did we ever decide what the actual deal was?</font><br>
[Sat Nov 13 22:16:40 2004] : <B>Dorothea</B>: <font color='#000080'>Not that I recall.</font><br>
[Sat Nov 13 22:16:58 2004] : <B>Dorothea</B>: <font color='#000080'>And I honestly don't remember saying we were going to make the deal.</font><br>
[Sat Nov 13 22:17:02 2004] : <B>Big Rob</B>: <font color='#004040'>you didn't specify what he asked in return, but RIen apparently agreed becuase it was something he would have done anyway</font><br>
[Sat Nov 13 22:17:22 2004] : <B>Dorothea</B>: <font color='#000080'>And I don't see what that has to do with WL selling information to somebody else.</font><br>
[Sat Nov 13 22:17:22 2004] : <B>Big Rob</B>: <font color='#004040'>well I do, but I don't know if it's these meds affecting my memory again or not now</font><br>
[Sat Nov 13 22:18:30 2004] : <B>Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>Well, unless Whirlwind Lionheart specifically said he wouldn't tell anyone else about Rien, there probably isn't a prohibition.</font><br>
[Sat Nov 13 22:18:48 2004] : <B>Dorothea</B>: <font color='#000080'>That's what I figured too.</font><br>
[Sat Nov 13 22:18:52 2004] : <B>Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>I'm sure all his contracts have a boilerplate stipulation like "any rights or prohibitions not expressly stated shall not apply".</font><br>
[Sat Nov 13 22:19:10 2004] : <B>Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>And even if there was a statement, he could probably circumvent its wording.</font><br>
[Sat Nov 13 22:19:19 2004] : <B>Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>That's a trait of all Faerie, not just WL.</font><br>
[Sat Nov 13 22:19:25 2004] : <B>Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>They're very tricky.</font><br>
[Sat Nov 13 22:19:38 2004] : <B>Dorothea</B>: <font color='#000080'>Well, FWIW, he basically kept his word to Renate re: Lyria.</font><br>
[Sat Nov 13 22:19:57 2004] : <B>Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>Among demons, on the stealthy ones like Ghoster or Sambrotahka's patron play word-games with their promises.</font><br>
[Sat Nov 13 22:20:04 2004] : <B>Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>But Faerie? Even the good ones do it.</font><br>
[Sat Nov 13 22:20:12 2004] : <B>Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>Even Lyria. (poke poke)</font><br>
[Sat Nov 13 22:20:16 2004] : <B>Big Rob</B>: <font color='#004040'>ok... I'm shutting up now.  I remember something happening, but with each passing second I'm less and less sure about what I remember...</font><br>

[Sat Nov 13 22:20:26 2004] : <B>Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>You just have to make sure they're on your side.</font><br>
[Sat Nov 13 22:20:29 2004] : <B>Dorothea</B>: <font color='#000080'>Well, she is a bit more responsibility than Renate needs right now, true.</font><br>
[Sat Nov 13 22:20:41 2004] : <B>Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>Motivations, not boundaries, are what are important to Faerie loyalty.</font><br>
[Sat Nov 13 22:20:58 2004] : <B>Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>Oh, the Lyria thing can sit on the back burner until after the Purgatory tour.</font><br>
[Sat Nov 13 22:21:03 2004] : <B>Dorothea</B>: <font color='#000080'>Hm. Is Dorothy Durai part fae?</font><br>
[Sat Nov 13 22:21:12 2004] : <B>Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>Then, spreading her worship is one of the many things you could choose to dedicate some time to.</font><br>
[Sat Nov 13 22:21:16 2004] : <B>Dorothea</B>: <font color='#000080'>Oh, I've got some ideas for what Renate's up to on that score.</font><br>
[Sat Nov 13 22:21:19 2004] : <B>Dorothea</B>: <font color='#000080'>And yes, that was one. :)</font><br>
[Sat Nov 13 22:21:32 2004] : <B>Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>Aryk let her Dorothy off easy; unfortunately, that was about all he could do.</font><br>
[Sat Nov 13 22:21:45 2004] : <B>Dorothea</B>: <font color='#000080'>The other one was trying to get in touch with Le Duc or his organization to see if they'll back her.</font><br>
[Sat Nov 13 22:21:48 2004] : <B>Dorothea</B>: <font color='#000080'>Especially financially.</font><br>
[Sat Nov 13 22:21:55 2004] : <B>Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>He's at least made it more difficult for her to interfere. She could probably bring a legal challenge against him, but it would be a legal tangle, too.</font><br>
[Sat Nov 13 22:21:58 2004] : <B>Dorothea</B>: <font color='#000080'>Because otherwise, she's going to have to take out a HUGE loan to get that temple built.</font><br>
[Sat Nov 13 22:22:19 2004] : <B>Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>Since the threats that sealed the contract weren't made in the Silver Coast, there's a whole jurisdiction thing, and it just gets worse from there.</font><br>
[Sat Nov 13 22:22:39 2004] : <B>Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>Yeah, exploring Le Duc's organization, and learning more about the mysteirous Soleil, are another possible plot branch.</font><br>
[Sat Nov 13 22:22:54 2004] : <B>Dorothea</B>: <font color='#000080'>Dorothy's very good at this, I must say.</font><br>
[Sat Nov 13 22:22:55 2004] : <B>Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>And even if you don't choose to make a major investigation part of the story, you'll keep running into his agents.</font><br>
[Sat Nov 13 22:23:07 2004] : <B>Dorothea</B>: <font color='#000080'>She tangled Renate all up in the law, and now she's done the same to Aryk.</font><br>
[Sat Nov 13 22:23:23 2004] : <B>Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>Well, she recognized Aryk, and knew he wouldn't kill her, so she didn't try to fight.</font><br>
[Sat Nov 13 22:23:32 2004] : <B>Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>Otherwise she might have been able to pull out some trick.</font><br>
[Sat Nov 13 22:23:43 2004] : <B>Dorothea</B>: <font color='#000080'>Heh. I'm looking forward to her next meeting with Renate. I truly am.</font><br>
[Sat Nov 13 22:23:50 2004] : <B>Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>She's probably steamed about the instrument, though. Good instruments run upwards of four silver.</font><br>
[Sat Nov 13 22:23:56 2004] : <B>Dorothea</B>: <font color='#000080'>at least!</font><br>
[Sat Nov 13 22:24:05 2004] : <B>Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>Well, wait until you find out what happened to the harp.</font><br>
[Sat Nov 13 22:24:16 2004] : <B>Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>Renate's sure to find out sooner or later.</font><br>
[Sat Nov 13 22:24:21 2004] : <B>Dorothea</B>: <font color='#000080'>heh</font><br>
[Sat Nov 13 22:24:27 2004] : <B>Dorothea</B>: <font color='#000080'>it's destroyed, isn't it?</font><br>
[Sat Nov 13 22:24:37 2004] : <B>Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>I can wait as long as it takes. Some day, you'll stumble into the right situation to find out.</font><br>
[Sat Nov 13 22:24:43 2004] : <B>Dorothea</B>: <font color='#000080'>:P</font><br>
[Sat Nov 13 22:25:15 2004] : <B>Dorothea</B>: <font color='#000080'>well, for what it's worth, before she left Ilium Renate was putting word out cautiously that she wanted to talk to Le Duc's people.</font><br>
[Sat Nov 13 22:25:28 2004] : <B>Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>Speaking of Lyria, your rediscovery of the temple was publicized in the papers, along with an interview with Lyria herself.</font><br>
[Sat Nov 13 22:25:37 2004] : <B>Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>So there's mindshare if you choose to exploit it within a short window.</font><br>
