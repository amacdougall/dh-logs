[Sat Jul 16 08:16:14 2011] : <b>(1737) Alan</b>: <font color='#612769'>I'm trying to figure out a strategy at work. We were talking about doing a major refactoring, i.e. a redesign of the program.</font><br />
[Sat Jul 16 08:16:44 2011] : <b>(1737) Alan</b>: <font color='#612769'>If you do it by <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Refactoring-Improving-Design-Existing-Code/dp/0201485672">the book</a>...</font><br />
[Sat Jul 16 08:16:58 2011] : <b>(1737) Alan</b>: <font color='#612769'>...you take tiny cautious steps that keep the program working at every stage.</font><br />
[Sat Jul 16 08:17:05 2011] : <b>(1737) Alan</b>: <font color='#612769'>That way if you make a mistake, you know exactly which step caused it.</font><br />
[Sat Jul 16 08:17:15 2011] : <b>(1737) Alan</b>: <font color='#612769'>And since the program always works, you can also pause to do bug fixes and stuff.</font><br />
[Sat Jul 16 08:17:46 2011] : <b>(1737) Alan</b>: <font color='#612769'>I explained all the benefits of this approach to my colleage/lead, and suggested he read a key chapter of the book, which we have on our shelves in response to a recent request by the Ruby guys.</font><br />
[Sat Jul 16 08:18:27 2011] : <b>(1737) Alan</b>: <font color='#612769'>Then at the end of the day, he pops up and says, "hey, I've got it almost working, just A, B, and C don't work, and we still have to do D through H, and I don't know which functionality is coming from where! But it's not bad for four hours' work!"</font><br />
[Sat Jul 16 08:19:00 2011] : <b>(1737) Alan</b>: <font color='#612769'>He basically copied vast amounts of code from one set of classes to another, and renamed some things, essentially doing dozens of steps at once.</font><br />
[Sat Jul 16 08:19:18 2011] : <b>(1737) Alan</b>: <font color='#612769'>And since it doesn't work now, there's no way to tell which of those dozens of steps is the problem.</font><br />
[Sat Jul 16 08:19:54 2011] : <b>(1735) Renate</b>: <font color='#000080'>have you played with any of the new testing frameworks out there?</font><br />
[Sat Jul 16 08:19:55 2011] : <b>(1737) Alan</b>: <font color='#612769'>And I can't just sit him down and explain the concept of refactoring again, because I already did before he sat down to do what he did.</font><br />
[Sat Jul 16 08:20:00 2011] : <b>(1735) Renate</b>: <font color='#000080'>I have a friend who raves about cucumber.</font><br />
[Sat Jul 16 08:20:15 2011] : <b>(1735) Renate</b>: <font color='#000080'>(that looked like a non sequitur, but I swear it wasn't!)</font><br />
[Sat Jul 16 08:20:33 2011] : <b>(1737) Alan</b>: <font color='#612769'>Sadly, none of them work well for what we're doing. We have a GUI which has complex Flash/Javascript interaction.</font><br />
[Sat Jul 16 08:20:42 2011] : <b>(1735) Renate</b>: <font color='#000080'>ah, too bad</font><br />
[Sat Jul 16 08:20:45 2011] : <b>(1737) Alan</b>: <font color='#612769'>There's no one input/output.</font><br />
[Sat Jul 16 08:21:00 2011] : <b>(1737) Alan</b>: <font color='#612769'>Which is all the more reason to take tiny steps we can test manually.</font><br />
[Sat Jul 16 08:21:26 2011] : <b>(1737) Alan</b>: <font color='#612769'>So we split up what our tasks will be... on Monday I guess I'll ask permission to take my part back to the beginning and do it the careful way.</font><br />
[Sat Jul 16 08:21:50 2011] : <b>(1737) Alan</b>: <font color='#612769'>Because right now, we're running a very real risk of just never getting this fixed, and/or having tons of regressions (i.e. iatrogenesis).</font><br />
[Sat Jul 16 08:21:57 2011] : <b>(1735) Renate</b>: <font color='#000080'>well, I don't think testing assumes one input/output</font><br />
[Sat Jul 16 08:22:04 2011] : <b>(1735) Renate</b>: <font color='#000080'>it's more of an "if X, then Y" thing</font><br />
[Sat Jul 16 08:23:37 2011] : <b>(1736) Aryk</b>: <font color='#800000'>Iatrogenesis.</font><br />
[Sat Jul 16 08:23:51 2011] : <b>(1737) Alan</b>: <font color='#612769'>Hm. Maybe there's a way of doing it. The big problem is that there are these real-time interactions between HTML controls and the Flash movie.</font><br />
[Sat Jul 16 08:24:16 2011] : <b>(1737) Alan</b>: <font color='#612769'>But maybe we can mock up the JSON calls and get a known end effect. I don't know.</font><br />
[Sat Jul 16 08:25:04 2011] : <b>(1737) Alan</b>: <font color='#612769'>Unit testing is far easier when it's stuff like, we pass in this object and we get back this other object. Instead of, we call this method and a visual effect occurs on the screen.</font><br />
