[Fri May 15 22:16:01 2009] : <b>(26819) Alan</b>: <font color='#000080'><hr /></font><br />
[Fri May 15 22:17:07 2009] : <b>(26819) Alan</b>: <font color='#000080'>The journal is written entirely in goblin; with the blessing of elven typesetting, even that language's crude stick-figure ideographs can look crisp and scientific, though hardly eloquent.</font><br />
[Fri May 15 22:17:59 2009] : <b>(26819) Alan</b>: <font color='#000080'>Tristan Laurent is aware that his enchanted glasses do not provide the most deft of translations, of course; but he sees no reason to expect that if he spoke the language himself, he would find it any more refined.</font><br />
[Fri May 15 22:19:15 2009] : <b>(26819) Alan</b>: <font color='#000080'>The journal, as translated by his glasses, is the Hobgoblins-Who-Use-Magic Science-of-all-Nations Book -- volume 14, issue 3, to be precise.</font><br />
[Fri May 15 22:20:37 2009] : <font color='#008000'>** (26815) Tristan Laurent <font color='#008000'>hmphs softly, "hobgoblin students of arcana aside indeed."</font> **</font><br />
[Fri May 15 22:21:04 2009] : <b>(26819) Alan</b>: <font color='#000080'>Of specific interest is an article summarizing, in the goblin language, the developments revealed in Laurent's latest paper; and especially, the interview which follows. The interview is not with High Master Laurent, of course; it is with one of his research assistants, Kenneth Raleigh.</font><br />
[Fri May 15 22:21:56 2009] : <b>(26819) Alan</b>: <font color='#000080'>The questions take a tone Laurent is not entirely accustomed to; cloaked in utmost sincerity and deference, the interviewer appears to be angling at very specific presuppositions.</font><br />
[Fri May 15 22:22:17 2009] : <b>(26819) Alan</b>: <font color='#000080'>"Would you tell us the name of your birth?" for example -- why would that be important in the slightest?</font><br />
[Fri May 15 22:22:37 2009] : <b>(26819) Alan</b>: <font color='#000080'>"Anoh Kensuke," is the answer.</font><br />
[Fri May 15 22:23:17 2009] : <b>(26819) Alan</b>: <font color='#000080'>"Why did you take on another name when you came to study magic?" Of course, the translation provided by the glasses is more like, "When studied magic you came to do, new name why taken?"</font><br />
[Fri May 15 22:24:07 2009] : <b>(26819) Alan</b>: <font color='#000080'>Shoddy artificing, the glasses translate the third-person deferential "Raleigh-san" to "you" but can't fix up the syntax.</font><br />
[Fri May 15 22:25:08 2009] : <b>(26819) Alan</b>: <font color='#000080'>"Of course, I am proud to be a goblin," the interviewee prevaricates, and continues in that vein for a few sentences, "but in order to fully immerse myself in the culture of magical study, I chose to take on a name that fit that world."</font><br />
[Fri May 15 22:25:57 2009] : <b>(26819) Alan</b>: <font color='#000080'>"Then why not a name in the language of your elven colleagues?"</font><br />
[Fri May 15 22:26:38 2009] : <b>(26819) Alan</b>: <font color='#000080'>An ellipsis masks a nervous laugh, followed an entire paragraph of conversational acrobatics amounting to, "That would be presumptuous."</font><br />
[Fri May 15 22:27:27 2009] : <b>(26819) Alan</b>: <font color='#000080'>"But the name 'Raleigh' is so difficult to pronounce..." says the interviewer.</font><br />
[Fri May 15 22:27:40 2009] : <b>(26819) Alan</b>: <font color='#000080'>"Yes, it was excellent practice."</font><br />
[Fri May 15 22:29:29 2009] : <b>(26819) Alan</b>: <font color='#000080'>Laurent can see why Alain brought this article to his attention. Raleigh did not choose the name; it was chosen for him as a sort of prank.</font><br />
[Fri May 15 22:30:27 2009] : <b>(26819) Alan</b>: <font color='#000080'>And the goblin took it in fine measure, and mastered his pronunciation, and all was well -- so why is this minor mage in a minor vulgar publication trying to get the goat of a graduate of the University?</font><br />
[Fri May 15 22:31:25 2009] : <b>(26819) Alan</b>: <font color='#000080'>But that is just the prelude: the rest of the interview attempts to pin down Raleigh's exact role in the authoring of the revolutionary article.</font><br />
[Fri May 15 22:31:50 2009] : <b>(26819) Alan</b>: <font color='#000080'>At first, of course, Raleigh insists that he was no more than a scrivener, a mere stenographer for the High Master's world-spanning wit.</font><br />
[Fri May 15 22:33:00 2009] : <font color='#008000'>** (26815) Tristan Laurent <font color='#008000'>mutters, "modesty, my dear Raleigh, will get you nowhere.  Why not speak of your contributions?"</font> **</font><br />
[Fri May 15 22:33:08 2009] : <b>(26819) Alan</b>: <font color='#000080'>But gradually admits, when pressed, that he also did some of the brute work of experiments and confirmations; and perhaps interpolated in cases where formulae were unclear; and so on, until to judge by this interview, he was one of the driving minds behind the entire enterprise.</font><br />
[Fri May 15 22:33:54 2009] : <b>(26819) Alan</b>: <font color='#000080'>The interviewer, at the last, demands to know: "Who was the first person ever to cast a purely mental spell under recorded conditions?"</font><br />
[Fri May 15 22:33:57 2009] : <font color='#008000'>** (26815) Tristan Laurent <font color='#008000'>smiles grimly, "there we are."</font> **</font><br />
[Fri May 15 22:35:46 2009] : <b>(26819) Alan</b>: <font color='#000080'>"That would be the High Master, beyond all doubt. You may ask any member of his team. For my own part, I have never managed to cast such a spell."</font><br />
[Fri May 15 22:36:40 2009] : <b>(26819) Alan</b>: <font color='#000080'>(Now here's where Adrian would have to decide what Laurent's personality is like. During the research process, he had reason to believe that mental spellcasting might actually damage the brain.)</font><br />
[Fri May 15 22:36:50 2009] : <b>(26819) Alan</b>: <font color='#000080'>(Would he have experimented on himself anyway?)</font><br />
[Fri May 15 22:38:18 2009] : <b>(26815) Tristan Laurent</b>: <font color='#003300'>(Yes.  He never hesitated to do it in the past, so why stop now?  Also, he has to lead the way.  He'll never inspire people if he lets them take the risks."</font><br />
[Fri May 15 22:38:54 2009] : <b>(26819) Alan</b>: <font color='#000080'>(In that case, the first part of Raleigh's answer is true, but the latter is still false: Laurent knows Raleigh is second only to him in mental magic.)</font><br />
[Fri May 15 22:40:01 2009] : <b>(26819) Alan</b>: <font color='#000080'>Raleigh begins to back down from the assertions the interviewer wrested from him, but -- gracelessly leaving Raleigh's attempted backpedaling in the printed article -- he brings it to a close.</font><br />
[Fri May 15 22:40:38 2009] : <b>(26815) Tristan Laurent</b>: <font color='#003300'>Tristan fully intends to seek Raleigh out and speak to him about the article.</font><br />
[Fri May 15 22:41:19 2009] : <b>(26819) Alan</b>: <font color='#000080'>Alain Marchand's note, attached with the copy of the article, said, "this publication's editorial voice has grown uncomfortably pointed. Candidate for investigation after the war."</font><br />
[Fri May 15 22:41:56 2009] : <b>(26819) Alan</b>: <font color='#000080'>Since the stunning victory at Heavenward Station, peace in the goblin lands has appeared well within reach.</font><br />

[Fri May 15 23:21:44 2009] : <b>(26819) Alan</b>: <font color='#000080'>Raleigh's mask slips; he's stunned. In fact, he reveals his original gameplan, unable to adapt quite in time: "I...

[Fri May 15 23:25:47 2009] : <b>(26819) Alan</b>: <font color='#000080'>The first in a string of golden moments for Noemi Fournier and Alexandre Rousseau, this battle consisted of a surprise attack on a "hardened position" at an old cablecar roost in the mountains of Maal.</font><br />
[Fri May 15 23:26:21 2009] : <b>(26819) Alan</b>: <font color='#000080'>The Horde doesn't like fortresses; instead, they fortify as they see fit, and raze the fortifications the moment a spot ceased to be valuable.</font><br />
[Fri May 15 23:26:58 2009] : <b>(26819) Alan</b>: <font color='#000080'>This mobile style of warfare suits them well, as flyers or runners, but makes them more vulnerable to swift strikes -- a perfect chance to show off the "swarm strike" tactic of Rousseau.</font><br />

[Fri May 15 23:29:16 2009] : <b>(26822) Noemi</b>: <font color='#710000'>Tristan wasn't the only one learning from the dragons, but she was far less vocal about it.</font><br />
[Fri May 15 23:29:58 2009] : <b>(26819) Alan</b>: <font color='#000080'>'motor' is a word that came much into use as more and more heavy magical artifacts were used in the war: A "motor" causes motion, just as a "rotor" causes rotation.

[Fri May 15 23:31:56 2009] : <b>(26819) Alan</b>: <font color='#000080'>With the newly built fortress hovering above Heavenward Station, the defense grid could be extended to cover the mines of Maal, which were captured one by one by the conventional army in clean battles.
