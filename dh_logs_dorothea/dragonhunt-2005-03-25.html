[Fri Mar 25 19:09:29 2005] : <B>Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>Log is on.</font><br>
[Fri Mar 25 19:10:14 2005] : <B>Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>"Well, that's a terrible exit line," Renate says, reaching for Aryk's hand.</font><br>
[Fri Mar 25 19:10:29 2005] : <B>Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>"Are you all right?"</font><br>
[Fri Mar 25 19:10:35 2005] : <font color='#008000'>** Aryk is quiet while he takes Renate's hand **</font><br>
[Fri Mar 25 19:10:57 2005] : <B>Aryk</B>: <font color='#000080'>"I'm scared.  But I'm... I have to go through this."</font><br>
[Fri Mar 25 19:11:41 2005] : <B>Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>"Nothing wrong with being scared. It's what you do in spite of being scared that counts. Look, Aryk... I actually think it's pretty simple. You want good for the world. Hold on to that, you'll be all right."</font><br>
[Fri Mar 25 19:11:43 2005] : <B>Alan</B>: <font color='#000080'>The gray-white marble halls of Red Palace stretch to infinity, red paper screens alternating with simple smooth pillars.</font><br>
[Fri Mar 25 19:12:19 2005] : <font color='#008000'>** Aryk turns to face Renate curiously.  He smiles a bit, then. **</font><br>
[Fri Mar 25 19:12:24 2005] : <B>Aryk</B>: <font color='#000080'>"You're right."</font><br>
[Fri Mar 25 19:12:24 2005] : <B>Alan</B>: <font color='#000080'>The capitals of the pillars are gargoyles, in a minor concession to demonology; but the tone of the desmesnes is formal and reserved.</font><br>
[Fri Mar 25 19:12:53 2005] : <B>Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>"And about truth -- nobody tells the whole truth. Nobody can. It's too big. So what the saint said -- it's true, in a way, but it's also true that some things the Church has told you are true."</font><br>
[Fri Mar 25 19:13:33 2005] : <B>Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>"And whatever truth you learn here, though it's liable to be incomplete, can only help you in the long run."</font><br>
[Fri Mar 25 19:13:26 2005] : <B>Aryk</B>: <font color='#000080'>"Yes.  It can't all be a lie.  I mean... it can't... can it?"</font><br>
[Fri Mar 25 19:13:43 2005] : <B>Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>"No, Aryk, no, I don't think so."</font><br>
[Fri Mar 25 19:13:56 2005] : <B>Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>"For one thing, what the saint told you was paradoxical, since he's a member of the Church himself."</font><br>
[Fri Mar 25 19:14:26 2005] : <B>Aryk</B>: <font color='#000080'>"Heh... " Aryk chuckles nervously, "I hope you're right"</font><br>
[Fri Mar 25 19:14:52 2005] : <B>Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>"So do I. So do I. Now, objectives: stay alive, stay together, and get through this. You with me on that?"</font><br>
[Fri Mar 25 19:15:50 2005] : <B>Alan</B>: <font color='#000080'>There's no way to get a sense of direction here; this high-ceilinged hall stretches out of sight to an arbitrary "north" and "south."</font><br>
[Fri Mar 25 19:16:17 2005] : <B>Aryk</B>: <font color='#000080'>Aryk figures forward is the way to go.  "Yes."  Aryk stops again and faces Renate.  "Thank you, Rennie.  Whatever... whatever we said to each other earlier... let's just forget it.  I mean... I forgive you."</font><br>
[Fri Mar 25 19:16:34 2005] : <B>Alan</B>: <font color='#000080'>The red paper screens are painted in subtle tones of earth and sepia with scenes of heroes, demons, and angels, of the First Age.</font><br>
[Fri Mar 25 19:16:55 2005] : <B>Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>The incredulous gratitude on her face is almost palpable. "Oh. Thank you."</font><br>
[Fri Mar 25 19:17:06 2005] : <B>Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>She squeezes his hand. "You lead, paladin."</font><br>
[Fri Mar 25 19:17:41 2005] : <B>Aryk</B>: <font color='#000080'>Aryk smiles warmly.  He looks up as he leads onward, examining the scenes on the paper screens warily.</font><br>
[Fri Mar 25 19:17:49 2005] : <B>Alan</B>: <font color='#000080'>There are intersections every hundred meters or so, leading to small hallways; though Red Palace may or may not be infinite in extent, it is varied in content.</font><br>
[Fri Mar 25 19:18:08 2005] : <B>Alan</B>: <font color='#000080'>One hallway leads to a corridor walled in fishtanks (or possibly windows onto a true ocean)...</font><br>
[Fri Mar 25 19:18:15 2005] : <B>Alan</B>: <font color='#000080'>One hallway leads into a gallery of sculptures.</font><br>
[Fri Mar 25 19:18:36 2005] : <B>Alan</B>: <font color='#000080'>One leads to steps which open onto an empty arena, dark stains on sand speaking of past battles.</font><br>
[Fri Mar 25 19:18:40 2005] : <font color='#008000'>** Renate is content to follow Aryk's lead. **</font><br>
[Fri Mar 25 19:18:56 2005] : <font color='#008000'>** Aryk only pauses a moment here and there to peek into the rooms from afar, but ultimately he continues forward **</font><br>
[Fri Mar 25 19:19:34 2005] : <B>Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>"You must miss Ricard," Renate observes quietly.</font><br>
[Fri Mar 25 19:20:01 2005] : <font color='#008000'>** Aryk simply nods.  There's some concern in his eyes. **</font><br>
[Fri Mar 25 19:19:36 2005] : <B>Aryk</B>: <font color='#000080'>"Sort of like... a lobby to big fancy inn... or a museum... only... well... not like that at all, I guess."</font><br>
[Fri Mar 25 19:19:49 2005] : <B>Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>"A king's hall."</font><br>
[Fri Mar 25 19:19:51 2005] : <B>Alan</B>: <font color='#000080'>There is only one directional cue here: a very occasional and almost instantaneous hissing noise, like a whip about to crack.</font><br>
[Fri Mar 25 19:20:06 2005] : <B>Aryk</B>: <font color='#000080'>"Do you hear that?"</font><br>
[Fri Mar 25 19:20:13 2005] : <B>Alan</B>: <font color='#000080'>It comes from far to the south, so far down the hall that vision grays out without a horizon to cut it off.</font><br>
[Fri Mar 25 19:20:20 2005] : <B>Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>"Yes. It's not close enough to duck; that's about all I can say. That direction."</font><br>
[Fri Mar 25 19:20:34 2005] : <B>Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>"Best lead we've got so far, I think."</font><br>
[Fri Mar 25 19:20:57 2005] : <font color='#008000'>** Aryk and Renate approach the source of the noise carefully **</font><br>
[Fri Mar 25 19:21:01 2005] : <B>Alan</B>: <font color='#000080'>Galleries off the main hall continue to display strange sights: a theater in which brass automata dance a slow and graceful ballet.</font><br>
[Fri Mar 25 19:21:47 2005] : <B>Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>Ordinarily Renate would stop to watch; now she is too keyed-up even to notice anything that isn't immediately pertinent -- or immediately lethal.</font><br>
[Fri Mar 25 19:21:39 2005] : <B>Alan</B>: <font color='#000080'>A dim, almost claustrophobic room full of man-high boxes with glowing windows and odd knobs on control panels.</font><br>
[Fri Mar 25 19:22:08 2005] : <B>Alan</B>: <font color='#000080'>An orrery writ in light, planets hovering in the air around the sun.</font><br>
[Fri Mar 25 19:22:38 2005] : <B>Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>"I wish I could tell where the light was coming from."</font><br>
[Fri Mar 25 19:22:45 2005] : <B>Alan</B>: <font color='#000080'>Time stands still here; though you walk a long time, you grow neither weary nor bored.</font><br>
[Fri Mar 25 19:23:11 2005] : <B>Alan</B>: <font color='#000080'>The light is directionless, yet not inhuman; instead, all is lit as if by steady lamplight.</font><br>
[Fri Mar 25 19:23:50 2005] : <B>Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>"You know, Aryk, I've always envied you the strength of your faith."</font><br>
[Fri Mar 25 19:24:05 2005] : <B>Alan</B>: <font color='#000080'>One gallery leads to a hall of windows onto what you suspect to be the true surface of the Demon World&#8212;a cracked black volcanic field, red light pulsing from crevasses and crystal pillars.</font><br>
[Fri Mar 25 19:25:03 2005] : <B>Aryk</B>: <font color='#000080'>"I wish I knew what the hell... er... what in the name of Michael all of those weird glowy boxes were.  Did you see that model of the planets?  You think it really looks like.... eh?  Oh... well, thank you.  I've... always admired your persistence.  Your sense of reason.  Your..."  Aryk's voice drops off as he peers into the last gallery.</font><br>
[Fri Mar 25 19:25:37 2005] : <B>Alan</B>: <font color='#000080'>To the south, a throne room of sorts comes into view; at least, as you squint, you can make out a dais only a single step above the floor level, with a simple high-backed wooden chair, uncarved and unfinished, in its center.</font><br>
[Fri Mar 25 19:25:40 2005] : <B>Alan</B>: <font color='#000080'>The chair is empty.</font><br>
[Fri Mar 25 19:25:40 2005] : <B>Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>Renate tugs him gently onward. "Walls of glass between us and... that. Come on."</font><br>
[Fri Mar 25 19:25:46 2005] : <B>Aryk</B>: <font color='#000080'>"...That place..."</font><br>
[Fri Mar 25 19:26:02 2005] : <B>Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>"I know. It's all right."</font><br>
[Fri Mar 25 19:26:04 2005] : <B>Alan</B>: <font color='#000080'>The whipping noise is close now; it comes from south and a bit to the left, from one of the galleries right before the throne room.</font><br>
[Fri Mar 25 19:26:06 2005] : <B>Aryk</B>: <font color='#000080'>"...Yeah... let's move on."</font><br>
[Fri Mar 25 19:26:25 2005] : <B>Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>"Shhhh. Quietly."</font><br>
[Fri Mar 25 19:26:34 2005] : <B>Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>Unconsciously, Renate goes up on tiptoe.</font><br>
[Fri Mar 25 19:27:03 2005] : <font color='#008000'>** Aryk adds more determination to his pace as he leads on toward the noise.  Once close, the instinct to creep also overtakes him. **</font><br>
[Fri Mar 25 19:27:15 2005] : <B>Alan</B>: <font color='#000080'>This gallery is a training hall, like any dojo in Southtown. A padded canvas mat, woven grass floor-mats, racks of wooden weapons.</font><br>
[Fri Mar 25 19:28:26 2005] : <B>Alan</B>: <font color='#000080'>A man stands at one end of the ring, facing you. He is dressed only in a white hakama; tousled black hair almost hides his eyes.</font><br>
[Fri Mar 25 19:28:47 2005] : <B>Alan</B>: <font color='#000080'>His skin is dark red; his eyes are black; though he gazes in your general direction, he doesn't focus on you.</font><br>
[Fri Mar 25 19:29:16 2005] : <B>Alan</B>: <font color='#000080'>A straw-bale target dummy, like those used for sword practice everywhere, drops from nowhere to land on the mat.</font><br>
[Fri Mar 25 19:29:29 2005] : <font color='#008000'>** Aryk stops in his tracks **</font><br>
[Fri Mar 25 19:29:36 2005] : <B>Alan</B>: <font color='#000080'>It immediately begins to move around, so quickly your eye can barely follow it, like the shell in a charlatan's ruse.</font><br>
[Fri Mar 25 19:30:04 2005] : <B>Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>"It may not be what it appears," Renate cautions him softly.</font><br>
[Fri Mar 25 19:30:04 2005] : <B>Alan</B>: <font color='#000080'>The whipping noise sounds again, and the red-skinned man seems to shrug slightly.</font><br>
[Fri Mar 25 19:30:29 2005] : <B>Alan</B>: <font color='#000080'>As the bale falls apart into a flurry of slashed straw, you realize that he is in fact returning from an attack.</font><br>
[Fri Mar 25 19:30:38 2005] : <font color='#008000'>** Aryk nods but nonetheless tries his best to follow the training dummy and the man with his eyes **</font><br>
[Fri Mar 25 19:30:52 2005] : <B>Aryk</B>: <font color='#000080'>"..."</font><br>
[Fri Mar 25 19:30:57 2005] : <B>Alan</B>: <font color='#000080'>"This," he says, "is considerably harder than it looks."</font><br>
[Fri Mar 25 19:31:06 2005] : <B>Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>"Not bad," Renate murmurs. "Faster than Rien, even."</font><br>
[Fri Mar 25 19:31:21 2005] : <B>Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>"I believe you, sir," she says aloud, politely.</font><br>
[Fri Mar 25 19:31:30 2005] : <B>Alan</B>: <font color='#000080'>"You might think, 'oh, he makes the rules here, he can do anything.' You'd be right. But of course that's cheating."</font><br>
[Fri Mar 25 19:31:49 2005] : <B>Aryk</B>: <font color='#000080'>"Hah.  I can top... that."</font><br>
[Fri Mar 25 19:31:55 2005] : <B>Alan</B>: <font color='#000080'>"And who likes cheaters? Nobody. But who defines cheating? That's where the philosophizing begins."</font><br>
[Fri Mar 25 19:32:27 2005] : <B>Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>"Twisting the rules is frequently the most effective way to cheat."</font><br>
[Fri Mar 25 19:32:31 2005] : <B>Alan</B>: <font color='#000080'>"You don't detect me as a demon, by the way, because I make the rules here. And I'd just as soon we talk man to man."</font><br>
[Fri Mar 25 19:32:41 2005] : <B>Alan</B>: <font color='#000080'>"Case in point," he adds, nodding at Renate.</font><br>
[Fri Mar 25 19:32:51 2005] : <B>Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>"Hmph."</font><br>
[Fri Mar 25 19:33:11 2005] : <B>Aryk</B>: <font color='#000080'>"That's fine.  I'd rather not get into a fight in a pocket dimension of someone else's creation, anyway."</font><br>
[Fri Mar 25 19:33:16 2005] : <B>Alan</B>: <font color='#000080'>"First things first. I'm Kahan. I know who you are, and pleasantries would be ironic at best anyway."</font><br>
[Fri Mar 25 19:33:39 2005] : <font color='#008000'>** Renate raises one blonde eyebrow in an otherwise motionless face. **</font><br>
[Fri Mar 25 19:33:45 2005] : <B>Aryk</B>: <font color='#000080'>".... eh..."</font><br>
[Fri Mar 25 19:33:51 2005] : <B>Alan</B>: <font color='#000080'>"You're in the Demon World, in Red Palace. It's a 'realm' of the Demon World -- if you don't know how that works, I'll explain later -- but it's the real deal."</font><br>
[Fri Mar 25 19:33:55 2005] : <font color='#008000'>** Aryk involuntarily takes a step back. **</font><br>
[Fri Mar 25 19:34:18 2005] : <font color='#008000'>** Renate follows him, somehow managing to make the clumsy retreat look like a dance-step. **</font><br>
[Fri Mar 25 19:34:28 2005] : <B>Alan</B>: <font color='#000080'>"You may have seen some of the windows out into the surface. Trust me, it's all a psychological vision."</font><br>
[Fri Mar 25 19:34:39 2005] : <B>Alan</B>: <font color='#000080'>"Just like all the crystalline water and glowing parrots up in the Sacred Realm."</font><br>
[Fri Mar 25 19:34:58 2005] : <B>Alan</B>: <font color='#000080'>"None of it's real, on either side. We just give the public what they want. Heh, not to be cynical."</font><br>
[Fri Mar 25 19:35:10 2005] : <B>Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>"What they want, or what you want them to want?"</font><br>
[Fri Mar 25 19:35:16 2005] : <B>Alan</B>: <font color='#000080'>"Better to say that if outside this palace were a beautiful evergreen forest... would it make you feel any better about demons?"</font><br>
[Fri Mar 25 19:35:18 2005] : <B>Alan</B>: <font color='#000080'>"Probably not."</font><br>
[Fri Mar 25 19:35:26 2005] : <B>Aryk</B>: <font color='#000080'>"Just hold on!  How.... h-how do I know you speak the truth?  How do I know you are who you say you are?"</font><br>
[Fri Mar 25 19:35:39 2005] : <B>Alan</B>: <font color='#000080'>"Do you actually doubt me, Sir Aryk?"</font><br>
[Fri Mar 25 19:36:34 2005] : <B>Aryk</B>: <font color='#000080'>"In this place I'll doubt just about anything I see.  Besides, how do I know you aren't a fy-lo-softical psycho vision too?"</font><br>
[Fri Mar 25 19:37:02 2005] : <B>Alan</B>: <font color='#000080'>"You don't." Kahan (if he really is) shrugs helplessly.</font><br>
[Fri Mar 25 19:37:16 2005] : <B>Aryk</B>: <font color='#000080'>"...Ah.  Right you are, then."</font><br>
[Fri Mar 25 19:37:41 2005] : <B>Alan</B>: <font color='#000080'>"Sometimes you just have to take someone's word. Who am I, Ghoster? I don't lie."</font><br>
[Fri Mar 25 19:38:09 2005] : <B>Alan</B>: <font color='#000080'>"Someone who's pretending to be me could lie all day. No way of telling the difference."</font><br>
[Fri Mar 25 19:38:17 2005] : <B>Alan</B>: <font color='#000080'>"I could say 'ask me something only Kahan would know.'"</font><br>
[Fri Mar 25 19:38:25 2005] : <B>Alan</B>: <font color='#000080'>Kahan grins.</font><br>
[Fri Mar 25 19:38:39 2005] : <B>Alan</B>: <font color='#000080'>"But if only I knew it, how would you?"</font><br>
[Fri Mar 25 19:38:54 2005] : <B>Aryk</B>: <font color='#000080'>Aryk thinks, then shakes his head.  "This is crap!  If you're Kahan, why are you speaking to me?"</font><br>
[Fri Mar 25 19:39:10 2005] : <B>Aryk</B>: <font color='#000080'>"Why don't you just banish me to some fiery pit?!"</font><br>
[Fri Mar 25 19:39:11 2005] : <B>Alan</B>: <font color='#000080'>"I admire your willingness to start with first principles, though. So why not postulate that I'm Kahan, and then I'll explain what you're doing here."</font><br>
[Fri Mar 25 19:39:30 2005] : <font color='#008000'>** Renate opens her mouth, then closes it, having been about to make the same remark. **</font><br>
[Fri Mar 25 19:39:47 2005] : <B>Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>She catches Aryk's eye and nods fractionally.</font><br>
[Fri Mar 25 19:40:25 2005] : <B>Aryk</B>: <font color='#000080'>"Fine.  So...'Kahan'... what's crackin'?"</font><br>
[Fri Mar 25 19:40:37 2005] : <font color='#008000'>** Aryk folds his arms skeptically **</font><br>
[Fri Mar 25 19:40:50 2005] : <B>Alan</B>: <font color='#000080'>"You're here because the Church once saw promise in you, but now thinks that promise is running out. They think you're an incorrigible loose cannon who can't follow orders, has no fixed morality, and cheerfully reinterprets events to keep himself on the side of good no matter what happens."</font><br>
[Fri Mar 25 19:40:53 2005] : <font color='#008000'>** Renate slips her hand into his elbow. **</font><br>
[Fri Mar 25 19:41:24 2005] : <B>Alan</B>: <font color='#000080'>"They send people to me because they hope I'll turn them to my side, thus giving them some opponents they can actually kill for a change."</font><br>
[Fri Mar 25 19:41:58 2005] : <B>Alan</B>: <font color='#000080'>"I got wise to that centuries ago, though. I'm not convinced you're Kahanite material. For one thing, you can't rap."</font><br>
[Fri Mar 25 19:42:27 2005] : <B>Aryk</B>: <font color='#000080'>"That's.... I.... Fuck you!"  Aryk balls up his fist.</font><br>
[Fri Mar 25 19:42:38 2005] : <B>Alan</B>: <font color='#000080'>"For another, you're lousy with the comebacks."</font><br>
[Fri Mar 25 19:42:50 2005] : <B>Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>"Aryk," Renate says, calmly. "Language. And temper. Don't prove him right."</font><br>
[Fri Mar 25 19:43:05 2005] : <B>Alan</B>: <font color='#000080'>"Finally, you let women boss you around."</font><br>
[Fri Mar 25 19:43:43 2005] : <B>Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>"Mm. Terrible thing, that, indeed."</font><br>
[Fri Mar 25 19:43:14 2005] : <B>Aryk</B>: <font color='#000080'>"Language, Rennie?  Did you forget where we are?"</font><br>

[Fri Mar 25 20:17:26 2005] : <B>Alan</B>: <font color='#000080'>"Ah, see, that's the other thing... you can have different aspects of your church, as long as the core beliefs and attitudes are the same."</font><br>
[Fri Mar 25 20:18:07 2005] : <B>Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>"So Kahanites can rescue treed kittens, and other Kahanites can, I don't know, set fire to the trees and eat the kittens."</font><br>
[Fri Mar 25 20:18:11 2005] : <B>Alan</B>: <font color='#000080'>"I know how Michael does things. He's got those Black Shield guys forming neighborhood watches against roving mutants or whatever... then the other side of the same coin is your Northrock paladins wandering around to every bakery saying 'DEMONIC doughnuts?'"</font><br>
[Fri Mar 25 20:19:10 2005] : <B>Aryk</B>: <font color='#000080'>"I choose not to take that on personally.  The church is 'more or less setting me loose.'  Well, that's fine."...</font><br>
[Fri Mar 25 20:20:26 2005] : <B>Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>"The question, Aryk," Renate says, steady as ever, "has less to do with you, Lord Michael, or Lord Kahan, than the nature of their respective organizations. Do you truly believe it does not matter that your fellows in faith, should you league with Lord Kahan here, will be engaged in what you would consider abomination?"</font><br>
[Fri Mar 25 20:21:11 2005] : <B>Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>"And is Lord Kahan's offered freedom worth more to you than Lord Michael's aims, however imperfectly realized?"</font><br>
[Fri Mar 25 20:21:51 2005] : <B>Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>"Admitting, of course, that perfection among humans is an impossibility to begin with; it is somewhat unjust to attack the Church on that score."</font><br>
[Fri Mar 25 20:22:06 2005] : <B>Aryk</B>: <font color='#000080'>"The Church is holding me back.  I was brought up learning you, Kahan, are the enemy.  I went out unto the world, and found out that your worshippers served coffee and saved villages.  Instead of feeling conflicted, I became what I am now.  A lone paladin, who loves and obeys Michael, not because they church says so, because I SAY SO."</font><br>
[Fri Mar 25 20:23:17 2005] : <B>Aryk</B>: <font color='#000080'>"Does that make me a heretic?  Who knows.  If it does, whatever."</font><br>

[Fri Mar 25 20:24:26 2005] : <B>Aryk</B>: <font color='#000080'>"I will not forget what the church has done to me, I will not blame them for their faults.  I will move on, do what is right, and if a Kahanite gets in my way, I will kill him.  If a Kahanite serves me coffee, and it is good, I will give him a gracious tip."</font><br>

[Fri Mar 25 20:26:57 2005] : <B>Alan</B>: <font color='#000080'>"I've already told Michael to batten down his hatches. I don't know if he believed me."</font><br>

[Fri Mar 25 20:28:01 2005] : <B>Alan</B>: <font color='#000080'>"The question now is still this, though: Are you following your own code or someone else's?"</font><br>

[Fri Mar 25 20:28:40 2005] : <B>Alan</B>: <font color='#000080'>Kahan shrugs. "I can't convince you what game I'm playing. You'll have to insinuate your own inferences."</font><br>

[Fri Mar 25 20:30:17 2005] : <B>Alan</B>: <font color='#000080'>"Perhaps you've heard this paradox before, and already come up with a crisp debunkation:"</font><br>
[Fri Mar 25 20:30:36 2005] : <B>Alan</B>: <font color='#000080'>"Isn't the generosity of someone who has no external reason for it more valuable than the generosity of someone sworn to it?"</font><br>

[Fri Mar 25 20:33:22 2005] : <B>Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>"It is all interconnected," Renate says, and suddenly she has begun to look tired. "To be governed solely by one's own will is to be a blinkered horse, a child with its hands over its ears. We have to choose our associates and our reasons for associating with them."</font><br>

[Fri Mar 25 20:44:20 2005] : <B>Alan</B>: <font color='#000080'>"Well, my point exactly. I would argue, and Lady Renate would disagree, that each individual code, as long as it's the product of self-examination and trial, as valid."</font><br>
[Fri Mar 25 20:46:01 2005] : <B>Aryk</B>: <font color='#000080'>"I won't lie.  I desire more paladins to think as I do.  I can see the good I could bring if I branched off from the church.  But a good man once told me that I have to be careful when utilizing power.  I don't think it's my role to do that sort of thing.  If the Sacred Alliance wants my help, I will offer it."</font><br>
[Fri Mar 25 20:47:03 2005] : <B>Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>"Well, I'm no theologian, but I think the official line is more that Good is indeed singular, but not necessarily well-grasped.

[Fri Mar 25 21:00:44 2005] : <B>Alan</B>: <font color='#000080'>Kahan's silent for a moment. "Hm. Seems the Ghost's ignoring me. Those two wouldn't happen to have a history, would they?"</font><br>

[Fri Mar 25 21:02:04 2005] : <B>Alan</B>: <font color='#000080'>"Doesn't really matter if that's what was said, specifically, anyway. Ghoster tends to reinterpret things. A lot."</font><br>
