[Fri Sep 14 20:53:08 2007] : <b>(367) Rien</b>: <font color='#4a4a00'>Sashi is clearly confused by this question as well.  Her instincts tell her to Fade and try to get away, but something tells her that, with this strange blind woman, the shaggy red man next to her, and the other blind person on her other side, such a thing would be a bad idea.</font><br />
[Fri Sep 14 20:53:38 2007] : <b>(367) Rien</b>: <font color='#4a4a00'>Rien, for his part, is watching Sashi curiously, his blank eyes following every movement of her hands.</font><br />

[Fri Sep 14 21:01:25 2007] : <b>(370) Aryk</b>: <font color='#710000'>Aryk comes back over and puts a glass of room-temperature apple juice before her.  "I knew they were too cheap here to make scumble with whole apples."</font><br />

[Fri Sep 14 21:16:46 2007] : <b>(371) Renate</b>: <font color='#000080'>"I have seen no evidence she has committed a crime," Renate answers frostily.</font><br />
[Fri Sep 14 21:17:13 2007] : <b>(371) Renate</b>: <font color='#000080'>"And you lot look like a lynch mob."</font><br />
[Fri Sep 14 21:17:29 2007] : <b>(370) Aryk</b>: <font color='#710000'>"Well, we sure have!  She's gonna pay, alright, for what she's done!"</font><br />
[Fri Sep 14 21:18:16 2007] : <b>(371) Renate</b>: <font color='#000080'>"Fifteen men, on a lone girl? That doesn't look like justice to me. I don't even want to say what it <em>does</em> look like."</font><br />
[Fri Sep 14 21:19:02 2007] : <b>(370) Aryk</b>: <font color='#710000'>Another man shouts, "She's like an animal, that one!  You don't know what she's capable of!  You're best of leavin' her to us!"</font><br />
[Fri Sep 14 21:19:29 2007] : <b>(367) Rien</b>: <font color='#4a4a00'>Sashi is on her feet quickly, weapons in her hands.  A dagger the length of her forearm, hook-pointed on the tip and serrated down the edge is hand in a backhand grip, laid back against her arm.  Her other hand is wrapped around the cross-ways hilt of a punch-dagger.</font><br />
[Fri Sep 14 21:19:44 2007] : <b>(371) Renate</b>: <font color='#000080'>"Oh, I am, am I? Sashi, don't. Put those away."</font><br />
[Fri Sep 14 21:19:54 2007] : <b>(370) Aryk</b>: <font color='#710000'>Aryk sighs.  He stands, and walks over with his hand tucked behind him to the bartender.  "RING OF FIRE!"  The two of them disappear in a burst of flame, as the mob is taken completely aback.</font><br />
[Fri Sep 14 21:20:34 2007] : <b>(371) Renate</b>: <font color='#000080'>"That's one," Renate says coolly. "How many more?"</font><br />
[Fri Sep 14 21:21:25 2007] : <b>(367) Rien</b>: <font color='#4a4a00'>Sashi flips forward suddenly, bapancing on the tips of her weapons.  Her feet kick back and up, catching the man creeping up behind them solidly on the chin, throwing him back.</font><br />
[Fri Sep 14 21:21:37 2007] : <b>(367) Rien</b>: <font color='#4a4a00'>(balancing*)</font><br />
[Fri Sep 14 21:21:52 2007] : <b>(371) Renate</b>: <font color='#000080'>"Two. Rien, your turn."</font><br />
[Fri Sep 14 21:23:42 2007] : <b>(370) Aryk</b>: <font color='#710000'>Two of the men charge in madly from the front doorway, probably out o desperation.</font><br />
[Fri Sep 14 21:23:44 2007] : <b>(367) Rien</b>: <font color='#4a4a00'>The muggy air turns dry and cold suddenly as Rien summons his sword.  Wind whips around him, sending his hair flying, white fire streaming from his eyes.  The blast of air the issues from his sword catching the man who demanded they hand over Sashi and flinging him into the roofing beams.</font><br />
[Fri Sep 14 21:24:28 2007] : <b>(370) Aryk</b>: <font color='#710000'>Others toward the back of the mob turn and run at the sight of the speaker being tossed around like a rag doll.</font><br />
[Fri Sep 14 21:24:45 2007] : <b>(370) Aryk</b>: <font color='#710000'>One of the chargers is ballsy enough to come right for Renate.</font><br />
[Fri Sep 14 21:26:49 2007] : <b>(370) Aryk</b>: <font color='#710000'>Her speed, of course, far outweighs him, a heavy-set man wieldin what looks to be a chair-leg.</font><br />
[Fri Sep 14 21:27:08 2007] : <b>(371) Renate</b>: <font color='#000080'>Renate sidesteps him neatly and lets him trip over a table-leg.</font><br />
[Fri Sep 14 21:27:11 2007] : <b>(367) Rien</b>: <font color='#4a4a00'>(With obligatory rusty nails in it, I hope.)</font><br />
[Fri Sep 14 21:27:20 2007] : <b>(371) Renate</b>: <font color='#000080'>(Owie.)</font><br />
[Fri Sep 14 21:29:56 2007] : <b>(367) Rien</b>: <font color='#4a4a00'>Sashi turns back to the mob.  Her face is perfectly calm and blank, and her weapons are held in a ready stance, the katar glowing with a poisonous green-yellow light, the katar's blade dark purple and smoking.</font><br />
[Fri Sep 14 21:30:20 2007] : <b>(371) Renate</b>: <font color='#000080'>"Well," Renate says. "That's unusual."</font><br />
[Fri Sep 14 21:30:44 2007] : <b>(370) Aryk</b>: <font color='#710000'>Another burst of flame appears and Aryk filps a few copper into the air before catching it and putting it in his satchel.  The bartender is out cold.  The mob, or what's left, leaves rather quickly than they came in.  Except one.  The crazed man comes in from the back door, and meets eyes with Sashi, a rapier held casually at his side.</font><br />
[Fri Sep 14 21:31:18 2007] : <b>(370) Aryk</b>: <font color='#710000'>"A disciple of Jinglespiff, maybe?" Aryk jests, watching Sashi with interest.</font><br />
[Fri Sep 14 21:31:48 2007] : <b>(370) Aryk</b>: <font color='#710000'>The crazed man says, "Ooh, girlie, wanna have a whirlie?"</font><br />
[Fri Sep 14 21:32:08 2007] : <b>(371) Renate</b>: <font color='#000080'>"That's disgusting," Renate says. "Sashi, you just come over here and leave him be."</font><br />
[Fri Sep 14 21:32:51 2007] : <b>(367) Rien</b>: <font color='#4a4a00'>Sashi waits, still and calm as he comes towards her.  She ducks under his slash, rising again, dragging the hooked tip of her dagger up his belly and across his chest.  The flesh sizzles, eating away from the edges of the wound, like her blade was made of acid.</font><br />
[Fri Sep 14 21:35:07 2007] : <b>(370) Aryk</b>: <font color='#710000'>The crazed man staggers backward, his laugh cut abrupt by the pain.  Aryk suddenly spins around.  "Hey, guys...?!"</font><br />
[Fri Sep 14 21:35:26 2007] : <b>(371) Renate</b>: <font color='#000080'>"Sashi, don't!" Renate somersaults forward, coming upright and grabbing Sashi away. "No killing."</font><br />
[Fri Sep 14 21:36:58 2007] : <b>(370) Aryk</b>: <font color='#710000'>Then it's the man's turn.  He goes into a stance, and his sword, spiraling before him, creates a ring of fire that he casts forward, which now unfortuanately could hit both Sashi and Renate.</font><br />
[Fri Sep 14 21:38:09 2007] : <b>(371) Renate</b>: <font color='#000080'>Renate leaps into the air to arc over it, her sword coming out of its sheath in midair.</font><br />
[Fri Sep 14 21:38:37 2007] : <b>(370) Aryk</b>: <font color='#710000'>"It's a dragon style!  One of those crazy-named ones!" Aryk shouts.</font><br />
[Fri Sep 14 21:39:28 2007] : <b>(370) Aryk</b>: <font color='#710000'>The ring only singes the bottoms of Renate's shoes, but he returns the favor to Sashi at least somewhat by scorching her arms.</font><br />
[Fri Sep 14 21:40:01 2007] : <b>(371) Renate</b>: <font color='#000080'>"You," Renate growls. "Back off, get out. Now. Last warning."</font><br />
[Fri Sep 14 21:41:07 2007] : <b>(367) Rien</b>: <font color='#4a4a00'>Sashi goes low, her lip peeling back in a silent snarl.  She rolls forward, one leg spining out to sweep the man's legs out from under him.</font><br />
[Fri Sep 14 21:43:02 2007] : <b>(370) Aryk</b>: <font color='#710000'>Sashi's roll taxes her impossibly right under Renate's legs.  The man, on hand clutching his stomach, is either too crazy or too busy to heed Renate's warning.  He evades Sashi's trip-up by hopping up, planting a foot on the doorway, and leaping over both of the girls entirel, his body turning in mid air gracefully.  He lands right beside Aryk.</font><br />
[Fri Sep 14 21:43:27 2007] : <b>(370) Aryk</b>: <font color='#710000'>"Whoa!"  Says Aryk taking a few steps back, drawing his blade.</font><br />
[Fri Sep 14 21:44:06 2007] : <b>(371) Renate</b>: <font color='#000080'>"Are you badly hurt, Miss Sashi?" Renate asks.</font><br />
[Fri Sep 14 21:45:20 2007] : <b>(367) Rien</b>: <font color='#4a4a00'>Sashi, quick as lightning, follows his move, but lands instead on the crazed man's back, her strong legs hooking through his arms, yanking them back.  She pulls his head back by the chin, her dagger, no longer purple or smoking, resting against his throat.</font><br />
[Fri Sep 14 21:46:34 2007] : <b>(371) Renate</b>: <font color='#000080'>"Sashi! No!"</font><br />
[Fri Sep 14 21:46:54 2007] : <b>(371) Renate</b>: <font color='#000080'>Renate throws all the command she has into her voice.</font><br />
[Fri Sep 14 21:47:20 2007] : <b>(371) Renate</b>: <font color='#000080'>"We don't kill, you and I. Let him go, now."</font><br />
[Fri Sep 14 21:48:36 2007] : <b>(367) Rien</b>: <font color='#4a4a00'>Sashi hesitates for all of a second, before unwinding her legs, and clubbing the man solidly on the temple with the heavy pommel of her dagger, knocking him unconcious.</font><br />
[Fri Sep 14 21:49:37 2007] : <b>(370) Aryk</b>: <font color='#710000'>The man goes limp.  Aryk sighs with relief.  "Thank god for that.  That was that dragon style that makes you more powerful the more damage you take.  He was just gettin' ready to smite somebody, I know it."</font><br />
[Fri Sep 14 21:50:09 2007] : <b>(370) Aryk</b>: <font color='#710000'>"Speaking of smiting, this chick is spooky.  And this bar sucks.  I hate the Patchworks."  Aryk exits.</font><br />
[Fri Sep 14 21:51:06 2007] : <b>(371) Renate</b>: <font color='#000080'>Renate releases a held breath. "Thank you, Sashi."</font><br />
[Fri Sep 14 21:51:10 2007] : <b>(367) Rien</b>: <font color='#4a4a00'>Renate picked up a momentary flare of flat, dead rage from sashi at the mention of the word 'Dragon'.</font><br />
[Fri Sep 14 21:52:16 2007] : <b>(371) Renate</b>: <font color='#000080'>"I think I share Aryk's opinions, for the most part. Shall we go outside into clearer air?"</font><br />
[Fri Sep 14 21:52:55 2007] : <b>(371) Renate</b>: <font color='#000080'><hr></font><br />
[Fri Sep 14 21:53:03 2007] : <b>(371) Renate</b>: <font color='#000080'>Thanks! That was fun.</font><br />
[Fri Sep 14 21:53:28 2007] : <b>(371) Renate</b>: <font color='#000080'>But I seem to be picking up a cold, so I'm going to take it to bed.</font><br />
[Fri Sep 14 21:53:57 2007] : <b>(367) Rien</b>: <font color='#4a4a00'>No problems.  I'm glad I finally got her introduced.</font><br />
[Fri Sep 14 21:54:07 2007] : <b>(371) Renate</b>: <font color='#000080'>'night all!</font><br />
[Fri Sep 14 21:54:13 2007] : <b>(367) Rien</b>: <font color='#4a4a00'>I should go mark assignments, or else people will be Not Happy with me</font><br />
[Fri Sep 14 21:54:15 2007] : <b>(367) Rien</b>: <font color='#4a4a00'>'night, D.</font><br />
