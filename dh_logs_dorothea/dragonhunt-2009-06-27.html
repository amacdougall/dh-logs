[Sat Jun 27 01:11:22 2009] : <b>(94) Alan</b>: <font color='#000080'>Rousseau's army continues its maneuver, but two elves carry St. Lucien's burned body back to his own lines; but no priests have the power to resurrect it, for it is burned nearly to bones.</font><br />
[Sat Jun 27 01:12:45 2009] : <b>(94) Alan</b>: <font color='#000080'>Rousseau fights with renewed ferocity, but before he and Noemi have destroyed more than a sixth of the enemy armada, they are forced to defend the lighthouse: the dragons don't like superweapons any more than the elves do.</font><br />
[Sat Jun 27 01:13:46 2009] : <b>(94) Alan</b>: <font color='#000080'>A portal shot; then another; Noemi's aim improves. There's a sense of power to it, a tidiness that has been lacking in the war so far: point at a dragon, pull the lever, it goes away.</font><br />
[Sat Jun 27 01:14:32 2009] : <b>(94) Alan</b>: <font color='#000080'>Black Iron and Winter Sol left early; they must have seen Gildenspire's fate and known which side their bread was buttered on.</font><br />

[Sat Jun 27 01:16:55 2009] : <b>(94) Alan</b>: <font color='#000080'>Battle concludes with sundown; the dragons came out the worse, but this time, Rousseau's plans will win no easy victory.</font><br />
[Sat Jun 27 01:18:18 2009] : <b>(94) Alan</b>: <font color='#000080'>And during the night, the dragon armada retreats; spotters say they're sailing south, to attack at another point on the archipelago, one much less advantageous but also one not covered by a portal cannon.</font><br />
