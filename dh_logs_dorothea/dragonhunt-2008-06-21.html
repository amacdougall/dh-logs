[Sat Jun 21 12:08:19 2008] : <b>(10033) Renate</b>: <font color='#000080'>guess we'll see!</font><br />
[Sat Jun 21 12:08:27 2008] : <b>(10037) Aryk</b>: <font color='#710000'>Well, hate all of us, considering that most people consider Rien and especially Renate particularly responsible for his "change"</font><br />
[Sat Jun 21 12:09:05 2008] : <b>(10033) Renate</b>: <font color='#000080'>you can't throw Ren off with a heckler</font><br />
[Sat Jun 21 12:09:13 2008] : <b>(10033) Renate</b>: <font color='#000080'>not a chance</font><br />
