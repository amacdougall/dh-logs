[Fri Jul 28 20:10:21 2006] : <B>(2) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>As Rien enters the Mirror Realm, true to Ricard's comment, he catches a fleeting glimpse of a different set of surroundings... a different ravine, curving in a different direction, almost a mirror image of the one you are in.</font><br>
[Fri Jul 28 20:10:40 2006] : <B>(3) Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>"Hm. That suggests... I wonder if someone else is watching?" Renate calms her mind, blocks out Aryk and Rien as much as she can, reaches for any other impression, however distant or fleeting.</font><br>

[Fri Jul 28 20:16:54 2006] : <B>(2) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>Rien has evidently realized that the current illusion is simple: you just think you're facing in the opposite direction.</font><br>
[Fri Jul 28 20:17:12 2006] : <B>(2) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>You stroll "down" the ravine without the slightest complication.</font><br>
[Fri Jul 28 20:18:31 2006] : <B>(2) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>After about five minutes of brisk walking, you realize that you have, in fact, been ascending the entire time; and just as the ravine narrows to an impenetrable cleft, there is an iron ladder bolted to the stone, leading up to the left.</font><br>

[Fri Jul 28 20:21:01 2006] : <B>(2) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>You can remember climbing up through this area, but you definitely didn't see a ladder the first time.</font><br>

[Fri Jul 28 22:33:06 2006] : <B>(3) Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>"I'm sorry; I know this has been a dreadfully uncomfortable trip for you."</font><br>
[Fri Jul 28 22:33:13 2006] : <B>(2) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>(Anything in particular you folks would like to chat about? I can just be available for NPC small talk; it's probably a bit late to bring Forengil in anyway, but trust that he'll come with hooks to the main subquest.)</font><br>
[Fri Jul 28 22:33:29 2006] : <B>(3) Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>(Not really, no.)</font><br>
[Fri Jul 28 22:33:59 2006] : <B>(2) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>(The main subquest will be "Renate learns more about her powers... <i>and herself/life/evil/something DUN DUN DUUUUN</i>"</font><br>
[Fri Jul 28 22:34:48 2006] : <B>(2) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>(Hm, well, I can hr to Forengil and see what we can do, but I probably don't have a proper cliffhanger for you.)</font><br>
[Fri Jul 28 22:35:15 2006] : <B>(4) Aryk</B>: <font color='#000080'>(Yeah, I think we should stop before that.  I'm getting all migraine-y.)</font><br>
[Fri Jul 28 22:35:23 2006] : <B>(3) Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>(Go ahead and hr.)</font><br>
[Fri Jul 28 22:35:40 2006] : <B>(3) Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>(Or we can call it a short night. Whatever.)</font><br>
[Fri Jul 28 22:37:00 2006] : <B>(4) Aryk</B>: <font color='#000080'>(Well, not really a short night.  We've been playing for 3 1/2 hours.  :-)</font><br>
[Fri Jul 28 22:37:23 2006] : <B>(2) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>(Hm, in that case, let's cut it. We just had 20 more minutes, and if Aryk's head is breaking, better to just relax for now.)</font><br>
[Fri Jul 28 22:37:37 2006] : <B>(2) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>(We'll be able to hop right into substantial stuff.)</font><br>
[Fri Jul 28 22:37:50 2006] : <B>(2) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>Log is off. Good work on that phantasm puzzle, folks.</font><br>
[Fri Jul 28 22:37:54 2006] : <B>(2) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>I liked how that worked out.</font><br>
[Fri Jul 28 22:38:06 2006] : <B>(4) Aryk</B>: <font color='#000080'>Me too.</font><br>
[Fri Jul 28 22:38:26 2006] : <B>(2) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>And if you're willing to internalize this whole worlds-within-minds thing as a storytelling symbol, you'll see this turn into a fairly interesting "concept" adventure.</font><br>
[Fri Jul 28 22:39:40 2006] : <B>(2) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>I prefer the real world too, but since I consider it realer and more important than the chaos of other dimensions or mental landscapes, that can make the dimensions and mindscapes more startling by comparison.</font><br>
[Fri Jul 28 22:39:53 2006] : <B>(2) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>So there'll be shades of Psychonauts coming up.</font><br>
[Fri Jul 28 22:40:13 2006] : <B>(3) Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>psychonauts?</font><br>
[Fri Jul 28 22:41:06 2006] : <B>(2) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>Really great PS2/XBox/PC game that came out a year or two ago. Really distinctive cartoonish 3D art style, very slick writing, about a summer camp for telepathic kids.</font><br>
[Fri Jul 28 22:41:53 2006] : <B>(2) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>They're being taught to use their abilities and maybe some day join the elite government heroes called the Psychonauts... but of course EBIL STRIKES and the hero has to adventure into people's minds to stop it.</font><br>
[Fri Jul 28 22:42:08 2006] : <B>(3) Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>ebil has a way of doing that</font><br>
[Fri Jul 28 22:42:13 2006] : <B>(2) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>Each person's mind is this wonderfully twisted environment based on their personality.</font><br>
[Fri Jul 28 22:42:21 2006] : <B>(2) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>The conspiracy nut's mind, in particular, is awesome.</font><br>
[Fri Jul 28 22:42:43 2006] : <B>(1) Rien</B>: <font color='#004000'>Because conspiracy nuts always think they're awesome.</font><br>
[Fri Jul 28 22:42:56 2006] : <B>(3) Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>there's a post-Sandman Sandman collection called "Endless Nights" that has a Delirium adventure in it that sounds sort of psychonaut-ish</font><br>
[Fri Jul 28 22:43:04 2006] : <B>(2) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>But even the sane people have really interesting minds, like the calm and logical instructor whose entire mindscape is just a cube suspended in space, which snaps out into geometric constructions.</font><br>
[Fri Jul 28 22:43:21 2006] : <B>(1) Rien</B>: <font color='#004000'>I shall have to try and find this game.</font><br>
[Fri Jul 28 22:43:39 2006] : <B>(4) Aryk</B>: <font color='#000080'>Yeah, me too.</font><br>
[Fri Jul 28 22:43:49 2006] : <B>(2) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>If you can find it, you can probably find it cheap. I'm <i>pretty</i> sure there's a PC version, which would be even cheaper for Adrian.</font><br>
[Fri Jul 28 22:43:59 2006] : <B>(2) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>I got it through Gamefly before I ran out of gaming time.</font><br>
[Fri Jul 28 22:45:01 2006] : <B>(2) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>I didn't actually finish it, but I played all the parts people raved about the most before I got sidetracked.</font><br>
[Fri Jul 28 22:46:12 2006] : <B>(1) Rien</B>: <font color='#004000'>Well, yes, cheaper, because of the whole 'not having to buy an XBox thing."</font><br>
[Fri Jul 28 22:47:06 2006] : <B>(2) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>Hey, I BitTorrent stuff all the time, particularly if I'm not sure I'll like it.</font><br>
[Fri Jul 28 22:47:49 2006] : <B>(2) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>Sure, I probably shouldn't, but it's a pretty gray area. I can pretty much assure you nobody's lost a sale from me.</font><br>
[Fri Jul 28 22:48:09 2006] : <B>(2) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>Hm. Not "all the time," because I'm lazy, but yeah.</font><br>
