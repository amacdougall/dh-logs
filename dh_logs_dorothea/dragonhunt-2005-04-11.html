[Mon Apr 11 22:39:30 2005] : <B>Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>you can never go wrong with cute around Renate</font><br>
[Mon Apr 11 22:39:47 2005] : <B>Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>Well, it was mostly because he doesn't know exactly what to do about it except follow Poya's advice.</font><br>

[Mon Apr 11 22:40:08 2005] : <B>Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>"If it looks like a gesture, it probably is."</font><br>
[Mon Apr 11 22:40:13 2005] : <B>Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>heh</font><br>
[Mon Apr 11 22:40:18 2005] : <B>Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>He's going to be cluelessly shopping for earrings or something now.</font><br>
[Mon Apr 11 22:40:20 2005] : <B>Rien</B>: <font color='#004040'>ummm... which sword does he think he's just been given?</font><br>

[Mon Apr 11 22:40:34 2005] : <B>Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>The one her papa gave her when she was twelve, of course.</font><br>
[Mon Apr 11 22:40:44 2005] : <B>Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>He can't have Crescent Light; as she said, it's not hers to give.</font><br>
[Mon Apr 11 22:41:12 2005] : <B>Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>he doesn't have to buy her anything! sheesh</font><br>
[Mon Apr 11 22:41:30 2005] : <B>Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>in her mind, she's just paying him back for the loan of a potion gauntlet, a few years back</font><br>
[Mon Apr 11 22:41:52 2005] : <B>Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>and it just makes her happy to be able to be useful to him</font><br>
[Mon Apr 11 22:42:17 2005] : <B>Rien</B>: <font color='#004040'>but that's what it means to her</font><br>
[Mon Apr 11 22:42:25 2005] : <B>Rien</B>: <font color='#004040'>to him it's an entirely different kettle of fish</font><br>
[Mon Apr 11 22:42:35 2005] : <B>Rien</B>: <font color='#004040'>and, honestly, who the hell puts fish in a kettle?</font><br>
[Mon Apr 11 22:42:38 2005] : <B>Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>well, he ought to ASK, then, silly ass</font><br>
[Mon Apr 11 22:42:45 2005] : <B>Rien</B>: <font color='#004040'>"excuse me, I just have to make a nice cup of fish tea."</font><br>
[Mon Apr 11 22:42:54 2005] : <B>Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>she didn't make a big deal out of it because he always gets embarrassed when she does that</font><br>
[Mon Apr 11 22:43:26 2005] : <B>Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>but I will say that she IS aware of the feudal implications of handing the guy a sword</font><br>
[Mon Apr 11 22:43:28 2005] : <B>Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>and leave it at that</font><br>
[Mon Apr 11 22:43:36 2005] : <B>Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>but anyway, I have early class tomorrow and should be sleeping</font><br>
