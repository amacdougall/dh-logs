[Sun May  9 13:34:34 2010] : <b>(7380) Alan</b>: <font color='#00008c'>So hi.</font><br />
[Sun May  9 13:34:50 2010] : <b>(7379) Renate</b>: <font color='#000080'>heya!</font><br />
[Sun May  9 13:34:56 2010] : <b>(7380) Alan</b>: <font color='#00008c'>When did ice cubes that are actually cubical become rare?</font><br />
[Sun May  9 13:35:08 2010] : <b>(7380) Alan</b>: <font color='#00008c'>I got these nifty new silicone ice cube trays and they're awesome.</font><br />
[Sun May  9 13:35:11 2010] : <b>(7379) Renate</b>: <font color='#000080'>I believe Renate has a small manufactory to check out?</font><br />
[Sun May  9 13:36:37 2010] : <b>(7380) Alan</b>: <font color='#00008c'>You might also want to talk to the local blacksmith -- for one thing, he's the only heavy metalworker in the tri-county area, and for another, he moved from Atlantis only last year. (He's the one who told Charles Gailand about the ocean, and had to resort to "okay, imagine a lake... now imagine a FREAKIN HUGE lake.")</font><br />
[Sun May  9 13:36:46 2010] : <b>(7379) Renate</b>: <font color='#000080'>Good idea.</font><br />
[Sun May  9 13:37:13 2010] : <b>(7380) Alan</b>: <font color='#00008c'>You probably do not want to talk to Adam, but that doesn't mean it would be unproductive.</font><br />
[Sun May  9 13:37:22 2010] : <b>(7379) Renate</b>: <font color='#000080'>Oh, she does. Just not first thing.</font><br />
[Sun May  9 13:37:24 2010] : <b>(7380) Alan</b>: <font color='#00008c'>I just mean you probably don't <i>want</i> to.</font><br />
[Sun May  9 13:37:40 2010] : <b>(7379) Renate</b>: <font color='#000080'>It needs to be done. Therefore it will be. That's Renate for you.</font><br />
[Sun May  9 13:39:10 2010] : <b>(7380) Alan</b>: <font color='#00008c'>Adam's changed a lot since he, Randall, Sabra, and Zan did their Scooby Gang act in seminary.</font><br />
[Sun May  9 13:41:14 2010] : <b>(7380) Alan</b>: <font color='#00008c'>So anyway, where do you want to start? Master Tell has invited you to take your ease, see the town, visit the farms, with a guide or on your own, with fresh horses or with your own.</font><br />
[Sun May  9 13:41:43 2010] : <b>(7379) Renate</b>: <font color='#000080'>She'll take a guide, if one can be spared -- she doesn't want to take anyone away from work.</font><br />
[Sun May  9 13:41:52 2010] : <b>(7380) Alan</b>: <font color='#00008c'>It's hard to tell if he's overdoing the hospitality or if he's just always eager to please.</font><br />
[Sun May  9 13:42:11 2010] : <b>(7379) Renate</b>: <font color='#000080'>An older child will do just fine.</font><br />
[Sun May  9 13:43:28 2010] : <b>(7380) Alan</b>: <font color='#00008c'>As a matter of fact, that's exactly who he suggests -- one Jemyra Losch, a bright sixteen-year-old who served as Margaret Wilkes' guide when she was surveying Margolin.</font><br />
[Sun May  9 13:43:32 2010] : <b>(7379) Renate</b>: <font color='#000080'>(Well, part of the point of hanging out is to get enough information to triangulate what's going on.)</font><br />
[Sun May  9 13:43:39 2010] : <b>(7379) Renate</b>: <font color='#000080'>Perfect.</font><br />
[Sun May  9 13:44:09 2010] : <b>(7380) Alan</b>: <font color='#00008c'>Having helped put together the maps and census materials, she knows as much about the lie of the land as anyone in Margolin now.</font><br />
[Sun May  9 13:44:27 2010] : <b>(7379) Renate</b>: <font color='#000080'>"Hello, Jemyra." Renate holds out her hand to the girl.</font><br />
[Sun May  9 13:44:42 2010] : <b>(7380) Alan</b>: <font color='#00008c'>(I meant "lay of the land." Not a Freudian slip!)</font><br />
[Sun May  9 13:44:52 2010] : <b>(7379) Renate</b>: <font color='#000080'>(heh)</font><br />
[Sun May  9 13:44:56 2010] : <b>(7380) Alan</b>: <font color='#00008c'>(Although I think "lie" is grammatically correct.)</font><br />
[Sun May  9 13:45:09 2010] : <b>(7379) Renate</b>: <font color='#000080'>(this is another thing about which Words Will Be Had with Master Mayonet.)</font><br />
[Sun May  9 13:45:18 2010] : <b>(7380) Alan</b>: <font color='#00008c'>"Hello, my lady," she replies, taking Renate's hand and bobbing a curtsey.</font><br />
[Sun May  9 13:45:45 2010] : <b>(7380) Alan</b>: <font color='#00008c'>(Land and the lying thereof?)</font><br />
[Sun May  9 13:46:00 2010] : <b>(7379) Renate</b>: <font color='#000080'>"I'm grateful for your willingness to lead me about. I hope I haven't taken you away from anything important -- or fun."</font><br />
[Sun May  9 13:46:10 2010] : <b>(7379) Renate</b>: <font color='#000080'>(Lying, anyway. In several senses of the word.)</font><br />
[Sun May  9 13:47:50 2010] : <b>(7380) Alan</b>: <font color='#00008c'>"You haven't," she replies simply. "One can only embroider so many antimaccassars."</font><br />
[Sun May  9 13:48:44 2010] : <b>(7379) Renate</b>: <font color='#000080'>"Oh, dear. Where did your family come from?" Renate snaps out her cane and makes for the door.</font><br />
[Sun May  9 13:49:33 2010] : <b>(7380) Alan</b>: <font color='#00008c'>She doesn't look like the embroidering sort: she's dressed for the occasion in durable but breathable linens, well-worn boots, various pouches hanging on a well-thought-out leather harness, and a broad straw hat to shield her from the late summer sun.</font><br />
[Sun May  9 13:49:57 2010] : <b>(7379) Renate</b>: <font color='#000080'>"If you don't mind me asking."</font><br />
[Sun May  9 13:51:49 2010] : <b>(7380) Alan</b>: <font color='#00008c'>"Of course not, but I wish I had more to tell. I'm a foundling. My parents heard me crying in a hollow near a stump while they were escaping from Selbyton."</font><br />
[Sun May  9 13:52:40 2010] : <b>(7379) Renate</b>: <font color='#000080'>Name ring a bell?</font><br />
[Sun May  9 13:52:58 2010] : <b>(7379) Renate</b>: <font color='#000080'>"And they came straight here, did they?"</font><br />
[Sun May  9 13:53:17 2010] : <b>(7380) Alan</b>: <font color='#00008c'>"Before Selbyton, they lived many places, and as I grew up, we still moved around a lot. Permanent refugees, or 'displaced persons,' we're called."</font><br />
[Sun May  9 13:53:57 2010] : <b>(7379) Renate</b>: <font color='#000080'>Renate nods. "I'd like to say I hope you'll find a lasting home here, but something tells me you have other ideas for your life."</font><br />
[Sun May  9 13:54:12 2010] : <b>(7380) Alan</b>: <font color='#00008c'>(Nope; just another one of the Patchwork towns that gets continually sacked, I guess.)</font><br />
[Sun May  9 13:55:13 2010] : <b>(7380) Alan</b>: <font color='#00008c'>"I hope to go to the city, my lady, and get an education. My parents made sure I could read and write. We used to ask people if we could have the newspapers they were using as firestarters."</font><br />
[Sun May  9 13:55:49 2010] : <b>(7379) Renate</b>: <font color='#000080'>"An education in anything particular?" Renate evinces no surprise, and certainly no disapproval; rather the opposite, if anything.</font><br />
[Sun May  9 13:56:00 2010] : <b>(7380) Alan</b>: <font color='#00008c'>"That's how I know about the size of the refugee problem. There are tens of thousands of us, people with no home. Established communities don't want to take in refugees."</font><br />
[Sun May  9 13:56:19 2010] : <b>(7380) Alan</b>: <font color='#00008c'>She's speaking calmly, but Renate can tell from her heart rate that it's an emotional issue for her.</font><br />
[Sun May  9 13:56:42 2010] : <b>(7380) Alan</b>: <font color='#00008c'>"I don't know yet, my lady, but if I can do anything to help others like my family, I will."</font><br />
[Sun May  9 13:57:31 2010] : <b>(7380) Alan</b>: <font color='#00008c'>"Mistress Wilkes said she would put in a good word for me in Ilium. Maybe I can move there."</font><br />
[Sun May  9 13:58:35 2010] : <b>(7379) Renate</b>: <font color='#000080'>Renate nods. "A laudable aim. Well, I have friends in Ilium as well, and I will see what can be done for you, no matter how my status here in Margolin winds up. I will commend you to my Lady Lyria also; I believe she will approve of you."</font><br />
[Sun May  9 13:59:49 2010] : <b>(7380) Alan</b>: <font color='#00008c'>"Thank you, my lady. If I might ask, who is Lady Lyria?"</font><br />
[Sun May  9 14:00:53 2010] : <b>(7379) Renate</b>: <font color='#000080'>"She is my patroness, a Faerie lady. She champions all those with great dreams, and the more difficult and hopeless-seeming the dream, the better-pleased she is."</font><br />
[Sun May  9 14:01:11 2010] : <b>(7380) Alan</b>: <font color='#00008c'>(The good word is still mostly centered in cities, where cadres of disaffected youth can spread the fight-the-power message through art and music; though there's been an upswing in Lyria worship, or at least hurried invocations, among soldiers as well.)</font><br />
[Sun May  9 14:02:13 2010] : <b>(7380) Alan</b>: <font color='#00008c'>(Many people use the deities as a sort of paint palette of influences to invoke or propitiate as appropriate, sort of like Roman gods. Lyria is entering the public consciousness in that capacity as well.)</font><br />
[Sun May  9 14:02:22 2010] : <b>(7379) Renate</b>: <font color='#000080'>(Excellent.)</font><br />
[Sun May  9 14:03:06 2010] : <b>(7380) Alan</b>: <font color='#00008c'>(And, by the rules of planar interactions, it works -- sacrifice a few copper to Lyria, it turns to worthless lead or stone, she stores its karma as personal essence; then later, maybe she can bend the rules of time and space by just a hair to save you from an arrow.)</font><br />
[Sun May  9 14:03:47 2010] : <b>(7379) Renate</b>: <font color='#000080'>"If I am accepted here, I will build her a shrine. I would be honored if you would keep it for me, when I cannot be here."</font><br />
[Sun May  9 14:03:51 2010] : <b>(7380) Alan</b>: <font color='#00008c'>(Unfortunately, many of her worshippers are asking for larger paydays than "make this arrow go a centimeter more to the left.")</font><br />
[Sun May  9 14:04:49 2010] : <b>(7380) Alan</b>: <font color='#00008c'>"Certainly, my lady." She drops another curtsey.</font><br />

[Sun May  9 14:25:55 2010] : <b>(7380) Alan</b>: <font color='#00008c'>"The Company patrols can only do so much. If there is a full bandit attack, Master Tell can telegraph for a mercenary division to show up in four hours, at great expense. But little hit and run attacks, taking a horse here, a few goats there, are impossible to deal with.

"Whether it's lasso, bow, or sword, we should be ready." She slows her horse to a walk and gets her bow out of its case. "I can help you with yours if you like, my lady."</font><br />
[Sun May  9 14:37:32 2010] : <b>(7380) Alan</b>: <font color='#00008c'>Everyone has heard the stories that, as long as someone else is around to see for her, Renate can do anything except read, so people don't generally leap to assist her every motion.</font><br />
[Sun May  9 14:38:13 2010] : <b>(7379) Renate</b>: <font color='#000080'>"I can manage, thank you." Renate strings the bow with alacrity, testing the pull. "I haven't done this in a while; we'll see how it goes. Jemyra -- how many of the bandits are dispossessed folk?"</font><br />

[Sun May  9 14:42:08 2010] : <b>(7380) Alan</b>: <font color='#00008c'>"Of course, a religious gang war carried out amid glitzy Parnesse nightlife? That's a bard song all by itself. But compared to fighting dragons, it's small potatoes."</font><br />

[Sun May  9 14:44:14 2010] : <b>(7379) Renate</b>: <font color='#000080'>Renate nods slowly. "That is... very well said, Jemyra. Very well said. As for cruelty, well -- a cruel person wouldn't want to bring her education back here to help. She'd want to go up and out."</font><br />

[Sun May  9 14:46:16 2010] : <b>(7380) Alan</b>: <font color='#00008c'>The land rises here to form a long, long ridge, a ripple that may originate (as Rien would say) at the tectonic level. Sharp rocks decorate its edge, giving the illusion of a wall of jagged teeth.</font><br />
[Sun May  9 14:46:43 2010] : <b>(7380) Alan</b>: <font color='#00008c'>Jemyra dismounts, taking her bow with her and slinging the quiver over her shoulder, where it neatly hooks into her work harness.</font><br />

[Sun May  9 14:47:50 2010] : <b>(7380) Alan</b>: <font color='#00008c'>You left the farmland behind a few klicks ago; you've been going along an animal trail in the woods.</font><br />
[Sun May  9 14:48:21 2010] : <b>(7379) Renate</b>: <font color='#000080'>She motions Jemyra to lead, already half-crouching, bow held with an arrow to the string.</font><br />
[Sun May  9 14:49:49 2010] : <b>(7380) Alan</b>: <font color='#00008c'>Jemyra is no rogue, but she lopes along in a low crouch with little noise and mounts the Crest, dropping to a crawl before she reaches the line of rocks. They're natural, it seems; splinters of an ancient slow-motion collision of the earth, too vertical for plants to take root and break it down.</font><br />
[Sun May  9 14:50:20 2010] : <b>(7380) Alan</b>: <font color='#00008c'>Jemyra slips between two of the rocks, whispering, "stay there; look through my eyes."</font><br />

[Sun May  9 15:20:24 2010] : <b>(7379) Renate</b>: <font color='#000080'>"I'm sorry, Jemyra. May Uriel be kind to them." If they died. Renate hopes they died, and her face shows it.</font><br />
[Sun May  9 15:22:22 2010] : <b>(7380) Alan</b>: <font color='#00008c'>"They rezzed the bandit casualties too, to question them. They didn't learn anything useful, though. They said the occultist just recruited them for, well, straightforward crime. 'Join me and I'll help you steal things and rape people.' Then that's what they did."</font><br />
[Sun May  9 15:23:27 2010] : <b>(7380) Alan</b>: <font color='#00008c'>"So after questioning them, the Company held them in jail until the Ilium circuit judge came to Merillford, and the judge sentenced them to hanging. Not that it does anyone any good."</font><br />

[Sun May  9 15:25:22 2010] : <b>(7380) Alan</b>: <font color='#00008c'>"There's one bandit in jail right now, if you want to talk to him... I thought you should see the Charred Wastes first, though."</font><br />
[Sun May  9 15:26:59 2010] : <b>(7379) Renate</b>: <font color='#000080'>"That's fine. I sense this will be a long day." She says it with a rueful smile. "Thank you, Jemyra, for trusting me this far."</font><br />
[Sun May  9 15:28:52 2010] : <b>(7380) Alan</b>: <font color='#00008c'>"You're the new ruler, my lady. One must trust you to sort things out."</font><br />

[Sun May  9 15:32:05 2010] : <b>(7380) Alan</b>: <font color='#00008c'>"Not to state the obvious, my lady, but trust comes in many flavors. Telling you all our problems hardly creates a confessional bond."</font><br />
[Sun May  9 15:32:49 2010] : <b>(7380) Alan</b>: <font color='#00008c'>"So, you could say that we're all glad to trust you with our problems, because you are welcome to them."</font><br />
[Sun May  9 15:32:54 2010] : <b>(7379) Renate</b>: <font color='#000080'>"True enough. But it's a start, at least. I sensed in town that matters were being held back from me, and it troubled me. I take it Ilium's taxes are higher than one would wish?"</font><br />
[Sun May  9 15:33:53 2010] : <b>(7380) Alan</b>: <font color='#00008c'>"That's what they say, but then they want an army to protect their goats. An army closer than four hours away."</font><br />

[Sun May  9 15:36:55 2010] : <b>(7379) Renate</b>: <font color='#000080'>"Well, I think we can do even a bit better than that. I might start with a library, myself -- for all I can't read without a horrid great mechanism that Shrapnel Dragon once made me."</font><br />
[Sun May  9 15:37:22 2010] : <b>(7379) Renate</b>: <font color='#000080'>"There's a question about how much Margolin is being taxed, too -- and if it needs asking in Ilium, I'll see it's asked."</font><br />

I'd raid my father's master-at-arms if I dared. Since I don't dare, I'll try for one of those he trained." She thinks briefly of Coris, then discards the thought; Coris must be busy, and bringing him to Margolin could only be awkward.

[Sun May  9 15:40:39 2010] : <b>(7380) Alan</b>: <font color='#00008c'>"His name is Oliver Maslow. He's put forth Whittaker Kovacs, a local shepherd, to take over for him when the Company security gives way to Ilium's."</font><br />

[Sun May  9 16:05:49 2010] : <b>(7380) Alan</b>: <font color='#00008c'>Jemyra gives Renate the general layout of the farms surrounding the town of Margolin; and shortly after noon, you arrive back in the town.

[Sun May  9 16:09:41 2010] : <b>(7380) Alan</b>: <font color='#00008c'>"Goods, at first. Part of the plan for the transfer of power is for Ilium to set up a branch bank which will release currency into the economy, though.

[Sun May  9 16:10:43 2010] : <b>(7379) Renate</b>: <font color='#000080'>"I see. Then taxes are being levied on individuals and families, not on Margolin as a whole."</font><br />
[Sun May  9 16:11:05 2010] : <b>(7380) Alan</b>: <font color='#00008c'>"And Margolin does have <i>some</i> currency. People do take their goods to market down west, and bring back money."</font><br />

[Sun May  9 16:14:15 2010] : <b>(7379) Renate</b>: <font color='#000080'>"Right, but the question is whether Ilium is setting a lump sum that Margolin can decide how to meet, or whether Ilium is determining what each citizen pays. I'd prefer the former system, frankly."</font><br />
