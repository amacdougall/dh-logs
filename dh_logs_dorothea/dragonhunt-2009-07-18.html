The archdemons have waited sixteen centuries for this moment: "for the dark elves!" is their cry, as they blot out the archangelic inspiration and cut powerless elves from the sky.</font><br />

[Sat Jul 18 01:22:32 2009] : <b>(1130) Alan</b>: <font color='#000080'>....but when they did their big dimension-shift spell, the dragons "split up" and each went to a different dimension out of all possible alternate realities.</font><br />
[Sat Jul 18 01:22:49 2009] : <b>(1130) Alan</b>: <font color='#000080'>They were looking for a dimension they could exist in.</font><br />
[Sat Jul 18 01:23:17 2009] : <b>(1130) Alan</b>: <font color='#000080'>Some of them found dimensions that were similar but not quite close enough; they were stuck watching those dimensions from the "outside," out of phase with them, only able to see but not interact.</font><br />
[Sat Jul 18 01:23:47 2009] : <b>(1130) Alan</b>: <font color='#000080'>They learned science or politics or whatever through observation, but in a lot of those dimensions the laws of physics were different... never mind that, anyway.</font><br />
[Sat Jul 18 01:24:33 2009] : <b>(1130) Alan</b>: <font color='#000080'>Dark Eternal found the game world dimension, and realizing that it was a good catch, he floated around agelessly for over two thousand years, from the end of the First Age until the end of the Second.</font><br />
[Sat Jul 18 01:25:04 2009] : <b>(1130) Alan</b>: <font color='#000080'>And finally called the rest of the Horde together to invade that dimension. He wasn't the leader or anything, just the guy who found the right place to pop back out of their dimension shift.</font><br />
[Sat Jul 18 01:25:15 2009] : <b>(1130) Alan</b>: <font color='#000080'>This is kind of complicated, I guess. But it's what the history has always been.</font><br />
[Sat Jul 18 01:25:21 2009] : <b>(1130) Alan</b>: <font color='#000080'>I think it's even on the website!</font><br />
[Sat Jul 18 01:25:28 2009] : <b>(1133) Noemi</b>: <font color='#710000'>Okay, well, first, why did Rubylith allow him to claim this world as his own?</font><br />
[Sat Jul 18 01:25:47 2009] : <b>(1130) Alan</b>: <font color='#000080'>It was a consensus. He said, "hey, this place is pretty good," and the rest of them decided it was.</font><br />
[Sat Jul 18 01:26:10 2009] : <b>(1133) Noemi</b>: <font color='#710000'>I was waiting for him to bust out with some chi and whoop Rubylith into submission.</font><br />

[Sat Jul 18 01:27:24 2009] : <b>(1133) Noemi</b>: <font color='#710000'>Second, explain the "body double" thing to me.</font><br />
[Sat Jul 18 01:28:03 2009] : <b>(1130) Alan</b>: <font color='#000080'>So that nobody would suspect Rousseau was Black Iron, he just got another black dragon to pretend to be him.</font><br />
[Sat Jul 18 01:28:12 2009] : <b>(1130) Alan</b>: <font color='#000080'>So he could pretend he was "making a deal" with Black Iron.</font><br />
