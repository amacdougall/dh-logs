[Fri May 16 18:52:09 2008] : <b>(7451) Alan</b>: <font color='#000080'>The dark shadow of the first demon spreads up through the roof of the club, and past it; a yawning arc of emptiness rises up into space, like the lofts of a cathedral at moonless midnight.</font><br />

[Fri May 16 18:53:35 2008] : <b>(7451) Alan</b>: <font color='#000080'>He clambers up onto the stage and immediately begins yelling a prayer, thin ash rod held overhead in both hands.</font><br />
[Fri May 16 18:54:18 2008] : <b>(7451) Alan</b>: <font color='#000080'>"Cuts us off from the Sacred World if we let it!" the dwarf cries, kneecapping his way through the crowd to intercept one of the demons.</font><br />

[Fri May 16 18:56:24 2008] : <b>(7451) Alan</b>: <font color='#000080'>There are about a dozen demons in the crowd, all fighting their way through toward the stage and Aryk. They don't seem too interested in anyone who isn't a threat, so as the audience falls back to let them through, they are generally unharmed.</font><br />
[Fri May 16 18:57:17 2008] : <b>(7451) Alan</b>: <font color='#000080'>Rien's holy blast knocks away the first four demons to reach the stage; they fly back into the audience, and are immediately shoved back into the rapidly clearing open space before the stage.

Aryk snaps, cutting another one after a quick look upward; this time the rope he's holding zips him up into the flies, just as a muscular black demon swipes giant flaming claws through the air where he was.</font><br />
