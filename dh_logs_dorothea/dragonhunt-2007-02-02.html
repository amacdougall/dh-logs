[Fri Feb  2 19:53:47 2007] : <B>(1) Alan</B>: <font color='#000000'>Bricks are falling out of the walls now, and you can see that the reinforcing rods or cables inside them are writhing and flexing like exposed tendons... they seem to be bunching like muscle over and over, as if to pull the entire building together like a fist.</font><br>

[Fri Feb  2 20:30:03 2007] : <B>(1) Alan</B>: <font color='#000000'>"There," Arno says, pointing up into the sun.</font><br>
[Fri Feb  2 20:31:01 2007] : <B>(1) Alan</B>: <font color='#000000'>A human shape is masked by the brilliance, but slowly becomes more clear as it floats down toward you.

[Fri Feb  2 20:31:30 2007] : <B>(1) Alan</B>: <font color='#000000'>The mantle manages to look like twin lion heads mounted as huge epaulettes, each lion mouth open and continually radiating a misty blue light.</font><br>

[Fri Feb  2 20:33:52 2007] : <B>(1) Alan</B>: <font color='#000000'>He says something else, and now you can hear it; the language he is speaking bears a resemblance to the ancient non-Elven tongues of Northrock, which were incorporated into the Northrock Trade Tongue.</font><br>

[Fri Feb  2 20:41:35 2007] : <B>(1) Alan</B>: <font color='#000000'>This seems to be enough to satisfy the emissary. "So you deactivated the dragon's handiwork through your own efforts?

[Fri Feb  2 20:42:20 2007] : <B>(2) Tancred</B>: <font color='#000080'>"Yes, great, thank you -- can we go now?"</font><br>
[Fri Feb  2 20:42:28 2007] : <B>(1) Alan</B>: <font color='#000000'>"I will go to the temple to recover the physical components. But first, let me remove you to a place of safety."</font><br>

[Fri Feb  2 20:43:45 2007] : <B>(1) Alan</B>: <font color='#000000'>It seems to be inertialess and wind-shielded, because you have no sensation of movement even when he, the disk, and you rise far into the air and begin to move south at what would surely be a sickening rate of speed if you were low enough to get a sense of it.</font><br>
[Fri Feb  2 20:44:30 2007] : <B>(1) Alan</B>: <font color='#000000'>Arno, despite his distrust of most forms of magic, is delighted by this mode of transport, and smiles for the first time in quite a while as he takes in the view. "Now this is being a Blue Sky Warden!"</font><br>
[Fri Feb  2 20:46:24 2007] : <B>(1) Alan</B>: <font color='#000000'>"You came here from Northrock. Does this mean the Geography Accords have been relaxed?" the blue-robed man asks. He is putting on a show of aloofness, but he seems as enthralled by the aerial view as Arno.</font><br>

[Fri Feb  2 20:51:31 2007] : <B>(2) Tancred</B>: <font color='#000080'>"Believe me, this place is as good an argument for the Geography Accords as I can imagine."</font><br>
[Fri Feb  2 20:52:58 2007] : <B>(1) Alan</B>: <font color='#000000'>"This is one of the outermost population centers of the Teslanic League. I believe they call it Chart Town. You can find passage up or down the Turquoise River to anywhere you wish to go."</font><br>
[Fri Feb  2 20:54:24 2007] : <B>(2) Tancred</B>: <font color='#000080'>"Back of beyond," is Tancred's surly reply. "Just figures, doesn't it?"</font><br>

[Fri Feb  2 20:56:21 2007] : <B>(2) Tancred</B>: <font color='#000080'>"Well, that was absolutely positively no fun at all. And we're if anything even further away from Lucrecia. Let this be a lesson, Arno; don't let anybody buy your drinks."</font><br>
[Fri Feb  2 20:56:44 2007] : <B>(2) Tancred</B>: <font color='#000080'>"Not a clue, and I can't ask Menkhda yet. We'll have to find out the old-fashioned way."</font><br>
[Fri Feb  2 20:57:18 2007] : <B>(1) Alan</B>: <font color='#000000'>The town down below has a commercial drag along a main street, a variety of outlying buildings, still mostly commercial in appearance, and a few blocks of residences; but about half again as much area is occupied with tents and bazaar-like stalls.</font><br>
[Fri Feb  2 20:58:03 2007] : <B>(1) Alan</B>: <font color='#000000'>The climate here is dry, the ground is covered with hardy green-brown grasses.</font><br>

[Fri Feb  2 20:59:02 2007] : <B>(1) Alan</B>: <font color='#000000'>The river is wide and placid, and wide enough that its far side melts together as "scenery."</font><br>

A road leads from Chart Town up to a large three-story building of a decidedly monastic cast, perched on a hill opposite your own.

[Fri Feb  2 23:11:34 2007] : <B>(2) Tancred</B>: <font color='#000080'>not least because the look on Renate's face if she pulls this off is gonna be... interesting!</font><br>
[Fri Feb  2 23:11:40 2007] : <B>(1) Alan</B>: <font color='#000000'>Renate won't though. Zing part II</font><br>
[Fri Feb  2 23:11:48 2007] : <B>(2) Tancred</B>: <font color='#000080'>:P</font><br>
[Fri Feb  2 23:12:15 2007] : <B>(2) Tancred</B>: <font color='#000080'>As for rewards, btw, I think DnD tradition would suggest a heap big magic item.</font><br>
[Fri Feb  2 23:12:53 2007] : <B>(2) Tancred</B>: <font color='#000080'>And Renate will be most impressed if it has a long history; she's -- not snobbish, but certainly aware of antiquity.</font><br>
[Fri Feb  2 23:12:57 2007] : <B>(3) Sashi</B>: <font color='#004000'>Gold, and a bunch of XP are traditional too.</font><br>
[Fri Feb  2 23:13:43 2007] : <B>(1) Alan</B>: <font color='#000000'>Well, "big heap magic item" in the Dragonhunt means "magic item with interesting capabilities and significant drawbacks."</font><br>
[Fri Feb  2 23:13:46 2007] : <B>(1) Alan</B>: <font color='#000000'>But yeah.</font><br>
[Fri Feb  2 23:14:03 2007] : <B>(2) Tancred</B>: <font color='#000080'>bah, nobody else's magic items have significant drawbacks!</font><br>
[Fri Feb  2 23:14:19 2007] : <B>(2) Tancred</B>: <font color='#000080'>Well, Colette's, maybe.</font><br>
[Fri Feb  2 23:14:24 2007] : <B>(2) Tancred</B>: <font color='#000080'>But not Keph LoCaine's!</font><br>
[Fri Feb  2 23:14:46 2007] : <B>(1) Alan</B>: <font color='#000000'>That's because he only plunders and loots the best.</font><br>
[Fri Feb  2 23:15:00 2007] : <B>(3) Sashi</B>: <font color='#004000'>So... give Renate the best.</font><br>
[Fri Feb  2 23:15:03 2007] : <B>(2) Tancred</B>: <font color='#000080'>Renate still has the birthday present from Trancey. She's saving it for a special occasion.</font><br>
[Fri Feb  2 23:15:11 2007] : <B>(1) Alan</B>: <font color='#000000'>Consumable items usually don't have drawbacks, like wands and scrolls and things.</font><br>
[Fri Feb  2 23:15:41 2007] : <B>(1) Alan</B>: <font color='#000000'>Depends on the power of the effect. Anyway, it originally started because I wanted most of the power in the game to come from within the people, with items as a flashy accessory.</font><br>
[Fri Feb  2 23:15:56 2007] : <B>(1) Alan</B>: <font color='#000000'>So I'll think of something nice.</font><br>
[Fri Feb  2 23:16:34 2007] : <B>(2) Tancred</B>: <font color='#000080'>Well, you don't necessarily have to. Since Renate promised to keep whatever he gives her, he could stick her with the stupidest damn thing in his treasury.</font><br>
[Fri Feb  2 23:16:39 2007] : <B>(2) Tancred</B>: <font color='#000080'>Real mathomville.</font><br>
[Fri Feb  2 23:17:27 2007] : <B>(2) Tancred</B>: <font color='#000080'>That would only confirm her low opinion of herself, however.</font><br>
[Fri Feb  2 23:18:17 2007] : <B>(1) Alan</B>: <font color='#000000'>Pff, it'll be nice, don't worry about that.</font><br>
[Fri Feb  2 23:18:43 2007] : <B>(1) Alan</B>: <font color='#000000'>I'm just deciding if it's "nice to smash foes with" or "would fetch a mint at Sotheby's"</font><br>
[Fri Feb  2 23:19:02 2007] : <B>(2) Tancred</B>: <font color='#000080'>lol!</font><br>
[Fri Feb  2 23:19:11 2007] : <B>(2) Tancred</B>: <font color='#000080'>the latter won't be much use; she DID promise to keep it!</font><br>
[Fri Feb  2 23:20:38 2007] : <B>(2) Tancred</B>: <font color='#000080'>well, I'm tired from a week of oxygen-deprivation in the office</font><br>
[Fri Feb  2 23:20:46 2007] : <B>(1) Alan</B>: <font color='#000000'>All right, I'm Audi.</font><br>
[Fri Feb  2 23:20:52 2007] : <B>(2) Tancred</B>: <font color='#000080'>see y'all!</font><br>
[Fri Feb  2 23:20:56 2007] : <font color='#ff0000'>Disconnecting from server...</font><br>
[Fri Feb  2 23:20:58 2007] : <font color='#ff0000'>Game disconnected!</font><br>
