[Sat Jan  1 18:11:02 2011] : <b>(7852) Renate</b>: <font color='#000080'>Well, what she did was pretty cold.</font><br />
[Sat Jan  1 18:11:12 2011] : <b>(7852) Renate</b>: <font color='#000080'>And it hurt Renate.</font><br />
[Sat Jan  1 18:12:02 2011] : <b>(7856) Aryk</b>: <font color='#800000'>Well, that was the final straw, there.  And you know, something felt fishy to him about her ever since she enchanted him, or whatever the hell she did, and Holmstock was all, "Never do that again."</font><br />

[Sat Jan  1 18:14:58 2011] : <b>(7855) Alan</b>: <font color='#612769'>Oh. A misunderstanding then... on the other hand, she still arbitrarily resurrected a few while giving the rest the true death. Pretty high-handed.</font><br />
[Sat Jan  1 18:15:20 2011] : <b>(7852) Renate</b>: <font color='#000080'>She doesn't think it was arbitrary.</font><br />
[Sat Jan  1 18:15:33 2011] : <b>(7852) Renate</b>: <font color='#000080'>And you might want to ask Renate what she thinks about having her lungs set on fire.</font><br />
[Sat Jan  1 18:15:42 2011] : <b>(7856) Aryk</b>: <font color='#800000'>I meant that the fact Renate was very nearly collateral damage is what set him off.</font><br />

[Sat Jan  1 18:19:17 2011] : <b>(7856) Aryk</b>: <font color='#800000'>er, way</font><br />
[Sat Jan  1 18:19:31 2011] : <b>(7855) Alan</b>: <font color='#612769'>Well, you guys stopped Heliomere, again, and although the word was that he had more backup coming from up north, things aren't looking good for him. Although he's powerful, he's a physical coward -- he refuses to risk his life no matter what. That's why he's never willingly come down to mix it up with you, even if he might win that way.</font><br />
[Sat Jan  1 18:20:11 2011] : <b>(7855) Alan</b>: <font color='#612769'>There's even money he's just going to seek greener pastures.</font><br />
[Sat Jan  1 18:20:15 2011] : <b>(7852) Renate</b>: <font color='#000080'>We're definitely wearing him down. And he presumably won't attack Margolin, Carrackshire, or Birch Creek directly if he can avoid it.</font><br />
[Sat Jan  1 18:20:22 2011] : <b>(7852) Renate</b>: <font color='#000080'>Because that brings the Seven Stars down on his happy ass.</font><br />
[Sat Jan  1 18:20:28 2011] : <b>(7856) Aryk</b>: <font color='#800000'>Maybe at least, if word spreads, people will be more reluctant to follow his lead now.</font><br />
[Sat Jan  1 18:21:08 2011] : <b>(7855) Alan</b>: <font color='#612769'>He bring woe and terror everywhere he goes, but he's pragmatic.</font><br />

[Sat Jan  1 21:28:29 2011] : <b>(7855) Alan</b>: <font color='#612769'>Right now Emily, Spike, the Carrackshire folks who have come in after the meeting was dissolved, and Godfrey (curiously) are singing "The Old Angry Dog." Classic country drinking song wherein the titular beast has such adventures as falling off a log, getting stuck in a bog, chasing a hog and the reverse, always with hilarious results.</font><br />
[Sat Jan  1 21:28:47 2011] : <b>(7852) Renate</b>: <font color='#000080'>Her blind face turns toward Zan and Rialto.</font><br />
[Sat Jan  1 21:28:49 2011] : <b>(7855) Alan</b>: <font color='#612769'>Evidently its typical movement pace is a jog.</font><br />
[Sat Jan  1 21:29:07 2011] : <b>(7855) Alan</b>: <font color='#612769'>Zan and Rialto are picking up the chorus as the song goes.</font><br />

[Sat Jan  1 21:29:40 2011] : <b>(7855) Alan</b>: <font color='#612769'>(No doubt! It did get lost in fog at one point.)</font><br />
[Sat Jan  1 21:29:51 2011] : <b>(7855) Alan</b>: <font color='#612769'>(Which did nothing to make it less angry.)</font><br />
[Sat Jan  1 21:29:56 2011] : <b>(7855) Alan</b>: <font color='#612769'>(You'd think it would learn some humility.)</font><br />
[Sat Jan  1 21:30:06 2011] : <b>(7872) Aryk</b>: <font color='#800000'>"What set me off was having Adam back, and him treating me the way he generally does, and I got to thinking, 'what makes him so much better than me?  Why can't I make a difference?' " Aryk rambles on.</font><br />
[Sat Jan  1 21:30:21 2011] : <b>(7852) Renate</b>: <font color='#000080'>"I slapped him once for that," Renate admits.</font><br />
[Sat Jan  1 21:30:37 2011] : <b>(7852) Renate</b>: <font color='#000080'>"But, look, Aryk, Zan and Rialto -- I don't think they know as much about the Church as you do."</font><br />
[Sat Jan  1 21:31:04 2011] : <b>(7852) Renate</b>: <font color='#000080'>"And I think that's going to be a problem, if it isn't already. They are -- very orthodox."</font><br />
[Sat Jan  1 21:32:53 2011] : <b>(7872) Aryk</b>: <font color='#800000'>Aryk is all smiles again, and Renate can feel the worry behind it.  "Don't worry, sis.  It'll be fine. We're all old friends!   Look, stick around for a while, will you?  Have some fun!  You deserve it!  I'm gonna go make the rounds, okay?"  He kisses her on the forehad, and, grabbing a beer from the bar unconsciously, makes his way over to Rien.</font><br />
[Sat Jan  1 21:33:18 2011] : <b>(7855) Alan</b>: <font color='#612769'>(Also, it's funny Renate should tell Aryk to make ripples, not waves, when earlier in the campaign she herself was deeply discouraged by the small results of her efforts.)</font><br />
[Sat Jan  1 21:33:27 2011] : <font color='#008000'>** (7852) Renate <font color='#008000'>looks down and sighs. All she can do is what she's done: warn him.</font> **</font><br />

[Sat Jan  1 21:34:04 2011] : <b>(7852) Renate</b>: <font color='#000080'>(Perhaps. She's also just barely smart enough to realize that Aryk can't charge the Church the way he would a bunch of zombies. Which is exactly what he was planning to do.)</font><br />
[Sat Jan  1 21:34:26 2011] : <b>(7855) Alan</b>: <font color='#612769'>(Well, he could, but he'd only kill four or five Cardinals before they stopped him.)</font><br />
[Sat Jan  1 21:34:27 2011] : <b>(7872) Aryk</b>: <font color='#800000'>He leans in on Rien.  "Bro, get your ass over to Renate now and apologize.  I'm not entirely sure what you did, but she's hurt, and she needs you to stop being a weirdo and be a compassionate, empathatic person for a while, you dig?!"  He slaps him on the back, pretty hard, and joins in the chorus.</font><br />
[Sat Jan  1 21:34:37 2011] : <b>(7852) Renate</b>: <font color='#000080'>(That was my point, yes.)</font><br />

YOU WILL BE BOOTED IF YOU POST IMAGES IN THE LOBBY!!!

<br><br>



<B>Oh and keep the language clean in the lobby.  This also is a bootable offense.</b>

<br><br>

<b>I recently had problems on my webserver at <a href="http://openrpg.wrathof.com/forums/downloads.php">http://openrpg.wrathof.com </a> and some of the character sheets have been deleted.  If you put a sheet up there or downloaded one from there could you check and see if it needs to be added again?  I'd appreciate any help getting the sheets back so others can have access to them. </b>
