[Fri Apr 15 20:55:56 2005] : <B>Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>As far as the sting goes, I think the thing to do is put Renate on a regular sort of patrol, and have people on various points watching for her. Less suspicious-looking than actually having her followed.</font><br>
[Fri Apr 15 20:56:17 2005] : <B>Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>And if we can hide some extra klieg lights along her route, so much the better.</font><br>
[Fri Apr 15 20:56:42 2005] : <B>Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>(per Adrian's brainstorm about magic shadows in light-drenched areas being, um, kinda conspicuous)</font><br>
[Fri Apr 15 20:56:52 2005] : <B>Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>(we'd leave the lights off until the alarm, of course)</font><br>
[Fri Apr 15 20:57:34 2005] : <B>Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>Rien, I believe, was planning to track her in the Mirror Realm, watching out for whatchamacallits doing magic.</font><br>
[Fri Apr 15 20:57:46 2005] : <B>Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>Want to recruit Colette to help with the lighting?</font><br>
[Fri Apr 15 20:57:53 2005] : <B>Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>Or is that just begging for a disaster?</font><br>
[Fri Apr 15 20:58:04 2005] : <B>Rien</B>: <font color='#004040'>probably the latter</font><br>
[Fri Apr 15 20:58:09 2005] : <B>Rien</B>: <font color='#004040'>becuase we want ot keep it quiet</font><br>
[Fri Apr 15 20:58:14 2005] : <B>Rien</B>: <font color='#004040'>and she is patently unable to do that</font><br>
[Fri Apr 15 20:58:19 2005] : <B>Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>Mm, yes, actually, but everybody from our team is on notice NOT TO TELL HER that there's a sting in the offing -- it's just ordinary precautions.</font><br>
[Fri Apr 15 20:58:35 2005] : <B>Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>In fact, Renate might use Colette to pass the false information to Raven.</font><br>
[Fri Apr 15 20:58:42 2005] : <B>Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>Convenient, that.</font><br>
[Fri Apr 15 20:59:23 2005] : <B>Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>So, is anybody on Coris's crew going to object to this plan, or suggest anything to add to it?</font><br>
[Fri Apr 15 20:59:30 2005] : <B>Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>And has Talos got any more info on Jenner's movements?</font><br>
[Fri Apr 15 20:59:41 2005] : <B>Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>Well, don't ask me to think right now.</font><br>
[Fri Apr 15 21:00:05 2005] : <B>Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>And Talos just sees that Linetta's been going off to parts unknown in some sort of bird form each night. Different direction each time, though that doesn't mean much.</font><br>
[Fri Apr 15 21:00:21 2005] : <B>Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>She could easily be randomizing her departure directions before homing in on the same place each time.</font><br>
[Fri Apr 15 21:00:33 2005] : <B>Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>yep</font><br>
[Fri Apr 15 21:01:14 2005] : <B>Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>As Master Plans go, I guess this one isn't too complicated. But if what we've got is a vamp nutjob on the loose, this should bring him out to play.</font><br>
[Fri Apr 15 21:01:44 2005] : <B>Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>And if not... well, Renate's keeping that line of reasoning to herself, but... if it's Jenner, she's the logical target anyway, so this plan will <i>still</i> bring the vamp nutjob out to play.</font><br>
[Fri Apr 15 21:02:11 2005] : <B>Rien</B>: <font color='#004040'>Rien should also be able to track Renate herself throguh the Mirror Realm if she's got a spell-containing object like the glyph on her</font><br>
[Fri Apr 15 21:02:54 2005] : <B>Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>Shouldn't be necessary. Renate will be on a route known in advance.</font><br>
[Fri Apr 15 21:03:20 2005] : <B>Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>Just remember that if you go physically into the Mirror Realm, you're far more vulnerable to certain types of planar magic. Not relevant yet, but...</font><br>

[Fri Apr 15 21:04:13 2005] : <B>Rien</B>: <font color='#004040'>this would be Not A Good Thing</font><br>
[Fri Apr 15 21:04:53 2005] : <B>Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>well, I'm a bit bemused why they haven't just gone and asked the frickin' Mage Knights to begin with</font><br>

[Fri Apr 15 21:05:41 2005] : <B>Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>I guess it's good for us they haven't</font><br>

[Fri Apr 15 21:06:49 2005] : <B>Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>well, it's on the list</font><br>

[Fri Apr 15 21:07:42 2005] : <B>Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>He'll fill the *exact* same role Genjiro did in the last campaign.</font><br>

[Fri Apr 15 21:08:15 2005] : <B>Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>nor do I; I'm just looking for allies, and a loophole for Coris.</font><br>
