[Fri Sep 30 19:10:57 2005] : <B>(4) Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>okay, so where are we starting?</font><br>
[Fri Sep 30 19:11:30 2005] : <B>(2) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>That depends. Let me lay out the very basics of the District first, so you can start to come up with a plan.</font><br>
[Fri Sep 30 19:11:54 2005] : <B>(2) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>I'm still not sure exactly what you're planning, really -- whether you're going to go kill that guy for Mia, or try to exorcise her ghosts, or what; and that's fine.</font><br>
[Fri Sep 30 19:12:00 2005] : <B>(2) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>I'll just roll with whatever you decide to do.</font><br>
[Fri Sep 30 19:12:05 2005] : <B>(2) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>Here are the basics of what she wrote:</font><br>
[Fri Sep 30 19:12:27 2005] : <B>(2) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>Clover District: Not just a ghetto. It's a world unto itself, due to the wonders of "democracy".</font><br>
[Fri Sep 30 19:12:50 2005] : <B>(2) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>Citizens of its surrounding areas voted for dragon aldermen who ran on platforms of "hey, we'll set police to patrol its borders, so you don't get mugged."</font><br>
[Fri Sep 30 19:13:03 2005] : <B>(2) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>The result was that citizens who were already on the down and out felt penned in.</font><br>
[Fri Sep 30 19:13:08 2005] : <B>(4) Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>(doesn't THAT sound familiar *cough*Gretna*cough*)</font><br>
[Fri Sep 30 19:13:10 2005] : <B>(2) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>So they made do with what they had.</font><br>
[Fri Sep 30 19:13:39 2005] : <B>(2) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>(Milwaukee. Try being black and poor-looking and wandering from Garden Home to Shorewood.)</font><br>
[Fri Sep 30 19:13:49 2005] : <B>(2) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>(You'll get a DWB instantly.)</font><br>
[Fri Sep 30 19:14:03 2005] : <B>(4) Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>(*shrug* no different in Fairfax, believe you me... only DWHispanic is worse than DWB.)</font><br>
[Fri Sep 30 19:14:08 2005] : <B>(3) Rien</B>: <font color='#004040'>(get a what?)</font><br>
[Fri Sep 30 19:14:17 2005] : <B>(2) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>(In fact, we were once driving behind a black guy, and saw a Shorewood police car driving by the other way, and said "that guy's getting pulled over"... then he did, two minutes later.)</font><br>
[Fri Sep 30 19:14:21 2005] : <B>(4) Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>(Driving While Black. Being pulled over by the police for no obvious reason.)</font><br>
[Fri Sep 30 19:14:38 2005] : <B>(4) Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>(Or, indeed, no reason at all except for the driver's race.)</font><br>
[Fri Sep 30 19:14:49 2005] : <B>(2) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>(Shorewood being the affluent white bigot neighborhood, of course.)</font><br>
[Fri Sep 30 19:15:11 2005] : <B>(2) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>(Not as bad as Whitefish Bay, though, where the cops killed a kid... but that's another story.)</font><br>
[Fri Sep 30 19:15:20 2005] : <B>(2) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>(Aquitted on all charges, of course.)</font><br>
[Fri Sep 30 19:15:47 2005] : <B>(2) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>Anyway, Clover District, the people were poor due to a variety of poor decisions; then were penned in by the fear of their neighbors.</font><br>
[Fri Sep 30 19:16:14 2005] : <B>(3) Rien</B>: <font color='#004040'>(Interesting... sounds like the higher police presence in places like Springvale, Redfern and Doveton over here.)</font><br>
[Fri Sep 30 19:16:15 2005] : <B>(2) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>Now if there's one thing the Dragonhunt world doesn't lack, it's charismatic and powerful leaders. So naturally, diverse tribes of gangs sprang up.</font><br>
[Fri Sep 30 19:17:03 2005] : <B>(2) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>Mia makes a big point of how specialized some of them are -- like the Cutthroat Raiders, who pilot barges with concealed cannons, right up the river in the middle of the city, to bombard enemy gangs' condos.</font><br>
[Fri Sep 30 19:17:40 2005] : <B>(2) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>And how advanced some of them are: you can buy locally-printed histories of the Clover District, each reflecting favorably on the publishing gang.</font><br>
[Fri Sep 30 19:18:05 2005] : <B>(2) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>They even run schools, which teach horribly twisted values in addition to basic reading and math.</font><br>
[Fri Sep 30 19:18:46 2005] : <B>(2) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>Each gang produces a "GDP," -- they cheerfully take the language of nations -- of which they tithe to the Lawbringers, the most powerful and most impartial gang.</font><br>
[Fri Sep 30 19:19:09 2005] : <B>(2) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>The Lawbringers enforce the rules established between the gangs; they do not particularly assist the non-gang citizenry.</font><br>
[Fri Sep 30 19:19:31 2005] : <B>(2) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>Markets and other public places are usually guaranteed as safe by the Lawbringers.</font><br>
[Fri Sep 30 19:19:47 2005] : <B>(2) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>And you can hire a Lawbringer escort, which can immunize you against most gang activity.</font><br>
[Fri Sep 30 19:20:00 2005] : <B>(2) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>As long as you're happy with a percentage of the fee going straight to the gangs you're protected against.</font><br>
[Fri Sep 30 19:20:19 2005] : <B>(4) Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>Heh. Nice setup.</font><br>
[Fri Sep 30 19:20:40 2005] : <B>(1) Aryk</B>: <font color='#000080'>(brb laundry)</font><br>
[Fri Sep 30 19:20:43 2005] : <B>(2) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>You can buy a "Globe Pass" from them, for a great sum, which makes you immune to crime anywhere within the District.</font><br>
[Fri Sep 30 19:21:24 2005] : <B>(2) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>Mia points out that even that pass has limits, so don't beg for trouble... but most people will see the pass and decide that mugging you isn't worth seven weeks of ritual torture before a slow death.</font><br>
[Fri Sep 30 19:21:43 2005] : <B>(2) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>Half the price of the Globe Pass is used to maintain the torture implements.</font><br>
[Fri Sep 30 19:21:46 2005] : <B>(2) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>Cute, isn't it?</font><br>
[Fri Sep 30 19:21:58 2005] : <B>(3) Rien</B>: <font color='#004040'>sounds a hellishly delightful place</font><br>
[Fri Sep 30 19:22:05 2005] : <B>(2) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>The two most powerful gangs are the Templars and the Silver Blades.</font><br>
[Fri Sep 30 19:22:32 2005] : <B>(2) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>(Well, Adrian, they just wanted to make damn sure if someone buys immunity from crime, they get what they paid for...)</font><br>
[Fri Sep 30 19:22:50 2005] : <B>(2) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>(And life is so cheap there that it takes a lot to convince someone.)</font><br>
[Fri Sep 30 19:22:56 2005] : <B>(3) Rien</B>: <font color='#004040'>I wasn't talking about that specifically, just the place in general</font><br>
[Fri Sep 30 19:23:22 2005] : <B>(2) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>The Templars are only named that because they make their base in a ruined temple. Used to be angelic, but it's been so trashed that nobody even knows what angel anymore.</font><br>
[Fri Sep 30 19:23:49 2005] : <B>(2) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>Their leaders are called The Voice, identical triplets, clearly inhuman, because every time they are killed, they return again in some form.</font><br>
[Fri Sep 30 19:24:09 2005] : <B>(2) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>They control their population through sheer brutality, harming anyone who disobeys them.</font><br>
[Fri Sep 30 19:24:29 2005] : <B>(2) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>The Voice requires that outrages be limited to a certain number and intensity per block, per year...</font><br>
[Fri Sep 30 19:24:50 2005] : <B>(2) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>Which creates an atmosphere of dread and relief. "Well, there have been X rapes in our building this year... we're safe for now!"</font><br>
[Fri Sep 30 19:24:59 2005] : <B>(2) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>Or "every other block has had murders... we're next."</font><br>
[Fri Sep 30 19:26:01 2005] : <B>(2) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>The extremity of the Templars' crimes has led the government to take an interest in them; but to join the Templars, you have to join in their murderous ways, and no undercover agents are willing to lose their souls to get information.</font><br>
[Fri Sep 30 19:27:09 2005] : <B>(2) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>So it takes a goodly time for the Riskbreakers and intelligence agents to get enough reconnaissance to root out the Templar leadership; and every time there is a purge, and every time Noble Amethyst personally destroys the debased Temple with his explosive breath, the Voice creeps out of the shadows again once the martial law is finally repealed.</font><br>
[Fri Sep 30 19:27:31 2005] : <B>(1) Aryk</B>: <font color='#000080'>(back.  Mostly)</font><br>
[Fri Sep 30 19:27:46 2005] : <B>(2) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>A few people are saved from poverty; but most return to the only life they will ever know.</font><br>
[Fri Sep 30 19:27:57 2005] : <B>(2) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>The Silver Blades is the other most powerful gang.</font><br>
[Fri Sep 30 19:28:12 2005] : <B>(2) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>They are less violent, but no less foul: they are drug dealers.</font><br>
[Fri Sep 30 19:28:34 2005] : <B>(2) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>For a long time, they were simply luxury vendors, providing a simple escape; but with the discovery of Glitter, they have come to be a powerful force.</font><br>
[Fri Sep 30 19:28:46 2005] : <B>(2) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>They were the first to exploit its powerful addiction to control people as slaves.</font><br>
[Fri Sep 30 19:28:55 2005] : <B>(3) Rien</B>: <font color='#004040'>I thought Glitter hadn't infiltrated the Silver Coast</font><br>
[Fri Sep 30 19:29:04 2005] : <B>(4) Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>No, it just hasn't gotten to Ilium.</font><br>
[Fri Sep 30 19:29:09 2005] : <B>(4) Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>In large part thanks to us.</font><br>
[Fri Sep 30 19:29:11 2005] : <B>(3) Rien</B>: <font color='#004040'>oh, okay</font><br>
