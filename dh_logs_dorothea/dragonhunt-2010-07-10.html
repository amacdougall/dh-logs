[Sat Jul 10 18:03:17 2010] : <b>(1658) Alan</b>: <font color='#00008c'>Hey, cool!</font><br />
[Sat Jul 10 18:03:20 2010] : <b>(1659) Rien</b>: <font color='#263607'>Calculations show that between the three jobs I've worked in the past financial year I've paid enough tax to offset my contracting work, and actually get a refund, so I don't need to spend the money I saved to pay the tax on my contracting gig.</font><br />
[Sat Jul 10 18:03:30 2010] : <b>(1658) Alan</b>: <font color='#00008c'>Awesome.</font><br />
[Sat Jul 10 18:03:41 2010] : <b>(1660) Renate</b>: <font color='#000080'>nice!</font><br />

[Sat Jul 10 18:04:34 2010] : <b>(1658) Alan</b>: <font color='#00008c'>Also I'm eating a prickly pear. And I've got nopalitos in the fridge. Decided to do a cactus experiment.</font><br />

[Sat Jul 10 18:12:19 2010] : <b>(1659) Rien</b>: <font color='#263607'>We do!  But it's desert we're very protective of.  Non-native plant-life has a bad habit of spreading like wildfire over here, so we try to keep it largely out.</font><br />
[Sat Jul 10 18:12:39 2010] : <b>(1658) Alan</b>: <font color='#00008c'>Well, the prickly pear was good -- mild and refreshing, beet-colored soft red flesh with lots of juice -- but it's full of unchewable seeds you have to swallow or spit out.</font><br />
[Sat Jul 10 18:12:44 2010] : <b>(1658) Alan</b>: <font color='#00008c'>Not really worth it IMO.</font><br />
[Sat Jul 10 18:13:05 2010] : <b>(1660) Renate</b>: <font color='#000080'>do you eat watermelon?</font><br />

[Sat Jul 10 18:14:28 2010] : <b>(1658) Alan</b>: <font color='#00008c'>So far, my favorite cactus product is still tequila. Of course, that'll be a hard throne to claim.</font><br />

[Sat Jul 10 18:39:27 2010] : <b>(1658) Alan</b>: <font color='#00008c'>Over a few seconds, the mending potion sends spikes of heat down her legs, pulling things back into place, tightening pulled ligaments, setting bones.</font><br />
[Sat Jul 10 18:40:13 2010] : <b>(1660) Renate</b>: <font color='#000080'>Her lip is bleeding, from where she has bitten it to keep from crying out. There is no need to distract Rien and Aryk.</font><br />
[Sat Jul 10 18:40:39 2010] : <b>(1658) Alan</b>: <font color='#00008c'>Meanwhile, Heliomere has entered a tight bank, and at the same time Rien senses him restoring a few defensive spells -- they're powerful but volatile, Rien can't tell at this range just what they are.</font><br />
[Sat Jul 10 18:41:54 2010] : <b>(1658) Alan</b>: <font color='#00008c'>Aryk is fighting the other two fire dragons, clothed in his Armor of Light, trying to keep them both on the same side, so they can't attack him at once.</font><br />
[Sat Jul 10 18:42:22 2010] : <b>(1658) Alan</b>: <font color='#00008c'>What's Rien hitting Heliomere with?</font><br />
[Sat Jul 10 18:42:27 2010] : <b>(1658) Alan</b>: <font color='#00008c'>He's probably a bowshot away.</font><br />
[Sat Jul 10 18:42:49 2010] : <b>(1658) Alan</b>: <font color='#00008c'>Back in the old days, his spells didn't reach that far, but he's grown a lot since then.</font><br />
[Sat Jul 10 18:43:25 2010] : <b>(1659) Rien</b>: <font color='#263607'>Pure demonic force.  Time for something he hasn't used so far in this fight.</font><br />
[Sat Jul 10 18:45:03 2010] : <b>(1658) Alan</b>: <font color='#00008c'>All right. The black bolt reflects from Heliomere's back, rebounding right at Rien's chest. He can dodge most of its force -- though not all -- if he gives up his tactical position and altitude.</font><br />
[Sat Jul 10 18:45:18 2010] : <b>(1658) Alan</b>: <font color='#00008c'>One of Heliomere's two defenses is consumed; it looks like it was a one-time reflect.</font><br />
[Sat Jul 10 18:45:50 2010] : <b>(1660) Renate</b>: <font color='#000080'>(moral: test defenses first, THEN hit him)</font><br />
[Sat Jul 10 18:46:07 2010] : <b>(1658) Alan</b>: <font color='#00008c'>But like most powerful dragons, he casts spells by mere thought, faster than any mortal mage. Rien is sure he can't pressure him alone.</font><br />
[Sat Jul 10 18:46:37 2010] : <b>(1658) Alan</b>: <font color='#00008c'>The other dragons on the field are weak; Aryk is quite credibly holding off Granton and The Unstoppable Force, even exhausted as he is.</font><br />
[Sat Jul 10 18:46:42 2010] : <b>(1658) Alan</b>: <font color='#00008c'>But Heliomere is the real deal.</font><br />
[Sat Jul 10 18:48:13 2010] : <b>(1659) Rien</b>: <font color='#263607'>So fly towards him and Slice the defenses away, take whatever lumps he has to (or can't dispell with his sword)</font><br />
[Sat Jul 10 18:49:06 2010] : <b>(1658) Alan</b>: <font color='#00008c'>Does that mean that Rien won't try to avoid the effects of the reflected spell?</font><br />
[Sat Jul 10 18:49:49 2010] : <b>(1658) Alan</b>: <font color='#00008c'>He knows it won't kill him, but it'll be a serious wound, requiring him to take an action to drink a potion soon.</font><br />
[Sat Jul 10 18:50:03 2010] : <b>(1658) Alan</b>: <font color='#00008c'>Or risk being knocked over by a proverbial feather.</font><br />
[Sat Jul 10 18:51:03 2010] : <b>(1658) Alan</b>: <font color='#00008c'>The field over by Aryk is covered in black smoke for a moment; either Holmstock is doing something, or some fire breath backfired.</font><br />

[Sat Jul 10 18:57:06 2010] : <b>(1659) Rien</b>: <font color='#263607'>Rien will try and raise a barrier against the blast, then race forward and try to destroy the last barrier.</font><br />
[Sat Jul 10 18:58:00 2010] : <b>(1658) Alan</b>: <font color='#00008c'>Well, the reflected shot comes almost instantaneously; Rien has no time to try to use more magic. I'm afraid all he can do is take it on the chest, or dodge the worst of it and be unable to close in on Heliomere.</font><br />
[Sat Jul 10 18:58:26 2010] : <b>(1658) Alan</b>: <font color='#00008c'>If he takes the hit, he can get to grips with Heliomere by intercepting his turn.</font><br />
[Sat Jul 10 19:00:50 2010] : <b>(1659) Rien</b>: <font color='#263607'>He'll take it, then, and intercept Heliomere, engage, strike, then disengage and heal.</font><br />
[Sat Jul 10 19:00:57 2010] : <b>(1658) Alan</b>: <font color='#00008c'>Granton has burst up out of the black smoke, flying up and away; so has Aryk, sword on fire echoing ethereal wings, but Aryk falls back into the smoke with a downward slash that dispels it in a column of fire.</font><br />
[Sat Jul 10 19:01:55 2010] : <b>(1658) Alan</b>: <font color='#00008c'>The Unstoppable Force is seen in the center, stopped at least for a moment by a wound on his brow like the kerf from a woodcutter's axe.</font><br />

[Sat Jul 10 19:06:05 2010] : <b>(1658) Alan</b>: <font color='#00008c'>That'll be one move; then hitting him will be another. Meanwhile, Heliomere can cast two spells to each one of Rien's. Rien will be a distraction, but only if you combine your forces can he be threatened again.</font><br />

[Sat Jul 10 19:09:37 2010] : <b>(1658) Alan</b>: <font color='#00008c'>They're too far away to sense, but from Rien's vantage point, Renate can see what's going on with Cardiff's men -- they're in a standoff with another armed group to the north.</font><br />
[Sat Jul 10 19:10:26 2010] : <b>(1659) Rien</b>: <font color='#263607'>Rien will Slice Heliomere's defenses, then disappear into the Mirror Realm to heal.</font><br />
[Sat Jul 10 19:10:41 2010] : <b>(1660) Renate</b>: <font color='#000080'>Argh. I can guess who. Nothing she can do about it right now. She heads for the Unstoppable Force, her goal to do as much damage as possible in as little time as possible.</font><br />
[Sat Jul 10 19:10:58 2010] : <b>(1660) Renate</b>: <font color='#000080'>So a lot of Fate Duel, some Quicksand if it looks like he's getting frisky, Jet Counter, etc.</font><br />
[Sat Jul 10 19:11:44 2010] : <b>(1660) Renate</b>: <font color='#000080'>(I hope at least one or two of Cardiff's forces survive. She needs to find the two women they kidnapped from Margolin.)</font><br />
[Sat Jul 10 19:11:45 2010] : <b>(1658) Alan</b>: <font color='#00008c'>Aryk is about to help, but Larahk explodes out of the ground on the other side of him, snatching him up in dirt-stained ivory claws.</font><br />
[Sat Jul 10 19:13:00 2010] : <b>(1658) Alan</b>: <font color='#00008c'>Aryk immediately escapes by using a move Renate has only seen a few times before -- he flings his arms wide as a fiery shockwave ripples out from him, knocking the dragon back, and Holmstock reaches to the sky to draw down an extra infusion of holy power.</font><br />
[Sat Jul 10 19:14:04 2010] : <b>(1658) Alan</b>: <font color='#00008c'>Now Aryk is a spitting sparkler. He has another half a minute, maybe more, of power, and then he'll go dead and be just a tough guy with a sword. But it might just be enough.</font><br />
[Sat Jul 10 19:15:25 2010] : <b>(1659) Rien</b>: <font color='#263607'>(Distracted, just got an on-call alert from work)</font><br />
[Sat Jul 10 19:16:05 2010] : <b>(1658) Alan</b>: <font color='#00008c'>By the way, less than a minute has passed since Adam's forces plowed into Heliomere's mostly-zombie army, so don't judge him too harshly; he's riding toward Aryk and Renate now, four angels at his back.</font><br />
[Sat Jul 10 19:16:21 2010] : <b>(1658) Alan</b>: <font color='#00008c'>Remember that each "round" is only ten seconds.</font><br />
[Sat Jul 10 19:16:52 2010] : <b>(1658) Alan</b>: <font color='#00008c'>Which is why stuff like "this dragon is turning around" means I've been ignoring the dragon for three rounds at a time.</font><br />
[Sat Jul 10 19:17:59 2010] : <b>(1660) Renate</b>: <font color='#000080'>(yup, it's fine :P )</font><br />
[Sat Jul 10 19:18:15 2010] : <b>(1658) Alan</b>: <font color='#00008c'>It's also why Emily's just now gotten back; and who knows how she managed to round up even a few dozen people in five minutes, much less convinced them to pepper Jenson Cardiff's men with hunting arrows.</font><br />
[Sat Jul 10 19:18:41 2010] : <b>(1660) Renate</b>: <font color='#000080'>(Renate has a certain amount of respect for Emily's abilities.)</font><br />
[Sat Jul 10 19:18:50 2010] : <b>(1660) Renate</b>: <font color='#000080'>(She's impressed, but not surprised!)</font><br />
[Sat Jul 10 19:19:19 2010] : <b>(1658) Alan</b>: <font color='#00008c'>They wouldn't be doing so well if it weren't for Emily herself running hither and yon among Cardiff's men, Myra fully manifested and covering her back, wreaking what destruction she can.</font><br />
[Sat Jul 10 19:22:06 2010] : <b>(1658) Alan</b>: <font color='#00008c'>Renate is wearing out the last of the Unstoppable Force's vitality quite effectively; the dragon isn't able to regain his senses, and Renate can easily predict and avoid his thrashes and lunges.</font><br />
[Sat Jul 10 19:22:33 2010] : <b>(1658) Alan</b>: <font color='#00008c'>The occasional gout of fire is easily dodged by vaulting over the dragon's neck.</font><br />
[Sat Jul 10 19:23:38 2010] : <b>(1660) Renate</b>: <font color='#000080'>Good. Kill him. If she can get through his skull via the wound Aryk made, that should be that.</font><br />
[Sat Jul 10 19:26:02 2010] : <b>(1658) Alan</b>: <font color='#00008c'>Heliomere is gliding down to rescue his beleagured minions, but Adam has gotten close enough to lend a hand: "True King, hear my prayer!" he cries. "Shield us from those in the sky!" Not too different from a standard Church spell -- just in the vernacular.</font><br />
[Sat Jul 10 19:28:08 2010] : <b>(1658) Alan</b>: <font color='#00008c'>And whether Adam is running the show, or his True King, his plea succeeds: the air two meters above you shimmers for a moment and becomes solid as glass. Heliomere fires a dozen pinwheels of blue light down at Renate, but they skitter harmlessly along the top of the conjured field.</font><br />
[Sat Jul 10 19:28:52 2010] : <b>(1660) Renate</b>: <font color='#000080'>Renate is grateful, but rather busy; she saves thanks for later, all her attention on the dragon she is trying to kill.</font><br />

[Sat Jul 10 19:29:47 2010] : <b>(1658) Alan</b>: <font color='#00008c'>The dragon has been slashing at Aryk with huge curved claws, but Aryk's Armor of Light has repelled every blow; during his Hero Rush, he is virtually invulnerable.</font><br />
[Sat Jul 10 19:29:50 2010] : <b>(1660) Renate</b>: <font color='#000080'>"Well, I want -- a pony -- but --" Renate is a bit winded. "I don't -- exactly -- need it -- just now!"</font><br />
[Sat Jul 10 19:30:52 2010] : <b>(1658) Alan</b>: <font color='#00008c'>Larakh breathes an explosive wave of fine dust, which expands, pushing away everything near it... except Aryk, who leaves an Aryk-shaped hole in it as he charges through with a Burning Shield.</font><br />
[Sat Jul 10 19:34:05 2010] : <b>(1659) Rien</b>: <font color='#263607'>(Phew... those things are intense)</font><br />
[Sat Jul 10 19:34:25 2010] : <b>(1658) Alan</b>: <font color='#00008c'>With Adam and Aryk running interference for her, Renate has a free hand; finally, she's able to close in and open an artery in The Unstoppable Force's throat. The dragon has finally recovered his composure enough to begin casting healing spells, but it's too late -- Renate's final blow forces him into an instinctive panic. He's done for.</font><br />
[Sat Jul 10 19:35:31 2010] : <b>(1658) Alan</b>: <font color='#00008c'>Meanwhile, Aryk yells, "All up to you in a second... Guardian Legend!"</font><br />
[Sat Jul 10 19:35:52 2010] : <b>(1660) Renate</b>: <font color='#000080'>Renate makes absolutely sure of this -- dragons are ridiculously resilient -- then runs for Larakh, to help her brother.</font><br />
[Sat Jul 10 19:36:04 2010] : <b>(1658) Alan</b>: <font color='#00008c'>Aryk and Holmstock hit Larakh from both flanks, moving in a blur; Holmstock is using a smoking scimitar that burns like an ember.</font><br />
[Sat Jul 10 19:37:25 2010] : <b>(1658) Alan</b>: <font color='#00008c'>Aryk slashes upward with immense power, knocking the massive dragon sprawling; Holmstock swings and hammers the dragon back to the ground.</font><br />

[Sat Jul 10 19:38:06 2010] : <b>(1658) Alan</b>: <font color='#00008c'>Finally, the two seem to dash <i>through</i> the dragon, crossing paths at the center, and then Larakh suffers an internal explosion that makes his body shake.</font><br />
[Sat Jul 10 19:38:25 2010] : <b>(1658) Alan</b>: <font color='#00008c'>Smoke billows from the dragon's mouth as he regains his feet, baying in pain.</font><br />

[Sat Jul 10 19:41:38 2010] : <b>(1658) Alan</b>: <font color='#00008c'>Heliomere is flying past Renate and Aryk; Rien sees that they're shielded by a huge circular disc of solidified air, and Adam is down near them.</font><br />
