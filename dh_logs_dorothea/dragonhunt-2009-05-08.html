[Fri May  8 23:44:05 2009] : <b>(26435) The Empress</b>: <font color='#000080'>Viviana catches Bernard's eye and nods once. She is in accord with his recommendation.</font><br />
[Fri May  8 23:44:17 2009] : <b>(26439) Alan</b>: <font color='#000080'>The aide relays some orders, and the signal is sent; this is pre-tellstone, but there is a much greater use of whisper spells, because almost all elves know a little magic.</font><br />
[Fri May  8 23:45:36 2009] : <b>(26439) Alan</b>: <font color='#000080'>(Not knowing the cantrips to whisper at, say, city range, is like not having a cell phone. Longer-range communication still takes mail or better magic.)</font><br />
[Fri May  8 23:46:05 2009] : <b>(26439) Alan</b>: <font color='#000080'>(On the other hand, average folks run out of magic power if they just jabber all day. :))</font><br />
[Fri May  8 23:46:56 2009] : <b>(26437) Noemi</b>: <font color='#710000'>The demon lands next to the exhausted Noemi.  "This is boring.  I think I'll kill you and go play somewhere else."  "Mm.  I think not," Noemi replies, smirking beside herself.  Suddenly she smashes her staff on the ground, the crystal shattering.  The demon shrieks, and then explodes.</font><br />
[Fri May  8 23:47:03 2009] : <b>(26434) Tristan Laurent</b>: <font color='#003300'>(Well, Tristan officially has a headache now.  Turns out this mental spellcasting is more taxing that usual.  But it was his first time, so what the hey.)</font><br />
[Fri May  8 23:47:42 2009] : <b>(26435) The Empress</b>: <font color='#000080'>If the stresses of battle have had any effect at all on Viviana, the effect is not visible. She stands tall and haughty as ever, waiting.</font><br />
[Fri May  8 23:48:06 2009] : <b>(26439) Alan</b>: <font color='#000080'>The triumphant Knight-Lieutenant enters from the staircase; it's bad manners to fly to the Empress. He kneels, "Knight-Lieutenant Alexandre Rousseau, Imperial Strikers, 3rd Division, 11th Century, reporting."</font><br />
[Fri May  8 23:48:35 2009] : <font color='#008000'>** (26437) Noemi <font color='#008000'>approaches the Empress, and kneels beside Rousseau.</font> **</font><br />
[Fri May  8 23:48:40 2009] : <b>(26435) The Empress</b>: <font color='#000080'>"Rise, Knight-Lieutenant." Nothing can be gleaned from her tone of voice.</font><br />
[Fri May  8 23:48:43 2009] : <b>(26435) The Empress</b>: <font color='#000080'>"And you as well."</font><br />
[Fri May  8 23:48:51 2009] : <font color='#008000'>** (26437) Noemi <font color='#008000'>does so.</font> **</font><br />
[Fri May  8 23:49:24 2009] : <b>(26434) Tristan Laurent</b>: <font color='#003300'>Tristan is rubbing his temple, trying to quiet the thumping in his head; despite that, though, he can't keep the soft chuckle from rising inside him.  He did it, finally.</font><br />
[Fri May  8 23:49:26 2009] : <b>(26439) Alan</b>: <font color='#000080'>He clearly resists glancing up at the monarch, but as he entered the room he did do a very brief gawk at Michael, who now floats before the prayermasters, speaking with them in low tones.</font><br />
[Fri May  8 23:50:03 2009] : <b>(26435) The Empress</b>: <font color='#000080'>Tristan earns a brief, disapproving glance from the Empress, whose disapproving glances can burn flesh off the unwary.</font><br />
[Fri May  8 23:50:23 2009] : <b>(26439) Alan</b>: <font color='#000080'>(She's not so different from Renate after all, then!)</font><br />
[Fri May  8 23:51:01 2009] : <b>(26434) Tristan Laurent</b>: <font color='#003300'>Even that doesn't stop him, his eyes not focused on anything here and now.</font><br />
[Fri May  8 23:51:45 2009] : <b>(26439) Alan</b>: <font color='#000080'>(Brb.)</font><br />
[Fri May  8 23:53:58 2009] : <font color='#008000'>** (26437) Noemi <font color='#008000'>takes that moment to cast a disapproving glance at Rousseau, as well, though she's too tired to give one with the same ferocity.</font> **</font><br />
[Fri May  8 23:54:23 2009] : <b>(26435) The Empress</b>: <font color='#000080'>(Taller. Much more beautiful. And actually DOES burn flesh off people. Ren only looks as though she'd like to. *g*)</font><br />
[Fri May  8 23:54:24 2009] : <b>(26439) Alan</b>: <font color='#000080'>(Back.)</font><br />
[Fri May  8 23:54:40 2009] : <b>(26435) The Empress</b>: <font color='#000080'>(But yes, both are hyperaware of protocol.)</font><br />
[Fri May  8 23:55:09 2009] : <b>(26439) Alan</b>: <font color='#000080'>Rousseau awaits the Empress's pleasure with mixed trepidation and elation. He is still breathing heavily, but trying to control it.</font><br />
[Fri May  8 23:55:44 2009] : <b>(26439) Alan</b>: <font color='#000080'>His armor is broken, and the naked skin beneath is unmarked, but smeared with blood; he took and healed several wounds.</font><br />
[Fri May  8 23:56:13 2009] : <b>(26435) The Empress</b>: <font color='#000080'>Viviana nods fractionally at Bernard. The Empress does not commend mere Knight-Lieutenants, no matter how beautiful they are, nor how important the battle they saved.</font><br />
[Fri May  8 23:56:20 2009] : <b>(26434) Tristan Laurent</b>: <font color='#003300'>(And Tristan's an absent-minded kooky genius.  Eccentric, to say the least.  He normally tries to hold himself up in perfect protocol while in the presence of the Empress, though... he's simply distracted by thoughts of what he can do now.)</font><br />
[Fri May  8 23:58:13 2009] : <b>(26439) Alan</b>: <font color='#000080'>He is a fine-looking elf, exemplary in fact -- no more handsome than most (there are no unattractive elves), but fit of form, well-groomed, and has the jewel-deep blue eyes and sweeping eyebrows prized by his race.</font><br />
[Fri May  8 23:58:24 2009] : <b>(26439) Alan</b>: <font color='#000080'>His skin is pale, his hair white.</font><br />
[Fri May  8 23:59:01 2009] : <b>(26439) Alan</b>: <font color='#000080'>Pascal Bernard was aware of the protocol, but the protocol also involves deferring to the Empress at every turn just in case.</font><br />
[Fri May  8 23:59:22 2009] : <b>(26435) The Empress</b>: <font color='#000080'>(Yep. He just got Imperial Dispensation.)</font><br />
[Fri May  8 23:59:59 2009] : <b>(26439) Alan</b>: <font color='#000080'>"Knight-Lieutenant Rousseau. Report in brief. Begin with the moment you decided to strike directly against the enemy leader."</font><br />
