[Sat Nov 13 20:56:07 2010] : <b>(5822) Rien</b>: <font color='#263607'>Freeze the metal, then give it a short, sharp earth shock, I should think.</font><br />
[Sat Nov 13 20:56:39 2010] : <b>(5832) Alan</b>: <font color='#000080'>From a game balance perspective, locks are important. I don't want to have to say "okay, so the door is locked <i>and</i> magically reinforced. No, no, <i>super</i> magic."</font><br />
[Sat Nov 13 20:57:22 2010] : <b>(5832) Alan</b>: <font color='#000080'>Also, good idea. To do this sort of small-scale stuff, Rien has to really focus on what he's doing and take time to get it right, but about half a minute later, the padlock has shattered and fallen away.</font><br />

[Sat Nov 13 20:58:43 2010] : <b>(5832) Alan</b>: <font color='#000080'>Hm, learning actual lockpicking would be a perfectly reasonable and useful hobby for Rien to have.</font><br />

The journal is uninformative -- it's written almost entirely in a personal code, not a breakable cypher but a cryptic set of phrases that requires prior knowledge. "15 Seventh 98," a representative entry goes. "Two larks. Saw Lambda for items G and Y. Prices are atrocious here, but cash has been plentiful. 1500 in the evening."

[Sat Nov 13 21:13:48 2010] : <b>(5832) Alan</b>: <font color='#000080'>The letters, on the other hand, are juicy -- you can track Heliomere's plans leading up to the attack on the plainsmen, which he thinks will be a "quick conquest" leading to a month-long period of "demonstrating our authority" followed by "the swift absorption of the nearby towns." Only the "insane druid" presents a "pothole in the road ahead."</font><br />

"The barons of Margolin, Carrackshire, and Birch Creek will expect a lightning attack on their own lands. They will not be expecting to play the game of kings against Brosford. Their personal power is great, and well-tested -- they killed Boiling Sky, lest you forget. But they have not proven that they can win a protracted war against a greater economic power."</font><br />
