[Fri Jan 13 21:10:31 2006] : <B>(3) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>"For a given value of 'world,'" the hobgoblin amends amiably. "Your young female companion, I am told, has become the unwitting victim of a simple misunderstanding. I hope we can amicably resolve the same."</font><br>

[Fri Jan 13 21:10:55 2006] : <B>(3) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>He reaches into a pocket of his tailcoat, and slowly, non-threateningly, pulls out a wooden soundcube box.</font><br>

[Fri Jan 13 21:13:00 2006] : <B>(3) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>"Quite simple: the box will not contain a soundcube. What it does contain, my client has refrained from telling me."</font><br>
