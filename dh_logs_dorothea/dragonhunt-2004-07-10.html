[Sat Jul 10 23:14:24 2004] : <B>Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>You write the story. The <i>Daily Fate</i> is a newspaper of record; its editorial voice is as close to reasoned as possible.</font><br>
[Sat Jul 10 23:14:38 2004] : <B>Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>Okay.</font><br>
[Sat Jul 10 23:14:54 2004] : <B>Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>When a political bias is inescapable, they lean to the conservative, while enforcing a thorough treatment of conflicting viewpoints.</font><br>

[Sat Jul 10 23:15:27 2004] : <B>Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>They have one aspect that may interest you -- when a "conflicting viewpoint" is a distinctly minority view, they tend to leave it out.</font><br>

[Sat Jul 10 23:17:25 2004] : <B>Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>The principle of the "minority viewpoint" doesn't apply to this. But let's take an example of, hmm, you know how when a real-world newspaper is reporting something that's pure common sense?</font><br>
[Sat Jul 10 23:17:29 2004] : <B>Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>yup</font><br>
[Sat Jul 10 23:17:41 2004] : <B>Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>And they always have some quote from an "expert" making a claim nobody believes?</font><br>

[Sat Jul 10 23:18:11 2004] : <B>Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>Like an article about string theory or something, where they softpedal the twenty-year vet in favor of the charismatic visionary.</font><br>
