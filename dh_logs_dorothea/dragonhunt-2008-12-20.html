[Sat Dec 20 09:06:47 2008] : <b>(20103) Rien</b>: <font color='#003300'>Yeah.  The thing that still bugs me is that getting up this late for the game is starting to turn what should be a recreational activity into something of a chore.</font><br />
[Sat Dec 20 09:09:13 2008] : <b>(20104) Alan</b>: <font color='#000080'>Well, we were talking about that last week.</font><br />

[Sat Dec 20 09:12:27 2008] : <b>(20106) Aryk</b>: <font color='#710000'>Not much.  Got much snow in NY?</font><br />
[Sat Dec 20 09:14:17 2008] : <b>(20104) Alan</b>: <font color='#000080'>Ugh. Worse. Tons of big fluffy pollutiony snow, followed by sleet, followed by rain. Which then all froze.</font><br />
[Sat Dec 20 09:14:36 2008] : <b>(20104) Alan</b>: <font color='#000080'>At every street corner, there was a river of slush with little ice floes on it, seriously, like something out of National Geographic.</font><br />

[Sat Dec 20 09:16:37 2008] : <b>(20104) Alan</b>: <font color='#000080'>New York snow removal is actually kind of crappy at the municipal level, too. Main streets get plowed, but everything else just gets packed down by the weight of thousands of passing feet or shoveled by the adjacent businesses.</font><br />
[Sat Dec 20 09:16:46 2008] : <b>(20104) Alan</b>: <font color='#000080'>You're in worse shape than us, then.</font><br />
[Sat Dec 20 09:16:58 2008] : <b>(20104) Alan</b>: <font color='#000080'>Less immediately miserable, more long-term winteriness.</font><br />
[Sat Dec 20 09:17:13 2008] : <b>(20105) Renate</b>: <font color='#000080'>In fact, after this I should probably go hit the store.</font><br />

[Sat Dec 20 09:18:07 2008] : <b>(20104) Alan</b>: <font color='#000080'>Hey Matt. Remember how Dave and Kim stayed with me for nine months? I'd put it out of my head, but apparently the burden of gratitude moved them to get me a PS3 for Christmas.</font><br />
[Sat Dec 20 09:18:15 2008] : <b>(20106) Aryk</b>: <font color='#710000'>It was a journey yesterday.  After two hours of snow removal I walked to the store, since our roads weren't driveable.  </font><br />

[Sat Dec 20 09:18:31 2008] : <b>(20104) Alan</b>: <font color='#000080'>Any recommendations? Already played GTA3, Gameflied a batch of other stuff, borrowing Valkyria Chronicles.</font><br />

[Sat Dec 20 09:19:16 2008] : <b>(20104) Alan</b>: <font color='#000080'>I mean GTA4 of course.</font><br />
[Sat Dec 20 09:19:48 2008] : <b>(20106) Aryk</b>: <font color='#710000'>I got the demo of Valkyria Chronicles.  It's a blast.  Also, Soul Calibur 4, Tiger Woods, Little Big Planet (a must)</font><br />

[Sat Dec 20 09:20:14 2008] : <b>(20106) Aryk</b>: <font color='#710000'>Metal Gear.</font><br />
[Sat Dec 20 09:20:19 2008] : <b>(20104) Alan</b>: <font color='#000080'>Ah, you're here. So, about sending Rien on his own thing; we could have a separate session for an hour here or there, some time that works better for you.</font><br />
[Sat Dec 20 09:20:40 2008] : <b>(20104) Alan</b>: <font color='#000080'>Played MGS4. Satisfying in my parts, but Jesus Kojima is insane.</font><br />
[Sat Dec 20 09:20:50 2008] : <b>(20104) Alan</b>: <font color='#000080'>It's worth playing just to see what a game designed by a schizophrenic is like.</font><br />

[Sat Dec 20 09:21:39 2008] : <b>(20104) Alan</b>: <font color='#000080'>Oh, I don't even care about that. It's a Metal Gear Solid game, you expect extremely long cinematics.</font><br />

[Sat Dec 20 09:23:31 2008] : <b>(20103) Rien</b>: <font color='#003300'>Fantastic...</font><br />

[Sat Dec 20 09:24:45 2008] : <b>(20106) Aryk</b>: <font color='#710000'>I could do Friday nights at about midnight my time.  But that's probably when Alan is still out doing his nightlife thing.</font><br />

[Sat Dec 20 11:02:33 2008] : <b>(20104) Alan</b>: <font color='#000080'>Almost in unison, the two swordbearers lift their heads from their hunched noodle-slurping posture and snap around to focus on Renate.

[Sat Dec 20 11:02:56 2008] : <b>(20106) Aryk</b>: <font color='#710000'>(brb)</font><br />

[Sat Dec 20 11:03:27 2008] : <b>(20104) Alan</b>: <font color='#000080'>She wouldn't recognize him by mental signs anyway; last she met him, she didn't have the same powers. Rien, however, immediately marks him as Vansander deLeon; and Renate's own danger sense starts tingling sharply.</font><br />
[Sat Dec 20 11:03:43 2008] : <b>(20104) Alan</b>: <font color='#000080'>Something here is not remotely right.</font><br />
[Sat Dec 20 11:03:53 2008] : <b>(20105) Renate</b>: <font color='#000080'>She stands quietly; there is no use in panic.</font><br />

[Sat Dec 20 11:05:03 2008] : <b>(20104) Alan</b>: <font color='#000080'>Flick Tarsley starts to get up, then looks at deLeon, who shrugs. Then Flick stands and waves. "Renate! Rien! Good to see you."</font><br />
[Sat Dec 20 11:06:24 2008] : <b>(20104) Alan</b>: <font color='#000080'>DeLeon stands as well, then gives a cautionary scowl and wink at anyone who would dare take his seat.</font><br />

[Sat Dec 20 11:06:48 2008] : <b>(20104) Alan</b>: <font color='#000080'>"My lady," deLeon says with a rough bow. "A pleasure to meet you again."</font><br />
[Sat Dec 20 11:07:18 2008] : <b>(20105) Renate</b>: <font color='#000080'>"I'm sorry, I believe you have the advantage of me," she says pleasantly.</font><br />

[Sat Dec 20 11:11:03 2008] : <b>(20104) Alan</b>: <font color='#000080'>"It has been a worthy trade," Flick says, this time seeming more sincere. "It is truly amazing to see the samurai fighting arts in action."</font><br />
