[Fri Jan  8 18:51:52 2010] : <b>(2010) Alan</b>: <font color='#000080'>Rien remembers how this technique works; an entire area of space takes on a self-healing web of minute changes which serves to impose a local change to the rules of physics.</font><br />
[Fri Jan  8 18:52:34 2010] : <b>(2010) Alan</b>: <font color='#000080'>He just has to figure out what that change is. All the normal constants seem unchanged: speed of light, force of gravity, electrical forces, coefficient of friction.</font><br />

[Fri Jan  8 18:53:01 2010] : <b>(2007) Rien</b>: <font color='#400040'>How about direction of light?  Is the light twisting around a point to hide it?</font><br />
[Fri Jan  8 18:54:59 2010] : <b>(2010) Alan</b>: <font color='#000080'>Good idea. At first, Rien is inclined to say no; but then he realizes that light is not changing direction, but changing its <i>source</i>. When he shines his beam down and to the southwest, the light which returns is slightly different.</font><br />
[Fri Jan  8 18:55:53 2010] : <b>(2010) Alan</b>: <font color='#000080'>Light which shines out through a portal, from somewhere else, has an unearthly quality to it, a different quality for each plane of origin. This is what gave rise to folklore about Chaos light being "unhealthy" or Sacred World light being "golden."</font><br />
[Fri Jan  8 18:56:32 2010] : <b>(2010) Alan</b>: <font color='#000080'>That's because the portals actually change the grouping of photons without changing their overall frequency. It results in tiny shifts in the quality of the light.</font><br />
[Fri Jan  8 18:57:16 2010] : <b>(2010) Alan</b>: <font color='#000080'>That's what's happening to the light reflected from the southwest -- at least, the very few photons that make their way back, because in that direction is just deep black ocean.</font><br />
[Fri Jan  8 18:57:32 2010] : <b>(2010) Alan</b>: <font color='#000080'>The implication is that the light is going into a portal and coming back out.</font><br />
[Fri Jan  8 18:59:52 2010] : <b>(2007) Rien</b>: <font color='#400040'>If Rien can't discern any more from here, he'll climb back up and get them to turn the ship in that direction.  They'll have to triangulate the centre.</font><br />
[Fri Jan  8 19:00:53 2010] : <b>(2010) Alan</b>: <font color='#000080'>All right. It might also help to lower you further; you have probably already set up a system of rope-tugs for that. Maybe there's an additional line hanging down with you that Renate's holding onto.</font><br />

[Fri Jan  8 19:07:09 2010] : <b>(2010) Alan</b>: <font color='#000080'>If Rien keeps going in this direction, he might pass into the other plane himself.</font><br />
[Fri Jan  8 19:07:53 2010] : <b>(2010) Alan</b>: <font color='#000080'>And possibly the ship as well... but it seems like the area of planar "overlay" only compasses ten to fifteen meters up from the ocean floor.</font><br />
[Fri Jan  8 19:08:10 2010] : <b>(2010) Alan</b>: <font color='#000080'>And Rien is hanging at about thirty meters now; the ship is invisible up above him unless he shines the light that way.</font><br />

[Fri Jan  8 20:51:28 2010] : <b>(2020) Alan</b>: <font color='#000080'>Well, the original reason you wanted to get up there was to warn them about Dark Eternal's plan to take over the satellite, but it's no longer at all clear that that's his plan.</font><br />
