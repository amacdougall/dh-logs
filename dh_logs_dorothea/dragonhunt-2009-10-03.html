[Sat Oct 03 09:40:55 2009] : <b>(264) Alan</b>: <font color='#000080'>The night is hot but not stifling; normally the final days of summer set in hot and thick in this part of the country, but here in the forest a constant breeze blows first one way, now the other. To Rien's eye, the cause is obvious: one tree in ten, or twenty, has a simple spell which stirs the wind, work of a local weather-witch. Extrapolating from the angles, he surmises that the wind blows in a great octogram around some point to the north.</font><br />
[Sat Oct 03 09:42:36 2009] : <b>(264) Alan</b>: <font color='#000080'>Renate and Daniel have gone on ahead to Karlbotel; once out of view of the town, Old Wolf proposed a little circuit around it to scout out possible drilling grounds or weapons caches.</font><br />

[Sat Oct 03 10:02:40 2009] : <b>(264) Alan</b>: <font color='#000080'>No; in fact, there does not appear to be active magic on them at all. Instead, they seem to be receiving magic from their surroundings due to some quirk of their structure. Rien's education included a fleeting mention of "low magic" created by crafting normal materials into shapes which just happen to have magical resonance.</font><br />
[Sat Oct 03 10:04:17 2009] : <b>(264) Alan</b>: <font color='#000080'>There's a <i>whole lot</i> to learn about magic, so this particular topic just didn't get much play. All Rien knows is that "barbarian tribes" have "witches" who can weave dolls which have weak magical effects. That seems to be what's going on here.</font><br />
[Sat Oct 03 10:05:10 2009] : <b>(264) Alan</b>: <font color='#000080'>The point is that you don't need natural magical ability to do it. Kind of like "craft alchemy," where you can make all sorts of useful magic potions without being a mage yourself.</font><br />

[Sat Oct 03 10:10:20 2009] : <b>(264) Alan</b>: <font color='#000080'>Or if it is, it's too subtle for Rien to detect; like watching the hour-hand of a clock.</font><br />

[Sat Oct 03 10:11:10 2009] : <b>(264) Alan</b>: <font color='#000080'>Aryk has been hearing a sound for the past few minutes, without really registering it; but finally, he realizes from the unconscious tapping of his toe and bobbing of his head that someone is playing a drum way off in the distance.</font><br />
[Sat Oct 03 10:11:23 2009] : <b>(264) Alan</b>: <font color='#000080'>It's just one, so it's not some distant echo of the party at Glenworth.</font><br />

[Sat Oct 03 10:15:09 2009] : <b>(264) Alan</b>: <font color='#000080'>Sure. You wouldn't even need a stepstool, it's above eye level but not by much.</font><br />
[Sat Oct 03 10:15:39 2009] : <b>(264) Alan</b>: <font color='#000080'>It's just a straw doll. Not even creepy, unless you're eager to be creeped out. Basically a miniature scarecrow.</font><br />
