Well, sir," one of the soldiers says disingenuously, "we're conducting a low-impact operation here, at least as low as possible, so unless your parcel was something that could be used in a battle, I'm sure it would have gone right to its destination."</font><br>

[Fri Apr  7 22:00:31 2006] : <B>(5) Rien</B>: <font color='#004040'>"I need the assistance of your Guild's speciality, Guildmaster.  There are powerful wards in place aorund Skyseek Tower and it's surrounding town.  With them in place, the siege will not move one way or the other, except downhill.  Things are already bad enough for the innocent parties caught in the middle.  Many have no place outside of the town that they could go, and with the occupation in place..."</font><br>
[Fri Apr  7 22:02:00 2006] : <B>(1) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>Barious nods and makes agreeable noises as Rien speaks, drawing out his story.</font><br>

I would not ask such a thing lightly, but, although these are not my people, they are still people, and deserve the chance to live their lives as they will, not as someone else dictates due to wants or desire, or greed."</font><br>
[Fri Apr  7 22:03:46 2006] : <B>(5) Rien</B>: <font color='#004040'>"Oh, yes... and someone I believe you know is working for the other side.  One Keph LoCaine."</font><br>
[Fri Apr  7 22:03:57 2006] : <B>(1) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>Barious's face takes on an expression of grave concern as Rien forms his request.</font><br>

[Fri Apr  7 22:06:26 2006] : <B>(1) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>"Before beginning the siege, we had a series of correspondence on the topic of civil war. She was concerned that her ruler might move against Narristown, but despite the unexpected enemy, the principle&#8212;civil war&#8212;is the same."</font><br>
[Fri Apr  7 22:07:15 2006] : <B>(1) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>"Her proposed strategy was 'psychological operations'&#8212;a style of warfare which minimizes casualties by forcing nonviolent capitulation."</font><br>
[Fri Apr  7 22:08:42 2006] : <B>(1) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>"The last letter I received marked the beginning of the siege. Her plan is to win the siege by promising the defending population food and comfort if they surrender&#8212;not an innovative idea, but still, ruling out a storm offensive is an important step."</font><br>
[Fri Apr  7 22:09:12 2006] : <B>(1) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>"She is convinced that the defenders, since their rebellion is based on humanitarian principles, will surrender before losing many to starvation or illness."</font><br>
[Fri Apr  7 22:09:43 2006] : <B>(1) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>"If I were to assist in a break in the siege, allowing an armed sally, I would be party to many deaths."</font><br>

[Fri Apr  7 22:11:06 2006] : <B>(1) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>He nods. "She was concerned that she would find herself in a power struggle with her second, Major Phillip of Geness, an ex-mercenary."</font><br>

[Fri Apr  7 22:12:15 2006] : <B>(5) Rien</B>: <font color='#004040'>"They are also working with the local brigands, and Keph LoCaine.  I think, Guildmaster, that there's going to be bloodshed no matter how this is resolved.  It has reached that certain point."</font><br>
[Fri Apr  7 22:12:19 2006] : <B>(1) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>"Now. I am concerned by Keph LoCaine's involvement. I am sure that, too, was the handiwork of Phillip of Geness."</font><br>
[Fri Apr  7 22:13:20 2006] : <B>(1) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>"I would provide you with a scroll that can demolish his defenses... if I received your word as a gentleman that you would not use it to scotch the Brigadier's siege."</font><br>
[Fri Apr  7 22:13:57 2006] : <B>(5) Rien</B>: <font color='#004040'>"Can you tell me anything more about this Phillip of Geness?"</font><br>
[Fri Apr  7 22:14:54 2006] : <B>(1) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>"Geness was a town outside of the Ilium province; a fairly prosperous one. But it was destroyed in a war several years ago, razed to the ground."</font><br>
[Fri Apr  7 22:15:18 2006] : <B>(1) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>"Phillip of Geness was a mercenary who operated in the surrounding areas, but called Geness his home. His family lived there."</font><br>
[Fri Apr  7 22:15:52 2006] : <B>(1) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>"I knew him only by reputation, but some of my students served under him on occasion, when I judged his side just."</font><br>
[Fri Apr  7 22:16:08 2006] : <B>(1) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>"Even then, he was unyielding and aggressive."</font><br>
[Fri Apr  7 22:16:48 2006] : <B>(1) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>"After the deaths of his family, he joined the army of Thousand Scales, which certainly provided an outlet for his military attitude."</font><br>
[Fri Apr  7 22:19:01 2006] : <B>(5) Rien</B>: <font color='#004040'>"Hmm... so you think that this is, perhaps, part of a campaign of vengeance, or has he simply found his niche, and is now agressively persuing any way to stay in it?"</font><br>
[Fri Apr  7 22:19:49 2006] : <B>(1) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>"I cannot say. The dragon warlord who led the destruction of Geness was killed only months later, without Phillip's assistance."</font><br>
[Fri Apr  7 22:20:15 2006] : <B>(1) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>"It is possible that some of the mortals responsible ended up with the revolutionary army in Ordillus; but not, I would think, likely."</font><br>
[Fri Apr  7 22:22:46 2006] : <B>(5) Rien</B>: <font color='#004040'>"Perhaps.  So it is he, not the besieged, nor the commander of the besiegers, who you bleieve is seeking to cause bloodshed here?"</font><br>
[Fri Apr  7 22:23:58 2006] : <B>(1) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>"If the besieged commander wants to break the containing spells and launch a magical counteroffensive, it seems he is willing to spend lives as well."</font><br>

I may need to get myself nad my friends out past the commander's defenses quickly, to get those I care for out of the way of anything that may happen.
