[Sat Mar 28 12:18:47 2009] : <b>(24195) Aryk</b>: <font color='#710000'>Heh heh</font><br />
[Sat Mar 28 12:19:26 2009] : <b>(24195) Aryk</b>: <font color='#710000'>Well, that was good.  Kudos again Alan for putting Aryk in a very interesting situation.</font><br />
[Sat Mar 28 12:19:35 2009] : <b>(24195) Aryk</b>: <font color='#710000'>It wasn't what I'd had in mind, but it really worked.</font><br />
[Sat Mar 28 12:19:41 2009] : <b>(24196) Sabra</b>: <font color='#000080'>and it's fun to pick Sabra up every once in a while :)</font><br />
[Sat Mar 28 12:19:53 2009] : <b>(24197) Alan</b>: <font color='#000080'>Demon Lord Aryk would have been pretty awesome though.</font><br />
[Sat Mar 28 12:20:01 2009] : <b>(24195) Aryk</b>: <font color='#710000'>Yeah, she's getting testier every time they meet.</font><br />
[Sat Mar 28 12:20:05 2009] : <b>(24197) Alan</b>: <font color='#000080'>"No, no, you have to be GOOD demons now."</font><br />
[Sat Mar 28 12:20:06 2009] : <b>(24195) Aryk</b>: <font color='#710000'>Yeah, it was tempting.</font><br />
[Sat Mar 28 12:20:07 2009] : <b>(24196) Sabra</b>: <font color='#000080'>She was worried.</font><br />
[Sat Mar 28 12:20:14 2009] : <b>(24197) Alan</b>: <font color='#000080'>Like when Angel took over Wolfram and Hart.</font><br />
[Sat Mar 28 12:20:20 2009] : <b>(24196) Sabra</b>: <font color='#000080'>As soon as they're out she'll settle down.</font><br />
[Sat Mar 28 12:20:25 2009] : <b>(24197) Alan</b>: <font color='#000080'>And had to be like, "no, no, now you're GOOD evil interdimensional lawyers."</font><br />
[Sat Mar 28 12:21:13 2009] : <b>(24195) Aryk</b>: <font color='#710000'>Yeah, but in the end, it all would have backfired on him.  He would have lost the support of Michael and the True King, and that's far more important.</font><br />
[Sat Mar 28 12:21:28 2009] : <b>(24197) Alan</b>: <font color='#000080'>Michael maybe.</font><br />
[Sat Mar 28 12:21:35 2009] : <b>(24195) Aryk</b>: <font color='#710000'>And it wouldn't have made it any easier to bring change to the church.</font><br />
[Sat Mar 28 12:21:44 2009] : <b>(24197) Alan</b>: <font color='#000080'>I think the True King is like, hey, you're trying to be good, it's cool.</font><br />
[Sat Mar 28 12:21:46 2009] : <b>(24196) Sabra</b>: <font color='#000080'>The True King is beyond angels and demons.</font><br />
[Sat Mar 28 12:21:54 2009] : <b>(24197) Alan</b>: <font color='#000080'>Unless you fail!</font><br />
[Sat Mar 28 12:21:59 2009] : <b>(24195) Aryk</b>: <font color='#710000'>Yeah, good point.  But Michael, though.</font><br />
[Sat Mar 28 12:22:14 2009] : <b>(24195) Aryk</b>: <font color='#710000'>And Michael has seen Aryk through this far.  He won't turn his back on that.</font><br />
[Sat Mar 28 12:22:49 2009] : <b>(24195) Aryk</b>: <font color='#710000'>How awesome woud it be though, to redeem Kahan just to move in on his territory.  "Hah!  Sucker!"</font><br />
[Sat Mar 28 12:23:25 2009] : <b>(24195) Aryk</b>: <font color='#710000'>Well, I should get going.  I have lots to get done.  </font><br />
[Sat Mar 28 12:23:34 2009] : <b>(24196) Sabra</b>: <font color='#000080'>Michael's chief virtue is loyalty.</font><br />
[Sat Mar 28 12:23:35 2009] : <b>(24197) Alan</b>: <font color='#000080'>Aight.</font><br />
[Sat Mar 28 12:23:39 2009] : <b>(24196) Sabra</b>: <font color='#000080'>Don't forget that, Aryk.</font><br />
