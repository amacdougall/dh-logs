Rien would really like to start things off by talking to Kander and finding out just who these Druids worship and how to get in contact with them so he can officially ask permission to enter their forest.</font><br />
[Sat Apr 24 00:07:41 2010] : <b>(6844) Alan</b>: <font color='#00008c'>This is an excellent idea.</font><br />

[Sat Apr 24 00:09:45 2010] : <b>(6844) Alan</b>: <font color='#00008c'>Worst case, the situation is such that Renate can be removed from the proceeding if needed.</font><br />
[Sat Apr 24 00:09:57 2010] : <b>(6842) Renate</b>: <font color='#000080'>... that sounds ominous.</font><br />

[Sat Apr 24 00:10:48 2010] : <b>(6844) Alan</b>: <font color='#00008c'>That would have been a jinx, except that I was over getting a glass of water. I was going to say "not to sound ominous or anything..."</font><br />

[Sat Apr 24 00:11:17 2010] : <b>(6842) Renate</b>: <font color='#000080'>But I am also tired and ready to go home.</font><br />
[Sat Apr 24 00:11:20 2010] : <b>(6844) Alan</b>: <font color='#00008c'>I should go visit the ancestral soil some day.</font><br />
[Sat Apr 24 00:12:31 2010] : <b>(6844) Alan</b>: <font color='#00008c'>So. To Kander, it is.</font><br />

[Sat Apr 24 00:15:22 2010] : <b>(6844) Alan</b>: <font color='#00008c'>"Fine gifts you bring me, my friend," Kander says after Rien primes him with clarification of rumors and a few bits of behind-the-scenes information about the events in space.</font><br />

[Sat Apr 24 00:18:23 2010] : <b>(6844) Alan</b>: <font color='#00008c'>Aryk, Emily, and Renate are behind at Aryk's "manor," where Aryk is bringing Renate up to speed on the situation in Carrackshire. He looks very tired for some reason. Funny, Emily doesn't.</font><br />
[Sat Apr 24 00:19:58 2010] : <b>(6842) Renate</b>: <font color='#000080'>Renate very carefully doesn't ask; just behaves as helpfully as she can by way of untying some of the Gordian knots about the place.</font><br />

[Sat Apr 24 00:26:07 2010] : <b>(6844) Alan</b>: <font color='#00008c'>Log off for a moment.</font><br />
[Sat Apr 24 00:26:23 2010] : <b>(6844) Alan</b>: <font color='#00008c'>Dorothea, having watched a bunch of Doctor Who lately, I find myself with more sympathy for Wilmington.</font><br />

[Sat Apr 24 00:26:51 2010] : <b>(6844) Alan</b>: <font color='#00008c'>Let's say you're going about your daily life, and you see the Doctor (and know his history). Assume you want to live more than you want to see amazing things happen.</font><br />
[Sat Apr 24 00:26:57 2010] : <b>(6844) Alan</b>: <font color='#00008c'>You run for the fucking hills, right?</font><br />
[Sat Apr 24 00:27:20 2010] : <b>(6844) Alan</b>: <font color='#00008c'>Unless hell already broke loose, in which case the safest place you can be is right next to him, of course... though even then, you're a redshirt.</font><br />
[Sat Apr 24 00:27:56 2010] : <b>(6842) Renate</b>: <font color='#000080'>(Calacanis is an ASSHOLE. And part of the reason Renate treated Wilmington with kid gloves was that he wasn't wrong.)</font><br />
[Sat Apr 24 00:28:16 2010] : <b>(6844) Alan</b>: <font color='#00008c'>And yeah, RTD is horrible, but horrible in this way where I can see why he kept his job.</font><br />
[Sat Apr 24 00:28:26 2010] : <b>(6844) Alan</b>: <font color='#00008c'>He has all these really excellent relatively well written setups...</font><br />
[Sat Apr 24 00:28:32 2010] : <b>(6844) Alan</b>: <font color='#00008c'>it's just that he has NO IDEA how to end anything.</font><br />

[Sat Apr 24 00:29:35 2010] : <b>(6844) Alan</b>: <font color='#00008c'>Also, I kind of think the writing team in general lacked balls. I was impressed that they even allowed "holy shit aliens are real" to enter the public awareness, of course.</font><br />
[Sat Apr 24 00:29:51 2010] : <b>(6844) Alan</b>: <font color='#00008c'>After 40 years of UNIT I don't know how it could have been kept secret.</font><br />

[Sat Apr 24 00:31:43 2010] : <b>(6844) Alan</b>: <font color='#00008c'>But he'd already been a villain.</font><br />
[Sat Apr 24 00:31:57 2010] : <b>(6842) Renate</b>: <font color='#000080'>The Master is not a buffoon or a jokester. He was always the Doctor's elegant reflection.</font><br />
[Sat Apr 24 00:32:26 2010] : <b>(6844) Alan</b>: <font color='#00008c'>Yeah. The more ridiculous the Doctor gets (and the Fourth was more ridiculous even than Tennant), the more Mandarin the Master should be.</font><br />

[Sat Apr 24 00:40:12 2010] : <b>(6843) Rien</b>: <font color='#263607'>"Yes... my friend, I have been granted a Barony in what was formerly a Patchwork kingdom.  I have come to learn that the place is under the protection of a group of Druids, and I thought that it would be best if I could find out who they're Devoted to, and how I may contact them so I can formally ask permission to enter the forest."</font><br />
[Sat Apr 24 00:43:55 2010] : <b>(6844) Alan</b>: <font color='#00008c'>"Many groves in the Patchwork Kingdoms have come under the protection of druids... with ten thousand wars come ten thousand fires, and in some places, only the forestal wardens have power and authority to preserve them."</font><br />
[Sat Apr 24 00:44:27 2010] : <b>(6844) Alan</b>: <font color='#00008c'>Kander's speech is carried on the breeze through leaves, the chuckling of the not-too-distant brook.</font><br />

[Sat Apr 24 00:48:18 2010] : <b>(6843) Rien</b>: <font color='#263607'>"These particular druids are inhabiting and protecting Herrendon Woods and the Herrendon Deeps."</font><br />

[Sat Apr 24 02:23:28 2010] : <b>(6844) Alan</b>: <font color='#00008c'>After the exchange included in the preview email... Rien crosses the creek and enters Herrendon Deep.</font><br />

What looks like an irregular carpet of undergrowth ranging from fifty cm to one meter high turns out to be a major hindrance -- thorns, tough branches, and interlocking vines abound.</font><br />
[Sat Apr 24 02:28:46 2010] : <b>(6844) Alan</b>: <font color='#00008c'>No wonder explorers make heavy use of machetes as they carve a path through the jungles; Rien suspects that if he followed suit, a week later his passage would be undetectable.</font><br />
[Sat Apr 24 02:29:22 2010] : <b>(6843) Rien</b>: <font color='#263607'>But he wouldn't even consider it.  He'll just accept it and move slowly.</font><br />

[Sat Apr 24 02:32:22 2010] : <b>(6844) Alan</b>: <font color='#00008c'>Rien detects a dryad tree, off to his left; and it seems to detect him at the same time, because its bark bubbles outward and immediately resolves into the shape of a young humanoid girl, with an apparent age of no more than ten.</font><br />
[Sat Apr 24 02:33:37 2010] : <b>(6844) Alan</b>: <font color='#00008c'>Instead of human skin, she has polished white wood; instead of hair, she has fine strips of bark. In a concession to human modesty, she wears a short dress that seems to be made from a single huge leaf.</font><br />
[Sat Apr 24 02:33:59 2010] : <b>(6844) Alan</b>: <font color='#00008c'>She detaches from the tree and falls lightly to the ground, but Rien can sense the line of energy which connects her to it.</font><br />
[Sat Apr 24 02:34:13 2010] : <b>(6843) Rien</b>: <font color='#263607'>Rien stops and bows to her.  "Good morning.

[Sat Apr 24 02:35:00 2010] : <b>(6843) Rien</b>: <font color='#263607'>(I forgot to check... honeysuckle is a common variety of flower over here, and I believe it's an Australian native.

[Sat Apr 24 02:36:47 2010] : <b>(6844) Alan</b>: <font color='#00008c'>She hops back into the tree, melting into the bark without leaving a trace; and a second later she comes back out again.</font><br />

[Sat Apr 24 02:38:00 2010] : <b>(6844) Alan</b>: <font color='#00008c'>Rien notices several other flowers near the base of the tree -- each one exists in its own little patch of grass and smaller ferns, in what appears to be a decorative arrangement, even though this is not a normal habitat for grass.</font><br />
[Sat Apr 24 02:38:13 2010] : <b>(6843) Rien</b>: <font color='#263607'>"I have much more than I have brought with me.  I can share it out amongst... well, a lot of you.  I won't say all, since I have no idea how many of you there are."</font><br />
[Sat Apr 24 02:38:38 2010] : <b>(6844) Alan</b>: <font color='#00008c'>Some of the undergrowth near Rien flows away as the earth reshapes itself, leaving a perfect circle of bare earth.</font><br />
[Sat Apr 24 02:38:48 2010] : <b>(6844) Alan</b>: <font color='#00008c'>Then a dimple appears in the earth and deepens into a hole.</font><br />

[Sat Apr 24 02:39:49 2010] : <b>(6844) Alan</b>: <font color='#00008c'>She seems to mean this as a joke, but it's hard to tell; her natural expression is coy amusement.</font><br />
[Sat Apr 24 02:41:11 2010] : <b>(6843) Rien</b>: <font color='#263607'>"I do not mind getting my hands dirty in a good cause."  He kneels by the hole and places the seedling pot into the hole.

[Sat Apr 24 02:42:54 2010] : <b>(6844) Alan</b>: <font color='#00008c'>She has a knowing look, and a natural poise, that is at odds with the apparent age of her form; but she claps with excitement as the hole closes around the pot, and then the pot itself reshapes into a little tesselated ring around the flower.</font><br />
[Sat Apr 24 02:43:08 2010] : <b>(6844) Alan</b>: <font color='#00008c'>"Since the pot's clay, I can make it part of the earth. Handy, right?"</font><br />

[Sat Apr 24 03:15:24 2010] : <b>(6844) Alan</b>: <font color='#00008c'>Rien's planar senses give him a contradictory answer: the portal has signs of leading to the Chaos Plane, <i>and</i> signs of leading to another location in the human world... but that other location is impossibly close.</font><br />
[Sat Apr 24 03:15:55 2010] : <b>(6844) Alan</b>: <font color='#00008c'>Rien's best guess would be that it leads to a pocket dimension of the Chaos Plane which is superimposed on this part of the human world, as a sort of chaos Mirror realm.</font><br />
[Sat Apr 24 03:16:01 2010] : <b>(6844) Alan</b>: <font color='#00008c'>And Rien's best guess is usually pretty good.</font><br />
