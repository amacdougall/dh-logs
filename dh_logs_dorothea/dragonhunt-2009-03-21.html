[Sat Mar 21 00:01:17 2009] : <b>(23940) Renate</b>: <font color='#000080'>"I shouldn't go that far. Given the right situation, anything can be made useful. Even a blind girl."</font><br />
[Sat Mar 21 00:02:41 2009] : <b>(23939) Alan</b>: <font color='#000080'>This is the first Renate has got the best of him all day. Once he finished absorbing her lessons and began teaching her his, the balance tilted precipitously. Attempting to project inner power, rather than settle it, has thrown her largely off balance... like swinging a sledgehammer after a decade of swinging a mallet.</font><br />
[Sat Mar 21 00:03:30 2009] : <b>(23940) Renate</b>: <font color='#000080'>"Right. Let me try that move again, please." Whatever her frustration, she is unfailingly courteous to Daniel.</font><br />
[Sat Mar 21 00:04:25 2009] : <b>(23939) Alan</b>: <font color='#000080'>Consciously or not, Aaron designed Wrenfall to accomodate the expression of inner power, while teaching Renate and Emil only its more refined, kata-like aspects. Daniel used it recklessly, lacking the finer fundamentals of swordsmanship, but his raw talent and rough-hewn self-discipline saved him this far.</font><br />
[Sat Mar 21 00:06:36 2009] : <b>(23939) Alan</b>: <font color='#000080'>Under Renate's training, he has managed to slowly restrain and retrain himself; and has come to realize exactly how close to death he had been coming. As now: he and Renate come together, wood clacking against wood.</font><br />
[Sat Mar 21 00:07:18 2009] : <b>(23939) Alan</b>: <font color='#000080'>Renate's goal is to slip away from his line of sight, while his is to keep her locked in place; and attacks which earned him a slap from her sword weeks ago are nearly flawless now.</font><br />
[Sat Mar 21 00:07:50 2009] : <b>(23939) Alan</b>: <font color='#000080'>Or at least -- Renate is fully aware -- sufficient to deny <i>her</i> a safe opening.</font><br />
[Sat Mar 21 00:08:27 2009] : <b>(23940) Renate</b>: <font color='#000080'>He has learned not to watch her eyes; she uses them to deceive, since she knows most combatants are trained to watch them.</font><br />
[Sat Mar 21 00:08:55 2009] : <b>(23939) Alan</b>: <font color='#000080'>There are false openings, of course: she has picked up any number of dirty tricks from his years as a mercenary, stunts easily as carelessly pragmatic as Aaron's original Dust Attack, Sunday Punch, and Jet Counter.</font><br />
[Sat Mar 21 00:09:43 2009] : <b>(23939) Alan</b>: <font color='#000080'>Aaron's book must have included some of the same advice he always gave her: against a weak opponent, watch the eyes, but against a good one, watch the chest. When that moves, the body must move.</font><br />
[Sat Mar 21 00:10:36 2009] : <b>(23940) Renate</b>: <font color='#000080'>Daniel has both books now, as they are no use to Renate.</font><br />
[Sat Mar 21 00:11:22 2009] : <b>(23939) Alan</b>: <font color='#000080'>The difference, in this past week of training, is that Daniel is not using pure swordsmanship anymore; he is using his own versions of Aaron's moves, ones Renate has learned to expect, but not entirely how to deal with.</font><br />
[Sat Mar 21 00:12:53 2009] : <b>(23939) Alan</b>: <font color='#000080'>And Daniel has adapted to her feints as must as she has adapted to his -- last time, her crossover step got her out of his line of sight. This time, he is two steps ahead of her: he assumes she will feint the crossover step and go the other way instead, so the moment he sees it, he "falls for" it by throwing a Doomsday Punch in the other direction.</font><br />
[Sat Mar 21 00:13:25 2009] : <b>(23939) Alan</b>: <font color='#000080'>It's too many levels of logic for Renate to pick up on in the heat of the moment; she's sent rolling.</font><br />
[Sat Mar 21 00:14:03 2009] : <b>(23940) Renate</b>: <font color='#000080'>She allows herself one heartfelt "Damn!" and then climbs back to her feet. "One more time, please."</font><br />
[Sat Mar 21 00:14:17 2009] : <b>(23939) Alan</b>: <font color='#000080'>Daniel's been improving the move: before, it was a deafening explosion of force which hurt him as well as the opponent, and left him staggering forward with the power of the swing.</font><br />
[Sat Mar 21 00:14:34 2009] : <b>(23939) Alan</b>: <font color='#000080'>Now it is weaker, but much more controlled; he helps her up with the same hand.</font><br />
[Sat Mar 21 00:16:41 2009] : <b>(23940) Renate</b>: <font color='#000080'>"Thank you, Daniel."</font><br />
[Sat Mar 21 00:17:08 2009] : <b>(23939) Alan</b>: <font color='#000080'>Renate has not tried to create a fully ki-based variant of any of her moves yet; it is a commitment, and she is probably not sure that's even her style.</font><br />
[Sat Mar 21 00:18:50 2009] : <b>(23940) Renate</b>: <font color='#000080'>These sessions are only secondarily about her, as she has not the threat of death hanging over her that Daniel does, and in any case he can use Aaron's books and she can't. Of course she gladly learns what she can, but her goal is to see him safe.</font><br />
[Sat Mar 21 00:18:52 2009] : <b>(23939) Alan</b>: <font color='#000080'>But in order to counter the force of Daniel's blows, she has learned to channel her ki into her sword, greatly increasing the power of her Fortress Defense, Quicksand, and Guard Crush moves.</font><br />
[Sat Mar 21 00:19:35 2009] : <b>(23939) Alan</b>: <font color='#000080'>Attacks which would have beat through her guard, or tossed her around like a doll, now deflect with a shower of sparks (on metal) or a hiss of white smoke (on wood).</font><br />
[Sat Mar 21 00:20:05 2009] : <b>(23939) Alan</b>: <font color='#000080'>Attacks which would have knocked her down now just make her slide back a few dozen centimeters... if she can get her sword in the way of them.</font><br />
[Sat Mar 21 00:21:02 2009] : <b>(23939) Alan</b>: <font color='#000080'>"Again?"</font><br />
[Sat Mar 21 00:21:25 2009] : <b>(23940) Renate</b>: <font color='#000080'>"Yes."</font><br />
[Sat Mar 21 00:22:26 2009] : <b>(23939) Alan</b>: <font color='#000080'>"You've escaped me about a quarter of the time so far. After getting behind me, I can only flush you out with an area attack, such as Tarpit."</font><br />
[Sat Mar 21 00:22:47 2009] : <b>(23940) Renate</b>: <font color='#000080'>She is as diligent a student as she is patient a teacher. "Do you think I can do better?"</font><br />
[Sat Mar 21 00:22:49 2009] : <b>(23939) Alan</b>: <font color='#000080'>(That's his version of Quicksand: it literally liquefies an inch of the ground around him, putting opponents on unsteady footing.)</font><br />

[Sat Mar 21 00:23:39 2009] : <b>(23939) Alan</b>: <font color='#000080'>"As for the one-quarter statistic... I'm expecting it. Against unwary opponents, I think you could get behind them much more easily."</font><br />

[Sat Mar 21 00:24:05 2009] : <b>(23940) Renate</b>: <font color='#000080'>"Hm. We'll see. I fight dragons. They expect everything."</font><br />
[Sat Mar 21 00:24:54 2009] : <b>(23939) Alan</b>: <font color='#000080'>"This might not work on dragons... many of them have nearly full fields of vision, like a horse. I am fairly sure their vibration sense is very directional, though."</font><br />

[Sat Mar 21 00:26:35 2009] : <b>(23939) Alan</b>: <font color='#000080'>"Very good aim, in this case. It was Old Wolf at the battle of Kriegersfeld. My first real battle."</font><br />
[Sat Mar 21 00:26:51 2009] : <b>(23939) Alan</b>: <font color='#000080'>"The dragon was my supposed employer. The contract didn't pan out.</font><br />
[Sat Mar 21 00:27:25 2009] : <b>(23939) Alan</b>: <font color='#000080'>"That is when I developed my first rule as a mercenary: find out if your employer is evil."</font><br />

[Sat Mar 21 00:27:30 2009] : <b>(23940) Renate</b>: <font color='#000080'>"You know Old Wolf? He is a friend."</font><br />
[Sat Mar 21 00:28:25 2009] : <b>(23939) Alan</b>: <font color='#000080'>"I met him briefly, later, but I did not have time to do any more than express my admiration. Which he accepted gracefully, through long practice."</font><br />
[Sat Mar 21 00:29:15 2009] : <b>(23940) Renate</b>: <font color='#000080'>She smiles. "He is gracious, for a man who has lived an uncommonly rough life."</font><br />

[Sat Mar 21 00:32:55 2009] : <b>(23939) Alan</b>: <font color='#000080'>"I have an idea..."</font><br />
[Sat Mar 21 00:33:46 2009] : <b>(23939) Alan</b>: <font color='#000080'>"You used a technique, just a few times, earlier, where you would barrel into me, throw a kick, then use the kick to boost off me in another direction. I caught on to it, and you stopped using it."</font><br />
[Sat Mar 21 00:34:33 2009] : <b>(23939) Alan</b>: <font color='#000080'>"But what if you did a combination attack from behind me? You could throw a slash, intending that it will <i>not</i> be blocked, and aim to kick off the opponent and land behind him."</font><br />
[Sat Mar 21 00:35:07 2009] : <b>(23939) Alan</b>: <font color='#000080'>"You would have to know that he will not block, AND know that he will try to turn when you hit him. But if it works, you would immediately go back to hiding."</font><br />

[Sat Mar 21 00:36:34 2009] : <b>(23940) Renate</b>: <font color='#000080'>"Hm." She rehearses that in her head, silently. "Worth a try. I'll try not to let you see it coming." She raises her wooden sword, and they are off again.</font><br />
[Sat Mar 21 00:37:44 2009] : <b>(23939) Alan</b>: <font color='#000080'>(Okay, he left. I took the moment to change the soaking water on these habichuelas.)</font><br />
[Sat Mar 21 00:38:46 2009] : <b>(23939) Alan</b>: <font color='#000080'>This time, Daniel allows her to slip past him; he casts about, forcing her to keep moving.</font><br />
[Sat Mar 21 00:39:27 2009] : <b>(23939) Alan</b>: <font color='#000080'>If he runs forward, she has to run with him; otherwise, when he turns, she won't be able to stay behind him.</font><br />
[Sat Mar 21 00:40:30 2009] : <b>(23939) Alan</b>: <font color='#000080'>He makes her work for the attack; twice she starts, then checks her blow when she senses him invoking the Faultless Defense, his samurai-like state of alertness that lets him instantly strike aside any attack.</font><br />
[Sat Mar 21 00:40:51 2009] : <b>(23939) Alan</b>: <font color='#000080'>Unlike deLeon, however, Daniel's Faultless Defense stays up only a second at a time.</font><br />
[Sat Mar 21 00:41:58 2009] : <b>(23939) Alan</b>: <font color='#000080'>(The term "Fortress Defense" comes from Guilty Gear, where it has also been transliterated as "Faultless Defense" -- the original was katakana for "fouturesu defensu", so it could go either way.)</font><br />
[Sat Mar 21 00:42:15 2009] : <b>(23940) Renate</b>: <font color='#000080'>(nice!)</font><br />

[Sat Mar 21 00:43:56 2009] : <b>(23939) Alan</b>: <font color='#000080'>When Renate finds her opening, Daniel's proposal turns out to be insightful: even though he is expecting something, he isn't ready for her wrestling-range onslaught.</font><br />
[Sat Mar 21 00:45:17 2009] : <b>(23939) Alan</b>: <font color='#000080'>A curved sword is better in close quarters; she's able to do what would be a deep slash (the wood just slides against his leather hauberk) and immediately scramble over and around his shoulders to land on the other side.</font><br />
[Sat Mar 21 00:46:03 2009] : <b>(23939) Alan</b>: <font color='#000080'>The move is half freebrawling showmanship, half makeshift expedience.</font><br />
[Sat Mar 21 00:47:03 2009] : <b>(23939) Alan</b>: <font color='#000080'>"That is a <i>fine</i> move," Daniel says, whipping his head around only to see that she's blindsided him again.</font><br />
[Sat Mar 21 00:47:35 2009] : <b>(23939) Alan</b>: <font color='#000080'>"There's no time to do a killing blow and still get back into hiding, but you'll wear anyone down in a hurry."</font><br />
[Sat Mar 21 00:47:45 2009] : <b>(23940) Renate</b>: <font color='#000080'>"Hmph," she says. "Disgracefully sloppy. Let me try it again. Your father would have boxed my ears."</font><br />
[Sat Mar 21 00:49:25 2009] : <b>(23939) Alan</b>: <font color='#000080'>"All right. This time I'll pressure you."</font><br />
[Sat Mar 21 00:50:56 2009] : <b>(23940) Renate</b>: <font color='#000080'>"This time," she returns, "I might know what I'm doing."</font><br />
[Sat Mar 21 00:52:00 2009] : <b>(23939) Alan</b>: <font color='#000080'>This time, after Renate disappears out of his peripheral vision, Daniel does something new: he immediately does a backward moonsault, using his inner power to blast off from the ground.</font><br />
[Sat Mar 21 00:52:33 2009] : <b>(23939) Alan</b>: <font color='#000080'>He usually avoids these acrobatics, as they're an inefficient use of his ki and he has poor control of them, but Renate has a hard time telling which way to move.</font><br />
[Sat Mar 21 00:52:53 2009] : <b>(23939) Alan</b>: <font color='#000080'>In the end, she is able to slip behind him again as he lands, but dodges his wooden sword by a hair.</font><br />
[Sat Mar 21 00:53:25 2009] : <b>(23939) Alan</b>: <font color='#000080'>That would appear to be her opening; does she take it?</font><br />
[Sat Mar 21 00:54:11 2009] : <b>(23940) Renate</b>: <font color='#000080'>Sure.</font><br />
[Sat Mar 21 00:54:17 2009] : <b>(23940) Renate</b>: <font color='#000080'>Nothing ventured, nothing learned.</font><br />
[Sat Mar 21 00:54:45 2009] : <b>(23940) Renate</b>: <font color='#000080'>If she fails, she will learn from that.</font><br />
[Sat Mar 21 00:55:37 2009] : <b>(23939) Alan</b>: <font color='#000080'>Daniel knew that was the opening as well; her sword is smacked away by his Faultless Defense as he spins fast as the force of instinct.</font><br />
[Sat Mar 21 00:56:12 2009] : <b>(23939) Alan</b>: <font color='#000080'>This is how it has been over this whole span of weeks: the physical arts are never as crucial as the mental battle.</font><br />

[Sat Mar 21 00:58:30 2009] : <b>(23940) Renate</b>: <font color='#000080'>"Avoid it," she says economically, setting up for another try.</font><br />
[Sat Mar 21 00:58:57 2009] : <b>(23939) Alan</b>: <font color='#000080'>"Sensible. But there is something I learned that might help you when avoidance is not possible."</font><br />
[Sat Mar 21 00:59:37 2009] : <b>(23939) Alan</b>: <font color='#000080'>"Here, let me demonstrate." He goes over to the edge of the training field, where a bucket of stll-cool well water sits with a steel ladle.</font><br />

[Sat Mar 21 01:01:54 2009] : <b>(23939) Alan</b>: <font color='#000080'>He sheathes his sword, and drops into a deep horse stance, pushing out with his palms against an invisible wall while breathing out. A rough ki-building measure compared to the meditations Aaron taught.</font><br />
