[Fri Apr 21 19:19:55 2006] : <B>(4) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>(My "amnesia camouflage" totally worked.)</font><br>
[Fri Apr 21 19:20:11 2006] : <B>(1) Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>Well, give 'em a chance to hole up, wash, eat, sleep, sew their clothes into something vaguely resembling respectability (particularly important for Renate), exult (Aryk)...</font><br>
[Fri Apr 21 19:20:31 2006] : <B>(4) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>So you're out in the middle of some jungle, the bandits have returned cautiously to pick up their loot, Marcus's lackeys have helped him away.</font><br>
[Fri Apr 21 19:20:55 2006] : <B>(1) Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>And they've had an argument about who's leading. :)</font><br>
[Fri Apr 21 19:20:57 2006] : <B>(4) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>That tea shop would be a suitable waypoint, it does have a small hostel, now that you've gained the wary respect of the bandits.</font><br>
[Fri Apr 21 19:21:02 2006] : <B>(1) Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>Fair enough.</font><br>
[Fri Apr 21 19:21:09 2006] : <B>(4) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>Or you could head back to Skyseek town.</font><br>
[Fri Apr 21 19:21:25 2006] : <B>(4) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>It's getting dark by now, anyway, since you left at 6pm, right?</font><br>
[Fri Apr 21 19:21:39 2006] : <B>(1) Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>Something like that.</font><br>
[Fri Apr 21 19:21:52 2006] : <B>(1) Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>Skyseek is likely to be infested with LoCaines, however.</font><br>
[Fri Apr 21 19:21:56 2006] : <B>(4) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>Near the equator, seasons don't affect the length of the day as much, so the sun has probably already set, actually.</font><br>
[Fri Apr 21 19:22:31 2006] : <B>(4) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>You know what Aryk needs to do -- he needs to start practicing with that sword.</font><br>
[Fri Apr 21 19:22:38 2006] : <B>(1) Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>Yep. Renate'll spar with him.</font><br>
[Fri Apr 21 19:22:49 2006] : <B>(4) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>In fact, we can go from there. The item in itself is plenty of conversation-starter.</font><br>
[Fri Apr 21 19:22:52 2006] : <B>(4) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'><hr /></font><br>
[Fri Apr 21 19:23:26 2006] : <B>(4) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>The einh&auml;nder is completely different from its two-handed brother; only their basic shapes are similar.</font><br>
[Fri Apr 21 19:23:33 2006] : <B>(1) Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>"Well, young paladin, let's see the steel."</font><br>
[Fri Apr 21 19:24:01 2006] : <B>(4) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>And since Aryk never used a traditional zweihander at all, the transition from "very very long-bladed axe" to "duelist's saber" is quite an abrup one.</font><br>
[Fri Apr 21 19:24:02 2006] : <font color='#008000'>** (2) Aryk swings it in figure-eights experimentally, shrugs, then hands it over. **</font><br>
[Fri Apr 21 19:24:16 2006] : <B>(4) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>It almost feels like fighting with nothing at all, to Aryk's conditioned muscles.</font><br>
[Fri Apr 21 19:24:26 2006] : <B>(4) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>Renate, of course, would find it only slightly lighter than Crescent Light.</font><br>
[Fri Apr 21 19:24:34 2006] : <B>(2) Aryk</B>: <font color='#000080'>"It's so light... it's goign to be hard to get used to.  But... I'm looking forward to the challenge."</font><br>
[Fri Apr 21 19:24:55 2006] : <B>(1) Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>"Finesse can be learnt. Come outside and try. You can't beat me up any worse than those heresimachs did."</font><br>
[Fri Apr 21 19:24:58 2006] : <B>(4) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>(Aryk may have to relearn how to slice; the giant two-hander allowed more of a chopping motion.)</font><br>
[Fri Apr 21 19:25:18 2006] : <B>(4) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>(But a smaller sword absolutely requires pull-through; another thing Renate is well accustomed to from Crescent Light.)</font><br>
[Fri Apr 21 19:25:33 2006] : <B>(4) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>(Aryk's old zweihander did as much by breaking bones as by cutting flesh.)</font><br>
[Fri Apr 21 19:25:58 2006] : <B>(1) Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>She isn't limping as she goes out to the yard. Not <em>exactly</em> limping.</font><br>
[Fri Apr 21 19:26:40 2006] : <B>(1) Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>She turns back. "Well? Are you coming, or do I have to ask Rien to open you a portal?"</font><br>
[Fri Apr 21 19:26:53 2006] : <B>(4) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>Sylvie's sword is heavily customized, too, to suit her fighting style and her personality; in addition to the three dangling charms (a skull, a bell, and a teddy bear), it has serrated notches along one edge of the blade, near the hilt; they look like the sawteeth on a multipurpose wilderness knife.</font><br>
[Fri Apr 21 19:27:35 2006] : <B>(4) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>It's flexible, too; an overenthusiastic swing makes the blade quiver.</font><br>
[Fri Apr 21 19:28:10 2006] : <B>(4) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>It's obvious now why Black Inferno de-emphasizes weapon-on-weapon defenses; the sword isn't suited to it.</font><br>
[Fri Apr 21 19:28:17 2006] : <B>(2) Aryk</B>: <font color='#000080'>Aryk follows.  "Yeah, yeah.  You're going to school me, though.  It's going to take me a bit before I can even get the basics down."  Aryk mindlessly flails the sword as he walks, trying to get a feel for it, a bit agitated.  The blade, in Aryk's hands, practically vibrates while being swung.</font><br>
[Fri Apr 21 19:29:01 2006] : <B>(1) Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>"I said finesse, Aryk," Renate warns, watching him. "You can't whip it around like an axe; it's a slicing weapon."</font><br>
[Fri Apr 21 19:29:06 2006] : <B>(4) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>Aryk remembers the basic stances and swings of the style; though he remembers them in terms of its related Sacred Flame style, he could probably mimic them, even if he doesn't know the theory.</font><br>
[Fri Apr 21 19:29:23 2006] : <B>(4) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>A lot of the footwork is identical.</font><br>
[Fri Apr 21 19:29:40 2006] : <B>(1) Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>"Here, toss me your arm-guards, please."</font><br>
[Fri Apr 21 19:29:58 2006] : <B>(1) Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>On her, they make a fair shield.</font><br>
[Fri Apr 21 19:30:40 2006] : <B>(4) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>The tea-house has become a nightspot, as field-workers drink square wooden cups of rice wine and local beer. Several of them watch idly (assuming you're anywhere within sight of the building).</font><br>
[Fri Apr 21 19:30:47 2006] : <B>(1) Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>"Now, you won't want to smash down with that. Save your strength for the carry-through."</font><br>
[Fri Apr 21 19:30:55 2006] : <B>(1) Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>"Go ahead; I'm ready now."</font><br>
[Fri Apr 21 19:31:44 2006] : <B>(4) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>(AFK to massacre garlic. Back in 5.)</font><br>
[Fri Apr 21 19:33:17 2006] : <B>(2) Aryk</B>: <font color='#000080'>Aryk takes up a stance.  Peculiarly enough, the sword finds itself comfortable in his hands ina reverse-grip; Aryk holds the blade by the handle, but upside-down.  "Okay... er... here goes nothin'."  Aryk steps in to attack.  The blade whirls unpredictably from behind him into a deadly and wild swing.... that is, it would be, if there were any skill to the attack.  Instead, the attack would miss on it's own, defended or not.</font><br>
[Fri Apr 21 19:33:54 2006] : <B>(1) Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>"Slower," Renate says calmly, not having moved. "Ilium wasn't built in a day. Get the basic swing right, then we'll move on."</font><br>
[Fri Apr 21 19:34:08 2006] : <B>(1) Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>Crescent Light rests in its scabbard on her back.</font><br>
[Fri Apr 21 19:35:43 2006] : <font color='#008000'>** (2) Aryk nods.  His stance widens, and his center lowers closer to the ground.  Aryk attacks again, this time with more ease, but yet the attack still unleashes with unpredicable ferocity, which causes the blade to wobble in the air. **</font><br>
[Fri Apr 21 19:36:25 2006] : <B>(1) Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>"Better, but you're putting too much english on the start of the stroke. Even it out, and carry through. You can do this." She is patience personified. He has chosen the hard path; her job is to boost him up it.</font><br>
[Fri Apr 21 19:36:50 2006] : <B>(1) Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>She dodges a better-aimed slash. "Had you thought about what you'll tell Old Wolf about that blade?"</font><br>
[Fri Apr 21 19:37:57 2006] : <B>(2) Aryk</B>: <font color='#000080'>Aryk spins the sword back behind him, and eases up slightly.  "I've been thinking a lot about what I'll tell my friends.  Zan.  Old Wolf... them especially.  It's not going to be easy.  But... I'm going to tell them the truth."</font><br>
[Fri Apr 21 19:38:19 2006] : <B>(1) Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>"Well, of course. But to what end?"</font><br>
[Fri Apr 21 19:39:10 2006] : <B>(4) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>(Note that fighting with the sword in the ninja grip will be harder to get the hang of; but would have the benefit of being unlike Sacred Flame or Black Inferno as taught.)</font><br>
[Fri Apr 21 19:39:34 2006] : <B>(1) Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>(Aryk's da man here.)</font><br>
[Fri Apr 21 19:40:10 2006] : <B>(4) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>(Oh, it's perfectly cool, it'll just take more practice, and for a while Aryk won't be as good a fighter as he was before.)</font><br>
[Fri Apr 21 19:40:10 2006] : <B>(2) Aryk</B>: <font color='#000080'>"To what end?  Rennie... what I want to achieve... it goes beyond alliances... beyond friendships.  Beyond mortal ties.  I love and cherish my friends... but... I give myself wholly to my faith."</font><br>
[Fri Apr 21 19:40:24 2006] : <B>(2) Aryk</B>: <font color='#000080'>(Totally expect that.)</font><br>
[Fri Apr 21 19:40:46 2006] : <B>(1) Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>"I understand that. But talking to Old Wolf is an opportunity for you. I want to hear what you plan to make of it."</font><br>

[Fri Apr 21 19:42:13 2006] : <B>(2) Aryk</B>: <font color='#000080'>"Well... idealistically, I'd like to have him on my side.  Old Wolf is devoted to the only ways... but he's a free-thinker.  All of the Cloudgatherers are."  Aryk adjusts his grip. "Yeah, you're right... that's better.  Aryk slides back into his low-stance, his free hand floating before him.</font><br>
[Fri Apr 21 19:42:38 2006] : <B>(1) Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>"Nice. Try again. So what can you say to Old Wolf that will convince him?"</font><br>
[Fri Apr 21 19:43:58 2006] : <B>(2) Aryk</B>: <font color='#000080'>"Okay..." Aryk slides his front foot forward, then spins into an attack.  The movement is easy to predict, but again, the slash itself seems to come from out of the blue... it's pretty likely even Aryk doesn't know where the blade will end up.  </font><br>
[Fri Apr 21 19:44:38 2006] : <B>(1) Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>"Ow! Good job." Renate claps her hand over a slashed bicep. "Keep talking."</font><br>

[Fri Apr 21 19:46:31 2006] : <B>(1) Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>She ducks, jumps, twists to avoid his blows, a tricksy little pixie in the gloom barely relieved by lights from within the hostel. "You do realize that you will be accounted a heretic at some point."</font><br>

[Fri Apr 21 19:50:14 2006] : <B>(1) Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>"If you can tell me."</font><br>
[Fri Apr 21 19:52:16 2006] : <B>(2) Aryk</B>: <font color='#000080'>Aryk pulls his stance inward, so the next strike may possible mimic that of a snake coiled, ready to explode into a strike.  But he hesitates.  "Remember when I pulled him off to the side at the train station?  We were cold lampin' on that pillar?  I told him... I mean to do big things, and I wanted to make sure he wouldn't end up becoming my enemy.  He promised me that no matter what,  he'd have my back.  So long as I didn't become a Kahanite... and well, I'm not, really, so it should all be gravy."</font><br>
[Fri Apr 21 19:52:57 2006] : <B>(1) Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>She fist-blocks his wrist, and they are abruptly in a corps-a-corps. "They will call you a Kahanite."</font><br>

[Fri Apr 21 19:54:55 2006] : <B>(2) Aryk</B>: <font color='#000080'>Aryk staggers back, but reclaims his stance.  He does not lash out.  "All they need to do is listen to me for five seconds, and they'll realize I am no Kahanite, nor will I ever will be."</font><br>
[Fri Apr 21 19:55:47 2006] : <B>(1) Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>"You are sure of that? I am not. There is an entire Church hierarchy devoted to ferreting out whatever it is convenient to call heresy. It has erred before. But it has weight. More weight than you have, my brother."</font><br>
[Fri Apr 21 19:56:46 2006] : <B>(1) Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>She studies his body. "Right, now try some upwards swings; it's more sparing than side-to-side, and faster, too."</font><br>

[Fri Apr 21 20:00:01 2006] : <B>(2) Aryk</B>: <font color='#000080'>"I may be called a heretic, but not a Kahanite.  Adam is called a heretic by a lot of people, now... but I know in my heart he is not.  I can only hope there are many out there, like me, who desire for more understanding.  I want to make a difference, sis.  There's a big wave coming, and I want to ride it."  Aryk adjusts his stance to accomadate for vertical slashes as well, but feels uncomfortable.  He attacks with a wicked vertical slash from the ground up, but Renate can easily dodge it, and it leaves him completely vulnerable.</font><br>
