[Fri Dec 30 19:20:29 2005] : <B>(5) Aryk</B>: <font color='#000080'>Yeah, thankfully, I did.  And my cat better let me sleep in.</font><br>
[Fri Dec 30 19:20:39 2005] : <B>(1) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>I'm thinking if Rien and Aryk tag along to Karlbotel, then Renate and Aryk tag along to Gereval, something interesting would happen to Aryk along the line.</font><br>

[Fri Dec 30 19:22:28 2005] : <B>(5) Aryk</B>: <font color='#000080'>I'd go with less discriminating.  I actually remember being young and enjoying a McDonald's burger.</font><br>
[Fri Dec 30 19:22:50 2005] : <B>(1) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>Hell, I remember being 20 and enjoying at least the "spicy" chicken sandwich.</font><br>
[Fri Dec 30 19:23:14 2005] : <B>(5) Aryk</B>: <font color='#000080'>Me too.  Sad.</font><br>
[Fri Dec 30 19:23:36 2005] : <B>(3) Rien</B>: <font color='#004040'>I remember when they tried to call them sandwiches here, and Australians wouldn't take to it.  There was many a cry of "it's a flamin' hamburger mate.  Don't try to push that crap on us."</font><br>
[Fri Dec 30 19:23:53 2005] : <B>(1) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>(Well, it's not a hamburger if it doesn't have hamburger in it.)</font><br>
[Fri Dec 30 19:24:07 2005] : <B>(1) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>(I mean, what do you call it? A chicken hamburger?)</font><br>
[Fri Dec 30 19:24:30 2005] : <B>(1) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>Anyway, let's get cracking. If you're curious, the short version of Garland's pig roast is that, among some controversy, Stepside and Monta&ntilde;a convince him of a particularly inventive little plot:</font><br>
[Fri Dec 30 19:26:16 2005] : <B>(1) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>Establish "gangs," open to all ages, along the edges of the Clover District. Use some of the money to buy the gangs protection as "nations" under Clover District tradition. Lawbringer support, the whole deal.</font><br>
[Fri Dec 30 19:26:54 2005] : <B>(2) Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>Not too dissimilar to Renate's enclave idea.</font><br>
[Fri Dec 30 19:27:00 2005] : <B>(1) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>While still existing in the criminal system, these gangs would actually dip into the gray market at worst, doing their best to provide legitimate services.</font><br>
[Fri Dec 30 19:27:27 2005] : <B>(1) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>It's hard to be an honest businessman in a place where virtually everything is stolen, but they'd set up business practices to at least allow deniability.</font><br>
[Fri Dec 30 19:27:58 2005] : <B>(1) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>And the key point is that they'd support everyone present with a home-grown educational system.</font><br>
[Fri Dec 30 19:28:18 2005] : <B>(1) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>Hire a few professional tutors or teachers from outside the District; have them train local teachers; pass the craft on.</font><br>
[Fri Dec 30 19:28:32 2005] : <B>(2) Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>And, I hope, hire some of the smarty-pants out of the existing system. There are some damn, damn smart people in the Clover District.</font><br>
[Fri Dec 30 19:28:42 2005] : <B>(1) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>Teach tradeskills and general math, sciences, and liberal arts.</font><br>
[Fri Dec 30 19:29:27 2005] : <B>(1) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>Now, Stepside's risking his job with this idea, since he's basically proposing throwing government money into the creation of a new armed outlaw faction.</font><br>
[Fri Dec 30 19:29:42 2005] : <B>(1) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>Military self-sufficiency would be a goal of the enclaves as well, after all.</font><br>
[Fri Dec 30 19:29:57 2005] : <B>(2) Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>With Garland's money, how badly would Stepside need his job?</font><br>
[Fri Dec 30 19:30:12 2005] : <B>(2) Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>After all, Renate and Talos are moving into Xanadu/Ys, and they'll be a source of support also.</font><br>
[Fri Dec 30 19:30:46 2005] : <B>(2) Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>Not to mention that if Stepside starts seeing results, the powers that be will be clamoring to climb on his bandwagon.</font><br>
[Fri Dec 30 19:31:07 2005] : <B>(5) Aryk</B>: <font color='#000080'>I don't know if it's a good thing or not that Aryk wasn't there to witness this establishment, because there's a good chance he'd fight like hell to see to it that no one put any sort of organizational role in Garland's hands.</font><br>
[Fri Dec 30 19:31:40 2005] : <B>(2) Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>All in all, I think this is a hopeful development. It's certainly different. Renate will come out publicly in favor of Stepside's plan.</font><br>
[Fri Dec 30 19:31:44 2005] : <B>(3) Rien</B>: <font color='#004040'>Well, they're not</font><br>
[Fri Dec 30 19:31:50 2005] : <B>(1) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>Stepside plans to swing tax amnesty and tax exemption for people who go through a sort of naturalization process, too... that's a ways out.</font><br>
[Fri Dec 30 19:31:52 2005] : <B>(3) Rien</B>: <font color='#004040'>they're simply taking his money ot put it to the use they said</font><br>
[Fri Dec 30 19:31:55 2005] : <B>(1) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>That's the part that Garland particularly liked.</font><br>
[Fri Dec 30 19:31:59 2005] : <B>(2) Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>hell no... Renate is sleeping blissfully through the whole pig roast</font><br>
[Fri Dec 30 19:32:24 2005] : <B>(5) Aryk</B>: <font color='#000080'>I don't see Garland just handing over money without wanting in return some sort of leadership position over it.</font><br>
[Fri Dec 30 19:32:26 2005] : <B>(1) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>One of the main things preventing Clover District people from taking government services, or even just leaving, is that they've never paid taxes in their lives...</font><br>
[Fri Dec 30 19:32:34 2005] : <B>(2) Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>ah, clever indeed</font><br>
[Fri Dec 30 19:32:46 2005] : <B>(1) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>...and so the moment they tried to get, say, an ID card, they'd have to pay a gazillion silver in back taxes.</font><br>
[Fri Dec 30 19:32:59 2005] : <B>(2) Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>though a no-brainer, really; as it is, they're costing gummint funds</font><br>
[Fri Dec 30 19:33:08 2005] : <B>(2) Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>if you bring them back into the system, they'll start paying into it</font><br>
[Fri Dec 30 19:33:25 2005] : <B>(1) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>Right. The government has always been willing to make arrangements, but the debt never actually would go away.</font><br>
[Fri Dec 30 19:33:30 2005] : <B>(2) Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>(FORGIVE EMERGENT COUNTRIES' DEBT NOW, DAMMIT, for much the same reason)</font><br>
[Fri Dec 30 19:34:25 2005] : <B>(1) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>Well, if you're all-capsing things, GIVE EMERGENT COUNTRIES RULERS WHO AREN'T HILARIOUSLY CORRUPT is a better candidate.</font><br>

And aside from that, in her home province is <i>not</i> the place to do it.  If you truly feel you need to do this, there will be other opportunities.  But this is neither the time nor the place.  Renate needs her brother, now -- you, that is -- to be strong and stay by her side.  Not to go gallivanting off on a path of revenge because of someone else's mistakes."</font><br>

Unorthodox or no, he shall have some form of response presently.  Now leave."</font><br>

Then his construct had the sheer audacity to chide me about being polite to him.  <i>Him</i>.  The architect of... everything about me.  Everything that is strange and inhuman.  The man who used me as a pawn in a game of revenge, in something I had nothing to do with."</font><br>
[Fri Dec 30 22:56:36 2005] : <B>(2) Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>"Oh." Renate throws away the chaff, seizes on the kernel of wheat. "He wants to see you? Why?"</font><br>

[Fri Dec 30 22:59:15 2005] : <B>(2) Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>"Oh." Renate's face closes, opacifies. "Are you going to go?"</font><br>

[Fri Dec 30 23:03:20 2005] : <B>(3) Rien</B>: <font color='#004040'>"Shouldn't is easier.  I shouldn't because we don't know what else he's left in my head, what other irresistable control linkages I have hidden away in there.  We don't know how he did to me what he did, or even what it was he did in a lot of cases, so we won't know if he's doing it again.  He has a lot of experience in manipulating me and leading me aorund by the nose, such that I don't know I'm being lead.  All of these are why.  He may rip from my mind every shred of knowledge about you, about Aryk, about this place.  He may turn me, once more, into a mockery of the person I was."</font><br>

[Fri Dec 30 23:07:02 2005] : <B>(3) Rien</B>: <font color='#004040'>"Should, though, is a more tricky matter.  He's going to offer to tell me who I am, I can feel it.  Or what I am.  And I want to know that so much it burns inside me.  I've lived two long in the dark.  I want ot know me.  I'm also afraid ot know me, but that's a different matter.  It may also give us some insight into what he's planning, or where he's going.  Or what he originally intended with me in the first place.

[Fri Dec 30 23:08:38 2005] : <B>(2) Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>"To that I would add," Renate says, "that Gereval offers more matters to find out about, not even necessarily from Ankoku.
