It seems strange for a true 'wizard' to exist in one of the outer planes, but it is not outside the realm of possibility.

[Fri Dec  7 19:34:02 2007] : <b>(4963) Alan</b>: <font color='#000080'>The staircase gives out onto an ornate hallway; the rule here seems to be that as you get closer to the seat of power, you see fewer big-world objects coerced into Underside service, whereas in Crumb Alley it was the other way around.</font><br />
