[Fri Aug 14 23:41:23 2009] : <b>(2659) Aryk</b>: <font color='#710000'>Aryk sits up.  "Okay, I'm going to be brutally honest here."</font><br />
[Fri Aug 14 23:42:00 2009] : <b>(2660) Alan</b>: <font color='#000080'>"Are we ready for this?" Holmstock asks with possible sarcasm.</font><br />
[Fri Aug 14 23:42:02 2009] : <b>(2659) Aryk</b>: <font color='#710000'>"Rien, what are the chances there's a 'Dark Eternal's buddy' personality in there?" Aryk inquires, pointing at Rien's forehead.</font><br />
[Fri Aug 14 23:43:06 2009] : <b>(2658) Rien</b>: <font color='#400040'>Rien's eyes narrow slightly, "as much chance as there's a woman, three dwarves and a chicken.  Some chance, how much is impossible to say."</font><br />

[Fri Aug 14 23:44:37 2009] : <b>(2658) Rien</b>: <font color='#400040'>"And your point is...?"</font><br />
[Fri Aug 14 23:45:02 2009] : <b>(2660) Alan</b>: <font color='#000080'>"And he and Dark Eternal were in it up to their ears, is the point," Holmstock says impatiently.</font><br />
[Fri Aug 14 23:45:16 2009] : <b>(2659) Aryk</b>: <font color='#710000'>"Yeah."</font><br />
[Fri Aug 14 23:45:30 2009] : <b>(2658) Rien</b>: <font color='#400040'>"And was I in it up to my ears?  Me?  Rien Gerevannin?"</font><br />
[Fri Aug 14 23:46:18 2009] : <b>(2659) Aryk</b>: <font color='#710000'>"Rien, I trust you.  You know this.  But I wasn't always fond of Trancey.  Till we found out Trancey was you, and then... well anyways... St. Lucien probably didn't die.  It was too convenient."</font><br />

[Fri Aug 14 23:47:04 2009] : <b>(2660) Alan</b>: <font color='#000080'>Holmstock's form grows murkier, until he is just glowing eyes in a humanoid cloud of smoke. "I was in the Sacred World for most of this, but I get the impression you had to do a lot of work to win your own mind free and clear."</font><br />
[Fri Aug 14 23:47:12 2009] : <b>(2660) Alan</b>: <font color='#000080'>"I can sympathize with that. Tell me I can't."</font><br />
[Fri Aug 14 23:47:53 2009] : <b>(2660) Alan</b>: <font color='#000080'>"But if you let that blunt your logic, I'll be mighty disappointed."</font><br />

[Fri Aug 14 23:49:57 2009] : <b>(2661) Renate</b>: <font color='#000080'>"Well, goodness," Renate deadpans, "surely knowing about a sentimental weakness in a foe is no use at <em>all</em>."</font><br />
[Fri Aug 14 23:50:25 2009] : <b>(2660) Alan</b>: <font color='#000080'>"Chances are you've still got memories that haven't shook loose yet," Holmstock supposes.</font><br />
[Fri Aug 14 23:50:43 2009] : <b>(2659) Aryk</b>: <font color='#710000'>"True that.  If it it true, that is."</font><br />
[Fri Aug 14 23:51:10 2009] : <b>(2661) Renate</b>: <font color='#000080'>"Or Ankoku might believe that you have," Renate muses.</font><br />

[Fri Aug 14 23:52:23 2009] : <b>(2660) Alan</b>: <font color='#000080'>(You honestly might want to go back through the logs and record the order of all events and Rousseau's and St. Lucien's reactions to them.)</font><br />

[Fri Aug 14 23:55:39 2009] : <b>(2660) Alan</b>: <font color='#000080'>"Well, we're not saying you've still got some secret instructions up in there. Or you're going to get back your memories and also get the old loyalties that go with them. You're beyond that," Holmstock says.</font><br />
[Fri Aug 14 23:55:54 2009] : <b>(2660) Alan</b>: <font color='#000080'>He sounds confident. "I've seen weak men and I've seen strong ones. You're strong."</font><br />
[Fri Aug 14 23:57:40 2009] : <b>(2659) Aryk</b>: <font color='#710000'>"So what do I expect you to do about it?  I don't know.  Like Holmstock says, you've been there already."</font><br />
[Fri Aug 14 23:58:30 2009] : <b>(2658) Rien</b>: <font color='#400040'>"I think that the sentimental connection between Ankoku and St. Lucien goes further than a simple debt.  The histories I read implied a different, deeper relationship there.  If it turns out that I am, in fact, St. Lucien, then that is going to make my relationship with my adoptive father far more... what's the correct term?  Creepy."</font><br />
[Fri Aug 14 23:59:21 2009] : <b>(2659) Aryk</b>: <font color='#710000'>"Oh.  Oh, it was like that?  Oh.  I mean... I didn't read anything about... or, you know, I mean... damn."</font><br />
