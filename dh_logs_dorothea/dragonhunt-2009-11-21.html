Inside a bar and only four tables, and only a handful of patrons, three of them (other than those you followed) are Leopards.  The Leopards you followed take seats at the bar.</font><br />

[Sat Nov 21 11:12:24 2009] : <b>(3979) Reyes</b>: <font color='#000080'>"Good. Now, I've got something else we need -- a small, fast boat, safe on the deep sea. If you can find us that, quietly, we'll pay commission."</font><br />
[Sat Nov 21 11:14:30 2009] : <b>(3978) Aryk</b>: <font color='#710000'>"I can get word to my cousin.  He will know how to get you a boat.  But lady, that's Gull turf.  They look for you on the docks."</font><br />
[Sat Nov 21 11:14:52 2009] : <b>(3978) Aryk</b>: <font color='#710000'>"Let 'em look, then," growls Aryk.</font><br />
[Sat Nov 21 11:15:42 2009] : <b>(3979) Reyes</b>: <font color='#000080'>She nods, thoughtfully. "Fair enough. There's another way. Never mind, then -- and I'll pay commission anyway, for your good advice."</font><br />
[Sat Nov 21 11:16:23 2009] : <b>(3978) Aryk</b>: <font color='#710000'>She grins, bearing her golden teeth.  "Money is good."</font><br />
[Sat Nov 21 11:16:58 2009] : <b>(3978) Aryk</b>: <font color='#710000'>"Three beers isn't good enough?" complains.</font><br />
[Sat Nov 21 11:17:11 2009] : <b>(3978) Aryk</b>: <font color='#710000'>(complains Aryk)</font><br />
[Sat Nov 21 11:17:18 2009] : <b>(3979) Reyes</b>: <font color='#000080'>"Better than no money. So, you have other places around town, yes? Quiet places?"</font><br />
[Sat Nov 21 11:17:55 2009] : <b>(3979) Reyes</b>: <font color='#000080'>"They're risking their lives," Renate tells her brother. "That's worth something."</font><br />
[Sat Nov 21 11:17:56 2009] : <b>(3978) Aryk</b>: <font color='#710000'>She shrugs.  "Sort of.  Nothing... permanent."</font><br />
[Sat Nov 21 11:18:12 2009] : <b>(3979) Reyes</b>: <font color='#000080'>"I don't need permanent. Just long enough for the lizard to think we're really gone."</font><br />
[Sat Nov 21 11:18:31 2009] : <b>(3979) Reyes</b>: <font color='#000080'>"Starting this evening, you know what I'm saying? After our shopping trip."</font><br />
[Sat Nov 21 11:19:33 2009] : <b>(3978) Aryk</b>: <font color='#710000'>"Oh, for you?"  She rubs her chin.  "Yes, I think you can be hidden."  She chuckles.  "Maybe, if you don't mind sharing with dirty gangers."</font><br />
[Sat Nov 21 11:20:26 2009] : <b>(3979) Reyes</b>: <font color='#000080'>Renate grins. "You ever in Ilium, you ask about the Black Sheep. They're mine."</font><br />
[Sat Nov 21 11:21:05 2009] : <b>(3978) Aryk</b>: <font color='#710000'>Another grin.  "I like you.  At dusk, you climb up the watertower.  You drop onto post office building.  Jorge meet you there."</font><br />
[Sat Nov 21 11:22:00 2009] : <b>(3979) Reyes</b>: <font color='#000080'>"And they'll tell you I did right by them. I like you, too. We'll be there. Thanks." She passes the girl a fistful of change -- not gold, because that will only cause them problems, but enough to add up to a good sum without being suspicious.</font><br />
[Sat Nov 21 11:22:02 2009] : <b>(3978) Aryk</b>: <font color='#710000'>The one with the scar nods.  Apparently he's Jorge.</font><br />
[Sat Nov 21 11:23:16 2009] : <b>(3978) Aryk</b>: <font color='#710000'>She takes it without looking at the amound, sliding it down into her shirt.  She stands, and the other two stand.  "I'm Emilia," she says.  "The leader of the Leopards is my brother."</font><br />
[Sat Nov 21 11:23:50 2009] : <b>(3978) Aryk</b>: <font color='#710000'>Aryk sniggers.  "Oughta thank your Lady, for that one."</font><br />
[Sat Nov 21 11:24:03 2009] : <b>(3979) Reyes</b>: <font color='#000080'>"You've heard of me already," says Renate gently. "Best call me Reyes, while I'm here. If I make it back, I'll give you my right name."</font><br />
[Sat Nov 21 11:24:31 2009] : <b>(3978) Aryk</b>: <font color='#710000'>A final grin, and the two follow her out.</font><br />
[Sat Nov 21 11:24:34 2009] : <b>(3979) Reyes</b>: <font color='#000080'>She turns to Aryk. "No, this was your doing, my brother. Thank you. Well done."</font><br />
[Sat Nov 21 11:25:17 2009] : <b>(3978) Aryk</b>: <font color='#710000'>"What?  All I said was 'you guys know the lizard?  we don't like him.  Want some beer?' "</font><br />
[Sat Nov 21 11:25:39 2009] : <b>(3979) Reyes</b>: <font color='#000080'>"All you did was smell a rat. And you were right. Good instinct."</font><br />
[Sat Nov 21 11:27:19 2009] : <b>(3978) Aryk</b>: <font color='#710000'>'Heh.  Yeah, well, not trusting dragons and their spies is nothing new to me."</font><br />
[Sat Nov 21 11:28:01 2009] : <b>(3979) Reyes</b>: <font color='#000080'>"You made the right call. I wouldn't have. As often as I yell at you, I owe it to you to tell you when you get it right."</font><br />
[Sat Nov 21 11:28:17 2009] : <b>(3979) Reyes</b>: <font color='#000080'>She gives him a one-armed hug.</font><br />
[Sat Nov 21 11:28:35 2009] : <b>(3978) Aryk</b>: <font color='#710000'>"Bah," he says, but accepts the hug warmly.  "To the hotel then?  We meet with Rien, and then we go meet 'Jorge' together?"</font><br />
[Sat Nov 21 11:28:57 2009] : <b>(3979) Reyes</b>: <font color='#000080'>"No, not yet. We're going on a shopping trip first!"</font><br />
[Sat Nov 21 11:29:07 2009] : <b>(3979) Reyes</b>: <font color='#000080'><hr></font><br />
[Sat Nov 21 11:29:49 2009] : <b>(3978) Aryk</b>: <font color='#710000'>Well, hopefully I didn't screw up Alan's plans too bad.  When I read his notes last night, there were a few things I was like, "but wait... what if THIS happens?"</font><br />
[Sat Nov 21 11:29:54 2009] : <b>(3979) Reyes</b>: <font color='#000080'>lolol</font><br />
[Sat Nov 21 11:30:00 2009] : <b>(3979) Reyes</b>: <font color='#000080'>Alan will figure it out. He's good at that.</font><br />
[Sat Nov 21 11:30:00 2009] : <b>(3978) Aryk</b>: <font color='#710000'>He did try to plan for us flipping the script, though.</font><br />
[Sat Nov 21 11:30:22 2009] : <b>(3978) Aryk</b>: <font color='#710000'>Yeah, I had to change some things, but it's nothing he won't be able to work with.</font><br />
[Sat Nov 21 11:30:30 2009] : <b>(3979) Reyes</b>: <font color='#000080'>Yup. I don't expect this to work for long... but we DID at least give Skvarce a hell of a lot of turf to search!</font><br />
[Sat Nov 21 11:30:33 2009] : <b>(3978) Aryk</b>: <font color='#710000'>Would you mind sending him the logs?</font><br />
[Sat Nov 21 11:30:37 2009] : <b>(3979) Reyes</b>: <font color='#000080'>no problem</font><br />
[Sat Nov 21 11:30:57 2009] : <b>(3978) Aryk</b>: <font color='#710000'>It's a good thing you guys didn't just warp into the ocean, or I would have had a dragon attack you.</font><br />
[Sat Nov 21 11:31:03 2009] : <b>(3979) Reyes</b>: <font color='#000080'>heh</font><br />
[Sat Nov 21 11:31:17 2009] : <b>(3979) Reyes</b>: <font color='#000080'>we can kill dragons!</font><br />
[Sat Nov 21 11:31:29 2009] : <b>(3978) Aryk</b>: <font color='#710000'>Because Alan didn't plan for that.  So immediately I went to "big dragon fight."</font><br />
[Sat Nov 21 11:31:47 2009] : <b>(3978) Aryk</b>: <font color='#710000'>He did plan on the drum, but not from the comfort of our hotel!</font><br />
[Sat Nov 21 11:31:53 2009] : <b>(3979) Reyes</b>: <font color='#000080'>hee!</font><br />
[Sat Nov 21 11:32:06 2009] : <b>(3979) Reyes</b>: <font color='#000080'>I love how he and we outsmart each other.</font><br />

[Sat Nov 21 11:32:44 2009] : <b>(3978) Aryk</b>: <font color='#710000'>Yeah, it's a good thing he's adaptable.  Hey, no prob.  It was kind of neat running again.</font><br />

[Sat Nov 21 11:32:59 2009] : <b>(3979) Reyes</b>: <font color='#000080'>you should do it more often!</font><br />

[Sat Nov 21 11:35:52 2009] : <b>(3978) Aryk</b>: <font color='#710000'>Okay, then.  Well, I have another player (who reminds me a lot of Alan, actually), and he's definitely anxious to get that together.  If something ever comes of it, I will totally let you in on it.</font><br />
