[Fri Jul 31 23:55:30 2009] : <b>(1779) Aryk</b>: <font color='#710000'>He squeezes her tight again.  "I know, it's alright.  There's more I have to tell you, but it can wait a bit.  Don't listen to Wolf.  He's just talking me up."</font><br />
[Fri Jul 31 23:55:41 2009] : <b>(1779) Aryk</b>: <font color='#710000'>"But I REALLY did need that bath."</font><br />
[Fri Jul 31 23:55:56 2009] : <b>(1775) Alan</b>: <font color='#000080'>Aryk has been told that he does not need to make his membership in the order secret, but he shouldn't make it public either.</font><br />
[Fri Jul 31 23:56:05 2009] : <b>(1777) Renate</b>: <font color='#000080'>"Master Yulias!" Renate makes Aryk put her down. "I'm sorry, where are my manners -- you are thrice welcome, sir!"</font><br />
[Fri Jul 31 23:56:23 2009] : <b>(1775) Alan</b>: <font color='#000080'>And should think carefully before revealing any of its secrets even to his closest friends. Meaning that he could, of course, if he thought it was necessary.</font><br />
[Fri Jul 31 23:56:50 2009] : <b>(1779) Aryk</b>: <font color='#710000'>(Aryk's going to play his membership close to the vest for a bit.  Renate and Rien will know, obviously, but not many others for the time being.)</font><br />
[Fri Jul 31 23:57:16 2009] : <b>(1777) Renate</b>: <font color='#000080'>Renate takes Wolf's horse's reins, the well-bred scion honoring the guest of the manor.</font><br />
[Fri Jul 31 23:57:18 2009] : <b>(1775) Alan</b>: <font color='#000080'>"You do me unjust honor, my lady," he says, with his best bow (which is not really all that good, but Renate detects <i>that</i> as intentional -- he clearly maintains a front of rusticity himself, much as she sometimes does.)</font><br />
[Fri Jul 31 23:58:07 2009] : <b>(1777) Renate</b>: <font color='#000080'>"Not in the least. Come in, come in! We will see you well cared for."</font><br />
[Fri Jul 31 23:58:43 2009] : <b>(1775) Alan</b>: <font color='#000080'>"Kindly allow me to assist you," he says, taking Renate's arm to 'guide' her to the stables whose direction she knows perfectly well.</font><br />
[Fri Jul 31 23:59:09 2009] : <b>(1779) Aryk</b>: <font color='#710000'>'Wait..."  Aryk turns when he hears something, another commotion back toward the village.</font><br />
[Fri Jul 31 23:59:14 2009] : <b>(1777) Renate</b>: <font color='#000080'>She senses a purpose in this, and does not fight it.</font><br />
[Fri Jul 31 23:59:42 2009] : <b>(1779) Aryk</b>: <font color='#710000'>"...Rien!" he bolts suddenly back toward the village.</font><br />
[Fri Jul 31 23:59:44 2009] : <b>(1775) Alan</b>: <font color='#000080'>This gives him the opportunity to say, quietly, "When things have settled a bit, we must have a brief talk in private; there is a bit of business to be discussed."</font><br />
