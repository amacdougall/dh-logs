[Sat Nov 11 19:16:25 2006] : <B>(1) Alan</B>: <font color='#000000'>It happened in between the Fresh Prince days and the Will Smith days, so late 80s.</font><br>

[Sat Nov 11 23:12:34 2006] : <B>(4) Rien</B>: <font color='#4a4a00'>Otherwise I'd be looking for the Five Horsemen, because then we'd have anime with good storylines.</font><br>

[Sat Nov 11 23:12:59 2006] : <B>(1) Alan</B>: <font color='#000000'>Cowboy Bebop is one of the standard suggestions.</font><br>

[Sat Nov 11 23:13:33 2006] : <B>(1) Alan</B>: <font color='#000000'>I'd recommend Cowboy Bebop above Samurai Champloo, but not by much.</font><br>

[Sat Nov 11 23:14:09 2006] : <B>(4) Rien</B>: <font color='#4a4a00'>If I at all got things like Cartoon Network out here, I'd probably watch things like Adult Swim just to see what all the fuss is about.</font><br>
[Sat Nov 11 23:14:22 2006] : <B>(1) Alan</B>: <font color='#000000'>Damn right. Which is actually the problem of Final Fantasy 7 and 8 (and 9 and 10), too.</font><br>
