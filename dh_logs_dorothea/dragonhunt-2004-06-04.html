[Fri Jun 04 21:01:22 2004] : <B>(2) Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>"One from whom something might be learned, indeed."</font><br>
[Fri Jun 04 21:02:02 2004] : <B>(1) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>"I'm always interested in learning," Linetta replies drily.</font><br>
[Fri Jun 04 21:02:42 2004] : <B>(1) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>"Very well then. I shall offer you a proposal."</font><br>
[Fri Jun 04 21:02:55 2004] : <B>(2) Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>"I am eager to hear it, my lady."</font><br>
[Fri Jun 04 21:03:14 2004] : <B>(1) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>"If the Thieves' Guild is falling into line behind Moonshadow, the Ruido Grande's advance becomes ill-omened... but is by no means thwarted."</font><br>
[Fri Jun 04 21:03:55 2004] : <B>(1) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>"The Toy Soldiers still battle my Black Sheep on the streets of Ivy Prime, and your Sol&aacute;n Card&eacute;s still preaches full barricades and military formations."</font><br>
[Fri Jun 04 21:04:12 2004] : <B>(1) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>"The Ultra Box still bows to the sermons of demonic savants."</font><br>
[Fri Jun 04 21:04:33 2004] : <B>(1) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>"The Cosmic Arrows still practice the viperous style of the dashing young Severian Marcella."</font><br>
[Fri Jun 04 21:04:46 2004] : <font color='#008000'>** (2) Renate lets milady lay out her case; it is weak, and even she must know it. **</font><br>
[Fri Jun 04 21:04:55 2004] : <B>(1) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>"The Montequido Group still gives <i>very</i> attractive presentations to potential investors."</font><br>
[Fri Jun 04 21:05:00 2004] : <B>(2) Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>A smile crosses her face at the mention of the Cosmic Arrows.</font><br>
[Fri Jun 04 21:05:46 2004] : <B>(1) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>"The scales might yet tip either way. Bring down two more Ruido Grande footholds, and the Black Sheep will organize and sweep the Toy Soldiers from the Docklands."</font><br>
[Fri Jun 04 21:07:09 2004] : <B>(1) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>"And in the meantime, I will ask my Ruido Grande suitor for time and assurances; another week should not be unreasonable."</font><br>
[Fri Jun 04 21:07:23 2004] : <B>(2) Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>"The Ultra Box are wavering, and I have managed to insert a new style of -- shall we say, crossbow -- into the Cosmic Arrows. I very much think I will take that bet, my lady, on the condition that until conclusions are tried, you allow Master Clybourne to continue his holding actions."</font><br>
[Fri Jun 04 21:08:03 2004] : <B>(1) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>"Very well... if <i>you</i> can convince that mad dog Lan'yarian to leave off his preparations for Armageddon."</font><br>
[Fri Jun 04 21:08:37 2004] : <B>(2) Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>"A difficult man to convince, he is... but I shall endeavour to distract him."</font><br>
[Fri Jun 04 21:08:40 2004] : <B>(1) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>"Last time I advised him, Master Clybourne seemed a little too eager to follow his suggestions."</font><br>
[Fri Jun 04 21:09:04 2004] : <B>(2) Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>Renate's frown is genuine. "I can see how that would present a problem."</font><br>
[Fri Jun 04 21:09:17 2004] : <B>(1) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>"His swordarm has grown weary of martial styles&#8212;he wants to hold Eternal Capital again."</font><br>
[Fri Jun 04 21:09:50 2004] : <B>(2) Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>Renate's eyes lose their focus. "A difficult style to forget, I am given to understand. Even harder to abandon."</font><br>
[Fri Jun 04 21:10:45 2004] : <B>(2) Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>She takes a sip of wine, to cover her unguarded -- and probably unwise -- reaction.</font><br>
[Fri Jun 04 21:10:46 2004] : <B>(1) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>"Surely you understand the intoxication of power," she demurs.</font><br>
[Fri Jun 04 21:11:01 2004] : <B>(2) Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>"No, milady. I can confidently say that I do not."</font><br>
[Fri Jun 04 21:12:11 2004] : <B>(1) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>"Rest assured, then... continue on your path, resisting the irresistible, fighting the unbeatable, and if you are not ground to dust, you will become strong enough to know whereof I speak."</font><br>
[Fri Jun 04 21:12:19 2004] : <B>(1) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>Linetta rises, signalling the end of the interview.</font><br>
[Fri Jun 04 21:12:31 2004] : <font color='#008000'>** (2) Renate stands also, and bows. **</font><br>
[Fri Jun 04 21:12:50 2004] : <B>(2) Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>"Thank you for the honour of this interview, my lady. I believe we are agreed."</font><br>
[Fri Jun 04 21:13:26 2004] : <B>(1) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>"If the outcome is favorable to your faction, your faction will become mine&#8212;I hope this will make us allies in fact as well as name."</font><br>
[Fri Jun 04 21:13:45 2004] : <B>(1) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>"I find much that is admirable in you. Forgive me for seeking advantage where it is to be found." Hard to tell how much of that she means.</font><br>
[Fri Jun 04 21:13:50 2004] : <B>(1) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>But it's ambivalent enough to be real.</font><br>
[Fri Jun 04 21:14:05 2004] : <B>(2) Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>"I am honoured, my lady." Which is true, as far as it goes.</font><br>
[Fri Jun 04 21:14:43 2004] : <B>(1) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>"My sire told me, once, that when everyone seeks what is best for himself, the world becomes easier to understand&#8212;like a series of clockworks."</font><br>
[Fri Jun 04 21:15:04 2004] : <B>(1) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>"Thus, perhaps I am simply doing my part in making everyone's life simpler." She smiles at her own irony as the doorman arrives to escort you out.</font><br>
[Fri Jun 04 21:15:27 2004] : <B>(2) Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>Renate's eyes suddenly light up, a flash of emeralds. "I joy in putting sand in the gears, my lady. I truly do," she says as she departs.</font><br>
[Fri Jun 04 21:15:38 2004] : <B>(1) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'><hr /></font><br>

[Fri Jun 04 21:16:31 2004] : <B>(1) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>Instead of my usual "hide behind cover, take useless potshots, get shot by someone who just ran around the other side of my cover."</font><br>

[Fri Jun 04 21:16:42 2004] : <B>(2) Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>good luck!</font><br>
[Fri Jun 04 21:16:46 2004] : <B>(1) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>Or "rappel up wall, hit button at wrong time, fall to death."</font><br>

[Fri Jun 04 21:17:19 2004] : <B>(2) Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>see you tomorrow, six-ish</font><br>
[Fri Jun 04 21:17:30 2004] : <font color='#ff0000'>Game disconnected!</font><br>
