[Fri Sep  9 19:16:26 2005] : <B>(1) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>"The thrust of St. Delanis's idea," Adam explains, sipping at a cup of Cinnabar's overroasted coffee, "is that the Churches must unite into one, with four disciplines, but worshipping the archangels equally."</font><br>
[Fri Sep  9 19:17:02 2005] : <B>(4) Aryk</B>: <font color='#000080'>"Four disciplines?" Aryk replies, sipping at warm milk.</font><br>
[Fri Sep  9 19:17:13 2005] : <B>(1) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>"St. Delanis found inter-Church factionalism to be the greatest threat to the Sacred Alliance; and second, insularity and patronage within each angelic sect."</font><br>
[Fri Sep  9 19:17:43 2005] : <B>(1) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>"He had a gift for diplomacy," Adam says ruefully, "by which his message won him canonization rather than exile."</font><br>

[Fri Sep  9 19:18:56 2005] : <B>(4) Aryk</B>: <font color='#000080'>"I'm not surprised that I've never heard of St. Delanis before."</font><br>
[Fri Sep  9 19:19:10 2005] : <B>(1) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>"And so, in the annals, the Church is on record as acknowledging the dangers of separation and autonomy between the sects."</font><br>

[Fri Sep  9 19:19:51 2005] : <B>(3) Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>"Well, it's worth considering why not," Renate says. "The status quo enters in, of course, but I should like to know what St. Delanis said about individual inclinations."</font><br>

[Fri Sep  9 19:20:33 2005] : <B>(2) Rien</B>: <font color='#004040'>"There is also the question of how much <i>talking</i> they did on the subject, as well as how much actual action took place."</font><br>

"Consider these men. They are the paradigm of their individual churches. Any plan based on St. Delanis's vision that does not allow for how strongly such as they are drawn to one particular angel is unlikely to gain traction."</font><br>

[Fri Sep  9 19:23:55 2005] : <B>(1) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>Adam manages a laugh. "Well, St. Delanis managed a few reforms, but of course they slowly faded into the background. He was one of those most ironic creations of the Church -- the 'honorary saint.'"</font><br>
[Fri Sep  9 19:24:24 2005] : <B>(1) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>"Only the Church of the Sacred Alliance has the, what's the term? Chutzpah, to create a mortal a saint after his death."</font><br>

[Fri Sep  9 22:44:16 2005] : <B>(1) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>Remember the Mutant Massacre, in which we never really felt like the Morlocks were being massacred?</font><br>
[Fri Sep  9 22:44:32 2005] : <B>(1) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>There were only three or four Morlocks who had names and personalities, and they didn't kill those three or four off.</font><br>
