<p>[Sat Aug 14 18:07:33 2010] : <font color='#ff8000'>(967) Aryk (enter): 18:07</font><br />
[Sat Aug 14 18:07:51 2010] : <b>(967) Aryk</b>: <font color='#800000'>Did you want to handle the bettering of Margolin/Carrackshire relations with Alan?</font><br />
[Sat Aug 14 18:08:20 2010] : <b>(968) Renate</b>: <font color='#000080'>No, I'm fine with doing it now -- I doubt anything especially unexpected will happen. So if you'd like to play some locals, I'm good with that!</font><br />
[Sat Aug 14 18:09:39 2010] : <b>(968) Renate</b>: <font color='#000080'>What say you? :)</font><br />
[Sat Aug 14 18:09:59 2010] : <b>(967) Aryk</b>: <font color='#800000'>Trouble is, I think you know more about the past relations than I do.</font><br />
[Sat Aug 14 18:10:25 2010] : <b>(968) Renate</b>: <font color='#000080'>Pretty vague. The story is that Carrackshire had a beef of some sort with the former residents of Margolin.</font><br />
[Sat Aug 14 18:10:46 2010] : <b>(968) Renate</b>: <font color='#000080'>Nobody's sure exactly what it was, or why it's even carrying on given that Margolin has been razed and resettled.</font><br />
[Sat Aug 14 18:10:58 2010] : <b>(967) Aryk</b>: <font color='#800000'>I don't think I would do them any justice.  Maybe it's better off Aryk enters after Renate's already made a good impression.</font><br />
[Sat Aug 14 18:11:06 2010] : <b>(968) Renate</b>: <font color='#000080'>That's fine with me.</font><br />
[Sat Aug 14 18:11:18 2010] : <b>(967) Aryk</b>: <font color='#800000'>As for Rien, maybe this is a good time for him to be spying on Gillis.</font><br />
[Sat Aug 14 18:11:25 2010] : <b>(968) Renate</b>: <font color='#000080'>indeed</font><br />
[Sat Aug 14 18:11:52 2010] : <b>(968) Renate</b>: <font color='#000080'><hr></font><br />
[Sat Aug 14 18:12:25 2010] : <b>(968) Renate</b>: <font color='#000080'>By the third Renate-bought round of drinks, the initial awkwardness in the Carrackshire common-room seems to be loosening up.</font><br />
[Sat Aug 14 18:13:09 2010] : <b>(968) Renate</b>: <font color='#000080'>Renate knew enough to ask politely for a cheese plate, and has been happily munching through the local varieties.</font><br />
[Sat Aug 14 18:13:44 2010] : <b>(968) Renate</b>: <font color='#000080'>A sheep's-milk chevre earns special praise. "Do you export this? Folk would pay fancy prices for this in Ilium, or Atlantis."</font><br />
[Sat Aug 14 18:14:54 2010] : <b>(967) Aryk</b>: <font color='#800000'>Aryk enters.  Boots and metal shoulder armor / belt buckle / bling polished.  White cloak draped over one shoulder.  Warm smiles for the room.  He looks a true hero.  He assures the patrons who immediately tense up to be at ease.  "I'm just here to visit my friend, that's all.  Everyone just have a good time."</font><br />
[Sat Aug 14 18:15:29 2010] : <b>(968) Renate</b>: <font color='#000080'>Renate stands up and bows to Aryk. "My lord of Carrackshire."</font><br />
[Sat Aug 14 18:16:03 2010] : <b>(968) Renate</b>: <font color='#000080'>One or two of the locals nod; it seems she has chosen a proper way to behave.</font><br />
[Sat Aug 14 18:16:25 2010] : <b>(967) Aryk</b>: <font color='#800000'>"My lady of Margolin," he bows in return, trying (badly) to be formal.  He gestures to her table.  "Let's sit, eh?  That cheese looks bomb."</font><br />
[Sat Aug 14 18:16:49 2010] : <b>(967) Aryk</b>: <font color='#800000'>"It's been, oh, a day and a half since I had any cheese."</font><br />
[Sat Aug 14 18:17:03 2010] : <b>(968) Renate</b>: <font color='#000080'>"Of course. It's my round; what would you like to drink, my lord?"</font><br />
[Sat Aug 14 18:17:46 2010] : <b>(968) Renate</b>: <font color='#000080'>She looks tiny and ordinary beside his immense blinged-out bulk.</font><br />
[Sat Aug 14 18:17:54 2010] : <font color='#ff8000'>(969) Aryk (enter): 18:17</font><br />
[Sat Aug 14 18:18:09 2010] : <b>(969) Aryk</b>: <font color='#800000'>(Ah!)</font><br />
[Sat Aug 14 18:18:15 2010] : <b>(968) Renate</b>: <font color='#000080'>(Oops! She just asked him what he's wanting to drink.)</font><br />
[Sat Aug 14 18:19:15 2010] : <b><i><u>Server Administrator</u>-></i></b> <font color='#FF0000'>Kicking '(967) Aryk' from server... Removing dead client</font><br />
[Sat Aug 14 18:19:16 2010] : <font color='#ff8000'>(967) Aryk (exit): 18:19</font><br />
[Sat Aug 14 18:19:29 2010] : <b>(969) Aryk</b>: <font color='#800000'>"Er..." Aryk apparently wasn't ready for that question.  It wasn't fightin' time, so no milk was to be drank.  And booze was out of the question.  He still had a headache.  "Just some, I dunno... lemonade?  Can I get that here?  Juice?"</font><br />
[Sat Aug 14 18:21:37 2010] : <b>(968) Renate</b>: <font color='#000080'>"Two raspberry lemonades, please," Renate decides. "And another cheese plate, with a half-loaf of the oat bread. I haven't eaten properly since breakfast."</font><br />
[Sat Aug 14 18:22:25 2010] : <b>(968) Renate</b>: <font color='#000080'>She gestures for Aryk to take the chair opposite her as she reseats herself.</font><br />
[Sat Aug 14 18:23:28 2010] : <b>(969) Aryk</b>: <font color='#800000'>"You and me both."  Aryk grins at her; Renate can sense the carefulness of his actions, the weariness, the sadness, and the conflicting determination beneath his surface.  He sits.  "So... what've you been up to?"</font><br />
[Sat Aug 14 18:24:32 2010] : <b>(968) Renate</b>: <font color='#000080'>"Walking around, mostly." She raises her voice just a touch. "His Honor, Mayor Panning, was kind enough to accompany me once more."</font><br />
[Sat Aug 14 18:25:27 2010] : <b>(969) Aryk</b>: <font color='#800000'>"He's a good man."  Aryk lowers his voice, "Bit of a wuss, maybe, but I think he's a decent ally and a good asset to this town.  Learn anything else I should know?"</font><br />
[Sat Aug 14 18:26:36 2010] : <b>(968) Renate</b>: <font color='#000080'>She shakes her head slightly. "He's like my Master Tell, I think. Out of the loop, mostly. Anyway, this was mostly about putting an end to this feud. And making sure you're all right."</font><br />
[Sat Aug 14 18:27:10 2010] : <b>(968) Renate</b>: <font color='#000080'>No matter how quiet they try to be -- and too quiet would be too obvious -- the townsfolk can't manage to eavesdrop on the lord and lady's conversation.</font><br />
[Sat Aug 14 18:28:47 2010] : <b>(969) Aryk</b>: <font color='#800000'>Aryk nods.  He thanks the bartender as the drinks are dropped off.  "Well, you're still here and nobody's rioting, so... I think between the two of us, we can put an end to the pointless squabbling.  I was thinking of finding out what sorts of festivals our town might share.  Harvest festivals, maybe.  A good inter-town hoedown might be just the trick."</font><br />
[Sat Aug 14 18:29:17 2010] : <b>(968) Renate</b>: <font color='#000080'>"Good idea. Perhaps when we finally do for Heliomere."</font><br />
[Sat Aug 14 18:29:37 2010] : <b>(968) Renate</b>: <font color='#000080'>"Ask around a bit about what the festivals are here, and I'll do the same in Margolin."</font><br />
[Sat Aug 14 18:31:06 2010] : <b>(969) Aryk</b>: <font color='#800000'>"That's perfect.  It'll give new meaning to old celebrations.  I'll drink to that."  Aryk chugs half his lemonade.  It wasn't half bad.  Maybe too heavy on the lemons.  "Do you know where we'll find that damned lizard?"</font><br />
[Sat Aug 14 18:31:58 2010] : <b>(968) Renate</b>: <font color='#000080'>"No. If Coris gets my letter and comes here, we can have Sorel look for him. Margolin doesn't have much by way of hunting talent. You?"</font><br />
[Sat Aug 14 18:33:31 2010] : <b>(969) Aryk</b>: <font color='#800000'>"I'm only a novice, at best.  Maybe some of the Longrangers.  But they're hardly at my disposal.  Yet."  Despite the feelings Renate gets off of Aryk, she's rarely seen him so collected.  </font><br />
[Sat Aug 14 18:34:13 2010] : <b>(968) Renate</b>: <font color='#000080'>She nods. "Birch Creek might have a few. Otherwise... I think our best chance might actually be in Kentfield. I know they hunt bison out there."</font><br />
[Sat Aug 14 18:35:33 2010] : <b>(969) Aryk</b>: <font color='#800000'>"Yeah, I think you're right.  Someone will know something.  I'll start collecting information tomorrow, then.  Plus, Rien will have a good shot at finding him.  I think he's looking after some of my... issues... at the moment, though, bless 'em."</font><br />
[Sat Aug 14 18:36:18 2010] : <b>(968) Renate</b>: <font color='#000080'>"What issues are those?" Using her glass to hide her mouth, she says, "I think it's all right to talk. They can't really hear us over their own voices."</font><br />
[Sat Aug 14 18:37:01 2010] : <b>(969) Aryk</b>: <font color='#800000'>"I asked him to keep an eye on Gillis.  My gut says he's the one making the stuff for our boy, and I think Rien will be able to pick up on when he's doing it."</font><br />
[Sat Aug 14 18:37:46 2010] : <b>(968) Renate</b>: <font color='#000080'>"Ah. Good. Pity to lose magical talent, though. There isn't much of that here. It seems to take -- well, a certain economic base, before that kind of talent can be developed."</font><br />
[Sat Aug 14 18:38:48 2010] : <b>(968) Renate</b>: <font color='#000080'>Her hand creeps forward, but does not quite find Aryk's; this isn't the place for him to show anything besides strength. "You're doing very well here, Aryk."</font><br />
[Sat Aug 14 18:40:54 2010] : <b>(969) Aryk</b>: <font color='#800000'>Aryk gives a sort of half-nod, and drinks most of the rest of his lemonade.  "Mm.  If Gillis is involved in what we suspect, it will be no pity to lose him.  In fact, I'll duel him in the town square myself.  I have no love for Glitter, Renate."</font><br />
[Sat Aug 14 18:42:28 2010] : <b>(968) Renate</b>: <font color='#000080'>"Nor I, as you know." She makes a tidy mini-sandwich from bread, cheese, and a slice of sausage. "By the way, did you notice anything curious in the Carrackshire briefing from Cobalt Aerie? Because I did."</font><br />
[Sat Aug 14 18:43:45 2010] : <b>(969) Aryk</b>: <font color='#800000'>Well, Aryk couldn't hold up the act forever.  "Er... briefing?"</font><br />
[Sat Aug 14 18:44:24 2010] : <b>(968) Renate</b>: <font color='#000080'>"The studies they gave us about this place," Renate says patiently. "Who the players are, what the situation is, and so on."</font><br />
[Sat Aug 14 18:44:57 2010] : <b>(969) Aryk</b>: <font color='#800000'>"Oh.  Um... well, you know, with this and that... no."</font><br />
[Sat Aug 14 18:45:39 2010] : <b>(969) Aryk</b>: <font color='#800000'>Aryk gestures to their plates, "I think it's positively freakish to make this many kinds of cheeses in one small town, if that's what you mean."</font><br />
[Sat Aug 14 18:45:45 2010] : <b>(968) Renate</b>: <font color='#000080'>She nods. "It was subtle. I didn't see it myself until my second time through. The briefing speaks of Mistress Wilkes -- you remember her? -- as being 'the only official Silver Coast employee' in the area. The only <em>official</em> employee."</font><br />
[Sat Aug 14 18:46:17 2010] : <b>(969) Aryk</b>: <font color='#800000'>"Yeah.  Actually, I drafted a letter to her.  Still sitting on my desk, though.  Why, what's up?"</font><br />
[Sat Aug 14 18:46:24 2010] : <b>(968) Renate</b>: <font color='#000080'>Her wince is barely controlled. "Don't do that, Aryk! They're proud of what they make here -- and they should be, it's very good."</font><br />
[Sat Aug 14 18:46:36 2010] : <b>(968) Renate</b>: <font color='#000080'>"I wasn't kidding when I asked about exporting it."</font><br />
[Sat Aug 14 18:46:50 2010] : <b>(969) Aryk</b>: <font color='#800000'>"Half of them are, anyway.  The other half tastes like rotted milk."</font><br />
[Sat Aug 14 18:47:40 2010] : <b>(968) Renate</b>: <font color='#000080'>Renate shrugs. "I'm not partial to those either, but some people are. Anyway, if Mistress Wilkes is the only official employee, doesn't that suggest that the Seven Stars have <em>unofficial</em> ones around?"</font><br />
[Sat Aug 14 18:48:11 2010] : <b>(969) Aryk</b>: <font color='#800000'>Aryk freezes mid-sausage.  "...Like who?"</font><br />
[Sat Aug 14 18:49:02 2010] : <b>(968) Renate</b>: <font color='#000080'>"I don't know. I just think we should be careful. Chances are, they'll have planted someone in Margolin, though. It's easier. Most of us aren't from around here, after all."</font><br />
[Sat Aug 14 18:49:27 2010] : <b>(968) Renate</b>: <font color='#000080'>"It's not necessarily a bad thing. It might mean help when we really need it. But we do need to watch ourselves."</font><br />
[Sat Aug 14 18:49:52 2010] : <b>(969) Aryk</b>: <font color='#800000'>"I guess I shouldn't have expected any less.  If anything, the amount of spies in these parts have probably increased since we took over."</font><br />
[Sat Aug 14 18:49:58 2010] : <b>(969) Aryk</b>: <font color='#800000'>"Listen... thank you for your help in dealing with Carrackshire.  Obviously, the three of us are going to settle matters in Birch Creek too, but... well, if you need anything, ANYTHING in your efforts to get Margolin where you need it to be, just say the word."</font><br />
[Sat Aug 14 18:50:46 2010] : <b>(968) Renate</b>: <font color='#000080'>She nods. "We're together on this, my brother, as always. I like Margolin. Margolin and I will do well together, I think, in time."</font><br />
[Sat Aug 14 18:51:16 2010] : <b>(968) Renate</b>: <font color='#000080'>Her smile is a touch shy. "I've got to where I think of it as 'home.'"</font><br />
[Sat Aug 14 18:54:01 2010] : <b>(969) Aryk</b>: <font color='#800000'>"I haven't, yet.  But I feel for the people.  And..." He quiets even more, "...if I can't handle this, then I can't do what I want with the Church, now can I.  I've grown to see this as, like, boot camp."</font><br />
[Sat Aug 14 18:55:12 2010] : <b>(969) Aryk</b>: <font color='#800000'>"I thought I could get what I wanted without having to step up to the plate.  I know that's a stupid thing to think, now.  So I'll do what I can to become the leader I need to be." </font><br />
[Sat Aug 14 18:55:32 2010] : <b>(968) Renate</b>: <font color='#000080'>"What are you looking to accomplish?" she asks.</font><br />
[Sat Aug 14 18:58:09 2010] : <b>(969) Aryk</b>: <font color='#800000'>"I'm going to reform the Church of Raphael.  I'm going to introduce acceptance and tolerance into Church doctrine.  I'm going to re-prioritize the roles of people like me.  I'm going to make the angels STRONGER."</font><br />
[Sat Aug 14 18:58:32 2010] : <b>(968) Renate</b>: <font color='#000080'>"Tall order."</font><br />
[Sat Aug 14 18:59:52 2010] : <b>(969) Aryk</b>: <font color='#800000'>"And... I might just throw it out there that demons like Kahan need a second glance.  That, though, may be be better decided upon by a vote rather than by somebody like me.  I'm still thinking through that one, though."</font><br />
[Sat Aug 14 19:00:22 2010] : <b>(968) Renate</b>: <font color='#000080'>"What do you think demons are?"</font><br />
[Sat Aug 14 19:04:06 2010] : <b>(969) Aryk</b>: <font color='#800000'>"That's not a simple answer.  But I can tell you that, in the beginning, angels and demons were one and the same.  That said, I'm not so ignorant to think the truly evil and corrupted entities of the demonic realms can be 'saved.'  What I'll propose is that things are learned and judgements should be reached through the individual before taking action.  People like me are let loose upon the world fresh out of seminary seeing only black-and-white, when all the world is so much gray.  Faith should be put upon the actions of the judges, but first, FIRST, the judges need to know the truth.  The angels themselves put their faith in humankind to be the judges, and I don't disagree with them."</font><br />
[Sat Aug 14 19:05:04 2010] : <b>(968) Renate</b>: <font color='#000080'>"Wait, wait... could you expand on that last bit? Angels trust mortals to judge? I thought that was just exactly backwards."</font><br />
[Sat Aug 14 19:08:09 2010] : <b>(969) Aryk</b>: <font color='#800000'>Aryk leans in, and takes her hands, "There is still some I haven't told you, Renate.  In the time of the elves, when human slaves bred underground angelic churches, the the war with the wyrm came... well, the wyrm had demons as their allies all throughout the final confrontations.  But the elves fell out of favor with the angels.  No, in the end, the angels chose humans... and for ONE reason.  Humans can judge themselves, and judge others.  The elves were too self-absorbed.  But us, we have what can be called a 'moral compass.'  It's for that reason alone that angels have stuck with us."</font><br />
[Sat Aug 14 19:08:27 2010] : <b>(969) Aryk</b>: <font color='#800000'>"That information is dangerous, Renate.  I have to find the right way to use it."</font><br />
[Sat Aug 14 19:10:45 2010] : <b>(968) Renate</b>: <font color='#000080'>"Oh." For quite a long space, that is all the response Renate can muster. "Well. I think... I understand something a little better." She shakes herself out of her astonishment, knowing that they are still being watched like hawks. "Perhaps you'd escort me home this evening, my lord?" she says, at the pitch that can be overheard. "Will o' the Wisp knows his way, and Dorothy won't let me come to harm, but I would be glad of the company."</font><br />
[Sat Aug 14 19:11:26 2010] : <b>(969) Aryk</b>: <font color='#800000'>"Sure.  I have a new horse.  I named him Buster."</font><br />
[Sat Aug 14 19:12:19 2010] : <b>(968) Renate</b>: <font color='#000080'>She smiles, and reclaims her hands from him. Standing up, she says "I must be off home, gentlefolk. One more round for the road?"</font><br />
[Sat Aug 14 19:12:40 2010] : <b>(968) Renate</b>: <font color='#000080'>This, predictably, receives enthusiastic acclaim.</font><br />
[Sat Aug 14 19:13:01 2010] : <b>(969) Aryk</b>: <font color='#800000'>"I have this one.  Whiskey and lemonades all around," which provokes even more.</font><br />
[Sat Aug 14 19:14:00 2010] : <b>(968) Renate</b>: <font color='#000080'>Renate nods to her brother, one professional to another. She leads a toast to Carrackshire and to its lord.</font><br />
[Sat Aug 14 19:15:08 2010] : <b>(969) Aryk</b>: <font color='#800000'>Soon, the duo is riding toward Margolin at a leisurely pace.  Aryk is explaining the rest of his somewhat newfound knowledge.  "...So I think now you can see why, in the wrong hands, that information is dangerous?"</font><br />
[Sat Aug 14 19:15:40 2010] : <b>(968) Renate</b>: <font color='#000080'>"Maybe. Why don't you explain to me what you yourself fear, Aryk?"</font><br />
[Sat Aug 14 19:16:33 2010] : <b>(969) Aryk</b>: <font color='#800000'>"If someone with enough influence got involved, the power and very existence of the angelic order could be intentionally diminished."</font><br />
[Sat Aug 14 19:16:58 2010] : <b>(968) Renate</b>: <font color='#000080'>"Wouldn't the angels abandon him?"</font><br />
[Sat Aug 14 19:18:38 2010] : <b>(969) Aryk</b>: <font color='#800000'>"Sort of, yes.  But that only carries so much weight.  If the world knew their belief gave the angels life, and decided that they were no longer needed... collectively, I mean... they could purposefully destroy them."</font><br />
[Sat Aug 14 19:19:20 2010] : <b>(968) Renate</b>: <font color='#000080'>"Or purposefully choose to believe," Renate suggests.</font><br />
[Sat Aug 14 19:19:32 2010] : <b>(969) Aryk</b>: <font color='#800000'>"Which is the way I'm going to spin it."</font><br />
[Sat Aug 14 19:21:12 2010] : <b>(968) Renate</b>: <font color='#000080'>"I see." A low-hanging branch scores her cheek. "Ow. Aryk, do you think anyone in particular might challenge you? Is there someone with the sort of influence you mean who might be out to diminish the angels?"</font><br />
[Sat Aug 14 19:22:55 2010] : <b>(969) Aryk</b>: <font color='#800000'>Aryk gently pulls Will-O-The-Wisp in a little closer to him.  "Ankoku.  Part of him must fear what could happen if the Church and the Angels rose against him."</font><br />
[Sat Aug 14 19:23:28 2010] : <b>(968) Renate</b>: <font color='#000080'>"He has little influence in the Church, surely. The Church rose against him last time."</font><br />
[Sat Aug 14 19:24:00 2010] : <b>(969) Aryk</b>: <font color='#800000'>"Even an immortal can't stand up to the power of an order of pissed off divine entities."</font><br />
[Sat Aug 14 19:24:49 2010] : <b>(968) Renate</b>: <font color='#000080'>"We will need the Church again, to fight him," Renate says soberly. "But we will need a Church that is not divided by internal warfare. Don't you think what you're doing will be disruptive, Aryk?"</font><br />

I have a feeling it's going to be pretty damned tense with the College when Adam makes his appeal.  I'll try to be there by his side.  Whether that means I'm there to back him up, there to physically defend him, or there to be the first one to put a fist in his face... well, that remains to be seen."</font><br />

[Sat Aug 14 20:57:41 2010] : <b>(968) Renate</b>: <font color='#000080'>"There are two sides to that. If the Church comes here, they'll be less able to ignore the poverty, the illness, the desperation in places like Kentfield.

For the most part, they simply grow less powerful the further from Andragar they are.  Come to that, maybe I should open a temple to Michael in Carrackshire..." Aryk rubs chin thoughtfullly.</font><br />

What I did out there... I know why I did it, and I've thought it through as hard as ever I can, and I don't think I could have done differently -- but that's not the same thing as believing that I was unquestionably right."</font><br />

[Sat Aug 14 21:12:12 2010] : <b>(968) Renate</b>: <font color='#000080'>"It seems to me sometimes what happens with the Church is, you get two people completely convinced they're right and the other person is wrong, and they're so convinced they don't leave room to hear each other."</font><br />
[Sat Aug 14 21:12:52 2010] : <b>(968) Renate</b>: <font color='#000080'>"Maybe they're both right. Maybe they're both partly right, partly wrong. But can they step back and both work toward what's right? Not if they can't admit they might possibly be wrong."</font><br />
[Sat Aug 14 21:13:58 2010] : <b>(968) Renate</b>: <font color='#000080'>"From my outsider's perspective, I think the way forward for the Church is for everybody to step back and say 'let's find the truth together.'

[Sat Aug 14 21:14:22 2010] : <b>(968) Renate</b>: <font color='#000080'>"And the first step toward it is 'you know what, I might be wrong, so let's talk it through.' Or so I think."</font><br />

"It's just as you say," is what he manages.  "And I have some experience when it comes to the testing of my own morality.  We did... our best.  That means something."  He smiles then.  "At least, so the Angels say.  What happens with the church... well, I have faith what happens willl be for the best, too.  Even if it's not MY way."  Aryk turns Buster around, and starts it trotting back toward Carrackshire.  "Goodnight, sister.  Don't lose faith."</font><br />
