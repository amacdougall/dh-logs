[Fri Jan 20 23:22:06 2006] : <B>(3) Aryk</B>: <font color='#000080'>I want one of those pads where I can draw stuff on the pad and it shows up on the computer.  That would be sweet.</font><br>
[Fri Jan 20 23:22:12 2006] : <B>(3) Aryk</B>: <font color='#000080'>Yeah, nearly two.</font><br>
[Fri Jan 20 23:22:54 2006] : <B>(8) Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>Well, I hope it stops hurting. Constant pain is a cast-iron bitch (and yes, I know from experience, though not with my eyes).</font><br>

[Fri Jan 20 23:23:30 2006] : <B>(8) Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>I mean, I know she draws.</font><br>
[Fri Jan 20 23:23:31 2006] : <B>(1) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>You can get digitizing pads for $50 and up.</font><br>
[Fri Jan 20 23:23:37 2006] : <B>(3) Aryk</B>: <font color='#000080'>Thanks.  It's not constant, but constant enough.  Yeah, I'm sure she would.</font><br>
[Fri Jan 20 23:23:54 2006] : <B>(1) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>It would be a pretty good investment for someone of your skills, but first learn the programs. :)</font><br>
[Fri Jan 20 23:24:12 2006] : <B>(3) Aryk</B>: <font color='#000080'>I'll pick one up as soon as I have the extra dough.  Of course , by that point, people will be drawing on computers with their minds.</font><br>

[Fri Jan 20 23:26:08 2006] : <B>(8) Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>I can do anything but Monday.</font><br>
[Fri Jan 20 23:26:13 2006] : <B>(3) Aryk</B>: <font color='#000080'>Mon or Weds. I believe.  I'll get back to you on that.</font><br>
[Fri Jan 20 23:26:19 2006] : <B>(8) Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>Wednesday would work.</font><br>
[Fri Jan 20 23:26:35 2006] : <B>(3) Aryk</B>: <font color='#000080'>Not soo good at the the looking-ahead thing.  I'll let you all know.</font><br>

[Fri Jan 20 23:28:46 2006] : <B>(1) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>Wait, were you talking about fluffing that Wednesday, or did I miss something?</font><br>

[Fri Jan 20 23:29:03 2006] : <B>(1) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>Oh, because he's out of town on Friday, duh.</font><br>
[Fri Jan 20 23:29:04 2006] : <B>(8) Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>though I suppose we *could* fluff if you insist on not being there :P</font><br>
[Fri Jan 20 23:29:14 2006] : <B>(1) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>Sure, we could do it. Kinda depends.</font><br>
[Fri Jan 20 23:29:28 2006] : <B>(8) Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>we'll figure something out</font><br>
[Fri Jan 20 23:29:37 2006] : <B>(1) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>Anyway, mud factor: you know what a stored procedure is in SQL?</font><br>
[Fri Jan 20 23:29:42 2006] : <B>(8) Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>yup</font><br>
[Fri Jan 20 23:30:06 2006] : <B>(1) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>Okay. ASP.NET works like this: you create a command. You assign it a command type, and some parameters.</font><br>
[Fri Jan 20 23:30:56 2006] : <B>(1) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>And you assign the command a value, which could be the text of your SQL statement... or if the command type is a stored procedure, you assign it the name of the procedure.</font><br>
[Fri Jan 20 23:31:12 2006] : <B>(1) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>Then when you call it, it fills a DataSet with as many tables as the command calls for.</font><br>
[Fri Jan 20 23:31:16 2006] : <B>(8) Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>okay</font><br>
[Fri Jan 20 23:31:37 2006] : <B>(1) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>Then you access those tables by saying myDataSet.Tables[Bad dice format] - [n], where n is the index.</font><br>
[Fri Jan 20 23:31:45 2006] : <B>(1) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>They're numbered in the order the command calls for them.</font><br>
[Fri Jan 20 23:32:16 2006] : <B>(1) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>Now, imagine this: I have some code that assigns a few parameters to a command, and says that the command is calling a stored procedure...</font><br>
[Fri Jan 20 23:32:36 2006] : <B>(8) Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>and you roll the random-number generator, and it's in a bad dice format, and like, whoa!</font><br>
[Fri Jan 20 23:32:38 2006] : <B>(8) Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>:)</font><br>
[Fri Jan 20 23:32:45 2006] : <B>(1) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>...then after calling it and putting the result in the dataset, the code is just blithely calling on tables by their number, without any documentation of what the tables are.</font><br>
[Fri Jan 20 23:32:57 2006] : <B>(8) Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>a</font><br>
[Fri Jan 20 23:32:58 2006] : <B>(8) Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>r</font><br>

[Fri Jan 20 23:33:00 2006] : <B>(1) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>To figure out what data this code is getting, I have to go into the server admin and view the stored procedures.</font><br>
[Fri Jan 20 23:33:01 2006] : <B>(8) Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>h</font><br>
[Fri Jan 20 23:33:08 2006] : <B>(1) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>The procedures aren't documented either.</font><br>
[Fri Jan 20 23:33:17 2006] : <B>(8) Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>wow</font><br>
[Fri Jan 20 23:33:26 2006] : <B>(1) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>So I have to READ the SQL, and analyze each SELECT statement, to figure out what each procedure returns.</font><br>
[Fri Jan 20 23:33:38 2006] : <B>(1) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>There's an undocumented stored procedure for every database call in the application.</font><br>

[Fri Jan 20 23:34:01 2006] : <B>(1) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>THAT is mud.</font><br>
[Fri Jan 20 23:34:11 2006] : <B>(8) Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>yes, yes it is</font><br>
[Fri Jan 20 23:34:20 2006] : <B>(1) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>Nick took one look at the code and said "I think this is going to be a long-term project."</font><br>

[Fri Jan 20 23:34:50 2006] : <B>(1) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>Odds are good this will be paying my rent for more than the original planned three months.</font><br>
[Fri Jan 20 23:35:08 2006] : <B>(8) Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>rent is good</font><br>
[Fri Jan 20 23:35:21 2006] : <B>(1) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>Oh, and I found a nice place today. It has a great view of the sky (and tops of buildings), a hardwood floor, a Murphy bed from the 20s.</font><br>
[Fri Jan 20 23:35:45 2006] : <B>(1) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>And it's open right this instant, which is actually bad, because now Dave wants to move out at the end of March, not the beginning.</font><br>
[Fri Jan 20 23:36:14 2006] : <B>(1) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>I'm going to try to talk him into moving the date back up. I could pay double rent for February, but not February and March.</font><br>
[Fri Jan 20 23:36:30 2006] : <B>(8) Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>he's kicking you out, and he's got way more money than you do</font><br>
[Fri Jan 20 23:36:40 2006] : <B>(8) Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>so he can damn well cut you some slack</font><br>
[Fri Jan 20 23:37:20 2006] : <B>(1) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>Well, once I start getting the checks regularly, I'll be doing fine.</font><br>

[Fri Jan 20 23:37:41 2006] : <B>(8) Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>doesn't mean you have to waste a month's rent</font><br>
[Fri Jan 20 23:38:02 2006] : <B>(1) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>I'm sure I can convince him to move March 1 after all.</font><br>
[Fri Jan 20 23:38:26 2006] : <B>(8) Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>'s not your problem to convince him. YOU are moving out NOW. He gets February rent. End of story.</font><br>
[Fri Jan 20 23:38:35 2006] : <B>(8) Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>And even that is generous, all things considered.</font><br>
