[Sat May 23 01:00:54 2009] : <b>(27183) Alan</b>: <font color='#000080'>The only consolation is that, as far as magic-assisted telescopes can tell, it's incomplete.</font><br />
[Sat May 23 01:01:26 2009] : <b>(27183) Alan</b>: <font color='#000080'>(Insert joke about Dark Eternal going up there to put them back on schedule.)</font><br />
[Sat May 23 01:01:34 2009] : <b>(27183) Alan</b>: <font color='#000080'>("You can tell that to Rubylith when he arrives.")</font><br />
[Sat May 23 01:01:34 2009] : <b>(27184) The Empress</b>: <font color='#000080'>Viviana silently resolves to ask her contacts; surely an angel can manage.</font><br />
[Sat May 23 01:02:11 2009] : <b>(27183) Alan</b>: <font color='#000080'>As a matter of fact, they can't! It's recorded somewhere in the base Dragonhunt assumptions that divine power ends at the extent of the atmosphere.</font><br />
[Sat May 23 01:02:28 2009] : <b>(27183) Alan</b>: <font color='#000080'>I don't know if it's on the website, but it dates back to the Zion game (for the exact same reason).</font><br />
[Sat May 23 01:02:41 2009] : <b>(27183) Alan</b>: <font color='#000080'>So Viviana's answer would be discouraging.</font><br />
[Sat May 23 01:03:33 2009] : <b>(27184) The Empress</b>: <font color='#000080'>She beats the bushes anyway. One has to check.</font><br />
[Sat May 23 01:03:50 2009] : <b>(27183) Alan</b>: <font color='#000080'>To be exact, if a mortal holy spellcaster gets up there, he can cast spells until he runs out of juice, but then can't regain holy power until he gets back to earth.</font><br />
[Sat May 23 01:04:03 2009] : <b>(27183) Alan</b>: <font color='#000080'>You can't just send an angel up there by itself, though.</font><br />
[Sat May 23 01:06:59 2009] : <b>(27183) Alan</b>: <font color='#000080'>Oh, uh, I implied that angels can't get outside the atmosphere because that would let them board the space stations... actually, the reason used in the Zion game was that there's NOTHING there, the Astral Plane and the Mists just end and so there's no "substrate" for angels to exist in.</font><br />
[Sat May 23 01:07:01 2009] : <b>(27183) Alan</b>: <font color='#000080'>However...</font><br />
[Sat May 23 01:07:27 2009] : <b>(27183) Alan</b>: <font color='#000080'>...in this game, I've established that the Astral Plane extends infinitely, it's just airless and terrifyingly barren and hollow.</font><br />
[Sat May 23 01:07:32 2009] : <b>(27183) Alan</b>: <font color='#000080'>So, angels could fly up there.</font><br />
[Sat May 23 01:07:58 2009] : <b>(27183) Alan</b>: <font color='#000080'>I mean, the dragons will stop them from doing any damage, but you might learn something.</font><br />
[Sat May 23 01:08:26 2009] : <b>(27183) Alan</b>: <font color='#000080'>I'm definitely not going to make a contradictory ruling based on plot needs, though. That's amateur hour.</font><br />
[Sat May 23 01:08:38 2009] : <b>(27183) Alan</b>: <font color='#000080'>i.e. I do it all the time but I recognize that I shouldn't!</font><br />
[Sat May 23 01:09:05 2009] : <b>(27183) Alan</b>: <font color='#000080'>Anyway, log off.</font><br />
[Sat May 23 01:09:42 2009] : <b>(27179) Noemi</b>: <font color='#710000'>So if Aryk was aboard the space station, what would Holmstock be able to do?  Anything until Aryk runs out of juice?</font><br />
[Sat May 23 01:11:02 2009] : <b>(27179) Noemi</b>: <font color='#710000'>Okay then.</font><br />
[Sat May 23 01:11:50 2009] : <b>(27179) Noemi</b>: <font color='#710000'>I see how it is.</font><br />
[Sat May 23 01:12:26 2009] : <b>(27179) Noemi</b>: <font color='#710000'>Well, I gotta hit the sack.  Gotta be up early tomorrow.  Goodnight, all.</font><br />
