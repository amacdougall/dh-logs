[Wed May 04 18:08:31 2005] : <B>Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>Random possibly-relevant Dragonhunt fact of the day, which may in fact lead to humorous coincidence:</font><br>
[Wed May 04 18:09:22 2005] : <B>Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>Before the Third Age, there were a bunch of different measurement systems in place, varying from kingdom to kingdom, only somewhat standardized.</font><br>
[Wed May 04 18:09:53 2005] : <B>Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>ah, yes?</font><br>
[Wed May 04 18:10:27 2005] : <B>Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>An ell in one place wasn't necessarily the same as an ell somewhere else; ditto for firkins, hogsheads, acres, and so forth.</font><br>
[Wed May 04 18:10:41 2005] : <B>Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>And let's ignore ounces, talents, and so forth entirely.</font><br>
[Wed May 04 18:11:01 2005] : <B>Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>troy or imperial ounces? :)</font><br>
[Wed May 04 18:11:07 2005] : <B>Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>Naturally, dragons came along, shook their heads sadly, and pinned everything to the circumference of the globe and the specific gravity of water.</font><br>
[Wed May 04 18:11:23 2005] : <B>Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>(Both of which being conveniently identical to those on our Earth.)</font><br>
[Wed May 04 18:12:01 2005] : <B>Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>Crofters and crafters and other down-homey reactionaries said "but we <i>like</i> gallons, and we're going to keep using them!"</font><br>
[Wed May 04 18:12:12 2005] : <B>Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>And the dragons said "No problem! A gallon is two liters."</font><br>
[Wed May 04 18:12:40 2005] : <B>Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>at which point you get the situation in <i>1984</i>, people bitching about pints versus half-liters</font><br>
[Wed May 04 18:13:18 2005] : <B>Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>For a while, you had people confusing "old gallons" with "new gallons" (and the same with yards, acres, etc, which became meters and hectares)...</font><br>
[Wed May 04 18:13:41 2005] : <B>Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>But the upshot is that in virtually every place on the globe now, the old terms of measurement have become just synonyms for the new ones.</font><br>
[Wed May 04 18:13:52 2005] : <B>Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>Someone in Karlbotel talking about a "yard" means a meter.</font><br>
[Wed May 04 18:14:05 2005] : <B>Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>It became a way of preserving a cultural artifact, not an actual term of measure.</font><br>
[Wed May 04 18:14:56 2005] : <B>Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>makes sense</font><br>
[Wed May 04 18:15:09 2005] : <B>Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>they'll never replace the ten-foot pole, though :)</font><br>
[Wed May 04 18:15:24 2005] : <B>Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>And I don't know if I'm going to do it, but I had this image of Lyria handing down temple measurements like Jehovah to Moses...</font><br>
[Wed May 04 18:15:35 2005] : <B>Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>...and ending up with a hilariously wrongly-proportioned ziggurat.</font><br>
[Wed May 04 18:15:59 2005] : <B>Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>Due to the change in what the terms mean.</font><br>
[Wed May 04 18:16:05 2005] : <B>Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>oh dear</font><br>
[Wed May 04 18:16:05 2005] : <B>Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>I think Renate would be too smart for that, though.</font><br>
[Wed May 04 18:16:14 2005] : <B>Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>And it wouldn't serve the story.</font><br>
[Wed May 04 18:16:18 2005] : <B>Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>well, I would think the architects would have better eyes than that!</font><br>
[Wed May 04 18:16:30 2005] : <B>Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>Lyria, for her part, would get a good laugh out of it.</font><br>
[Wed May 04 18:16:44 2005] : <B>Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>besides, a lot of these architecture tricks are based on proportions anyway, which aren't dependent on units of measurement</font><br>
[Wed May 04 18:16:53 2005] : <B>Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>if the proportions got TOO off, definitely somebody would notice</font><br>
[Wed May 04 18:17:54 2005] : <B>Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>You know, people who are amazed at the scale and durability of ancient architecture don't know much of the history of science.</font><br>
[Wed May 04 18:18:11 2005] : <B>Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>Who was it who measured the diameter of the earth by measuring the sway of a pendulum during different seasons?</font><br>
[Wed May 04 18:18:18 2005] : <B>Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>I don't recall offhand.</font><br>
[Wed May 04 18:18:21 2005] : <B>Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>Some sort of mathematical parallax thing based on the earth's tilt.</font><br>
[Wed May 04 18:18:29 2005] : <B>Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>I think I learned that from David's blog, actually.</font><br>
[Wed May 04 18:18:31 2005] : <B>Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>Might have been Pythagoras.</font><br>
[Wed May 04 18:18:43 2005] : <B>Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>Him or Ptolemy or someone.</font><br>
[Wed May 04 18:19:01 2005] : <B>Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>Anyway, a culture that can produce that can definitely apply it to pyramids.</font><br>
[Wed May 04 18:19:42 2005] : <B>Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>And if God hadn't had them constantly off murdering everyone, maybe the Temple of Solomon wouldn't have been wrecked by pissed-off relatives.</font><br>
[Wed May 04 18:19:53 2005] : <B>Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>Er, that parses badly, but you know what I mean.</font><br>
[Wed May 04 18:19:53 2005] : <B>Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>*snork*</font><br>
[Wed May 04 18:20:17 2005] : <B>Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>Killing everyone in your path gives you troubles later down the historical road. Ask Japan.</font><br>
[Wed May 04 18:20:28 2005] : <B>Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>So, on with the show.</font><br>
[Wed May 04 18:20:46 2005] : <B>Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>Log is on.</font><br>
[Wed May 04 18:21:49 2005] : <B>Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>The <i>Silver Bouquet</i> is as sleek and beautiful as its name suggests&#8212;its hull is whitewashed, its gunwhales have shiny steel railings, and its sails are broad and white as the wings of an albatross.</font><br>
[Wed May 04 18:22:32 2005] : <B>Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>There's a strong wind, and the ship practically skips along the surface of the whitecapped sea; it's not for the weak of stomach, but you're making excellent time.</font><br>
[Wed May 04 18:23:25 2005] : <font color='#008000'>** Renate has curled up in an odd corner of the deck, on the border of sleep. **</font><br>
[Wed May 04 18:23:42 2005] : <B>Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>Stingray Island isn't a tourist destination; in fact, Captain Phaerus had to be convinced you wanted to go. But once convinced, with a little extra glowering from Sorel, he and his four crewmen made great speed.</font><br>
[Wed May 04 18:23:45 2005] : <B>Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>Late nights lately; she has learned to snatch naps when she can.</font><br>
[Wed May 04 18:24:23 2005] : <B>Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>The <i>Silver Bouquet</i> usually earns its fares from business travelers who need to get from Sachade or Atlantis to Eridu, Ilium, or the Bay of Hearts in a hurry.</font><br>
[Wed May 04 18:25:36 2005] : <B>Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>In the strong wind, its engines are folded up into recesses near the prow and stern.</font><br>
[Wed May 04 18:26:36 2005] : <B>Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>You're told that when they really need to pour on the speed, those engines extend to a safe remove, and when fired, the aquadynamic fins currently below the surface are all it takes to keep the ship completely suspended above the waves, with only the fins submerged.</font><br>
[Wed May 04 18:27:17 2005] : <font color='#008000'>** Renate stores the information in memory, to share with Sandor Highwind when next she sees him. **</font><br>
[Wed May 04 18:27:56 2005] : <B>Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>Another part of her mind tells over the matters she means to speak with Lyria about.</font><br>
[Wed May 04 18:28:12 2005] : <B>Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>You're nearing the end of your journey now, though; one of the sailors has cried "land ho," though with modern navigation the distance to the island was never in much doubt.</font><br>
[Wed May 04 18:28:43 2005] : <font color='#008000'>** Renate sits up, rubs her eyes, and runs her hands through her stubbornly-particolored hair. **</font><br>
[Wed May 04 18:28:54 2005] : <B>Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>Elapsed time from Atlantis, only two and a half hours; for a normal passenger ship, it would have been nearly a day.</font><br>
[Wed May 04 18:29:22 2005] : <B>Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>Now for it; Lyria's reproaches will be all the more cutting for their gentle manner of expression.</font><br>
[Wed May 04 18:29:43 2005] : <B>Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>Can it really only have been a pair of months since the <i>Kefeinzel</i> went down?</font><br>
[Wed May 04 18:29:52 2005] : <B>Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>So much has happened.</font><br>

[Wed May 04 18:32:50 2005] : <B>Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>(I guess on any well-set-up canoe there'd be a spare oar stowed, but bleh.)</font><br>

[Wed May 04 18:33:34 2005] : <B>Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>The canoe cuts the gentle waves with a minimum of spray, and finally runs aground.</font><br>
[Wed May 04 18:33:56 2005] : <B>Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>After helping you out, the sailor busies himself pulling the canoe far enough ashore not to get washed away again.</font><br>
[Wed May 04 18:34:35 2005] : <B>Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>"I know ya didn't pay us ta watch ya in the jungle there miss, but I'll be glad to go with ya..."</font><br>

[Wed May 04 18:35:16 2005] : <B>Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>(If so, the sailor's more making a polite gesture than showing serious concern.)</font><br>

[Wed May 04 18:36:23 2005] : <B>Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>(The old "women have to work twice as hard" thing means that women populate the legends in a pretty sizeable contingent.)</font><br>

[Wed May 04 19:45:33 2005] : <B>Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>Lyria shakes her head sadly. "It makes sense, but one of my own lost causes... is that faith can some day be divorced from such hard facts."</font><br>

"But if I do have a talent, it's for changing lives, setting people free of old ones. My brother, Aryk and Rien, Talos Clybourne and my veterans... I'm willing to try changing hers."</font><br>

[Wed May 04 20:04:46 2005] : <B>Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>Determination settles on Renate's face. "I would like that. We may fail, but it does seem worth trying."</font><br>
[Wed May 04 20:06:21 2005] : <B>Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>"Selmoral is little stronger than I. Each 'incarnation' -- never a true incarnation in mortal flesh -- he trains only a few, and through their devotion to his memory, feeds on their successes enough to take on an avatar again in the next generation."</font><br>
[Wed May 04 20:07:13 2005] : <B>Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>Lyria looks wistfully at the sky through a break in the canopy. "I wonder what it would be like to truly take on human form... to be born, live, and die..."</font><br>
[Wed May 04 20:07:37 2005] : <B>Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>Sun sparks off her glasses. "No spirit has ever been brave enough to try."</font><br>
[Wed May 04 20:07:55 2005] : <B>Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>"You are better off not knowing, my lady," Renate says softly. "Selmoral Skyweaver never went scant of enjoyment, I daresay."</font><br>

[Wed May 04 20:10:46 2005] : <B>Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>"I can seek him out. The Faerie Realm is open to me, with only the slightest invitation from one of power."</font><br>

[Wed May 04 20:13:27 2005] : <B>Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>She scrabbles around in two pockets, and then her belt-pouch. "Aha. I did have a question for you -- well, another one. What do you know of this?" She withdraws the oddly-colored little flower in its clear bag, and lays it on a stub of column between herself and Lyria.</font><br>
[Wed May 04 20:14:38 2005] : <B>Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>Lyria glances briefly at the flower.</font><br>
[Wed May 04 20:14:41 2005] : <B>Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>"It is not of this world."</font><br>
[Wed May 04 20:15:17 2005] : <B>Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>"Have you brought it before Chloe of the Garden?"</font><br>
[Wed May 04 20:15:33 2005] : <B>Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>"All things green and growing are her domain."</font><br>
[Wed May 04 20:15:54 2005] : <B>Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>"One of her -- well, 'people' is the wrong word, I suppose. Kander. He told us but little; Chloe's dominion stops where this world's does."</font><br>
[Wed May 04 20:16:14 2005] : <B>Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>"Then Chloe's emissaries have confirmed that the flower is unearthly?"</font><br>
[Wed May 04 20:16:48 2005] : <B>Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>"Yes. From Mount Agrias. And from another source we have a band called the 'Agrian Council,' dedicated to the advancement of dragonkind."</font><br>
[Wed May 04 20:16:49 2005] : <B>Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>"If the flower is not of the mortal world, it is not of any of the planes&#8212;for we only reflect and either distort or exaggerate what exists in the human world."</font><br>
[Wed May 04 20:17:19 2005] : <B>Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>Lyria's face shows comprehension. "Ah. Simple."</font><br>
[Wed May 04 20:18:04 2005] : <B>Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>"The dimensional travel that brought the dragons into this world was performed at Mount Agrias... on their home planet."</font><br>
[Wed May 04 20:18:46 2005] : <B>Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>"When the dragons burst into the air, Mount Agrias came with them, occupying the same space far below."</font><br>
[Wed May 04 20:19:14 2005] : <B>Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>"You could say that a 'chunk' of their homeworld, including the dragons themselves, was transported."</font><br>
[Wed May 04 20:20:19 2005] : <B>Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>"I was present during the Dragon War itself, briefly... a few of the elves, when they saw their cause doomed, called on me for help."</font><br>
[Wed May 04 20:20:19 2005] : <B>Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>"So I suppose it only makes sense that a bunch of dragon-lovers would take the name -- but there can't be a direct connection," Renate muses, "because mortals aren't allowed on Mount Agrias. And Sijan wasn't from Northrock..."</font><br>
[Wed May 04 20:20:31 2005] : <B>Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>"I was far too little, far too late, and I choose not to remember..."</font><br>
[Wed May 04 20:20:45 2005] : <B>Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>"I'm sorry," Renate says immediately.</font><br>
[Wed May 04 20:20:50 2005] : <B>Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>"If the flower comes from Mount Agrias, then this 'Agrian Council' has a dragon connection."</font><br>
[Wed May 04 20:21:25 2005] : <B>Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>"Oh, yes, that's clear enough. Though the dragons clearly haven't a unified opinion of it."</font><br>
[Wed May 04 20:21:45 2005] : <B>Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>"And Mount Agrias itself is not on Northrock or Valin, but on the small continent we once called Kashar."</font><br>
[Wed May 04 20:22:08 2005] : <B>Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>(Which, I might add, is incredibly unlikely to show up much in the plot or even get mentioned again. It's just that remote.)</font><br>
[Wed May 04 20:22:20 2005] : <B>Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>"Aha! That explains his accent, then."</font><br>

[Wed May 04 20:22:24 2005] : <B>Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>(yep)</font><br>
[Wed May 04 20:23:28 2005] : <B>Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>"Well, they've taken an entirely unhealthy interest in Rien," Renate sums up, "and I'd just as soon see them take their business elsewhere. Let them fight it out with Heaven, not us. Thank you, Lady Lyria."</font><br>
[Wed May 04 20:25:06 2005] : <B>Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>(We'll have to continue this; there's still at least something for you to address, isn't there?)</font><br>

[Wed May 04 20:25:19 2005] : <B>Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>(No, that was just about everything I had, actually.)</font><br>
[Wed May 04 20:25:31 2005] : <B>Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>(Unless there's something obvious you can think of that I'm missing.)</font><br>
[Wed May 04 20:25:43 2005] : <B>Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>(Oh, the thing she didn't explain... right.)</font><br>

[Wed May 04 20:26:09 2005] : <B>Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>(sure)</font><br>
[Wed May 04 20:26:37 2005] : <B>Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>She straightens her back, shifting to a new (and, she hopes, less lumpy) part of the makeshift bench. "Unless you have something to discuss, my lady, I'm through my agenda. Except..."</font><br>
[Wed May 04 20:27:48 2005] : <B>Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>"In Glenworth. My silly, pompous prayer... 'if you love peace,' I said. And you said 'Don't love peace necessarily, just you.' Thank you. Thank you for that. I think it saved my life."</font><br>
[Wed May 04 20:29:47 2005] : <B>Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>"For that..." Renate sighs, looks down and back up, meeting Lyria's eyes directly for the first time ever. "For that, I would give you -- is my eyesight a sacrifice that would earn you what you need?"</font><br>
[Wed May 04 20:29:48 2005] : <B>Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>Lyria smiles, and pulls back her cowl to reveal plain brown hair, falling in a slightly tangled mantle.</font><br>

[Wed May 04 20:36:24 2005] : <B>Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>Her lower lip is trembling, but she is successfully holding back tears. "Well, babies have to learn to see. I shall have to learn whatever odd twist it is, in my mind. But I didn't mean that. I meant -- what you would call hope. My dream.

[Wed May 04 20:37:59 2005] : <B>Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>"Because now I know it matters to more than just me." Greatly daring, she slips one arm around Lyria's narrow waist and hugs gently. "I love you, my lady. I always will."</font><br>

[Wed May 04 20:40:26 2005] : <B>Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>"I hope it is just a start." She smiles to herself at the words she used to begin that sentence, holds Lyria a little closer for a moment, and then disengages herself to stand and bow.</font><br>
