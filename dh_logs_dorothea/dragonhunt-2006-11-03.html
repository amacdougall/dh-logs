[Fri Nov  3 22:28:54 2006] : <B>(15) Alan</B>: <font color='#000000'>True, but it's not a wound of the type that a normal healing potion would cure. It isn't "damage," more of a malfunction.</font><br>

[Fri Nov  3 22:30:37 2006] : <B>(15) Alan</B>: <font color='#000000'>The assassin saw the unholy explosion earlier, so when Rien stabs the ground, he is already backflipping away, and escapes clean (using good ol' Evasion).</font><br>

[Fri Nov  3 22:34:35 2006] : <B>(15) Alan</B>: <font color='#000000'>(In the larger scheme, Renate taking a couple of curable stun/deafness hits and Aryk taking some HP damage is a good tradeoff for seven kills.)</font><br>

[Fri Nov  3 22:37:29 2006] : <B>(15) Alan</B>: <font color='#000000'>Well, yeah, stealth and trickery is his thing.</font><br>
[Fri Nov  3 22:38:43 2006] : <B>(15) Alan</B>: <font color='#000000'>The assassin is still in motion after avoiding Rien's explosion; Ricard comes at him through the residual smoke, forcing him to fall into a drunken monkey shoulder roll.</font><br>
[Fri Nov  3 22:39:31 2006] : <B>(15) Alan</B>: <font color='#000000'>Aryk is able to complete the pin with his pincer attack, leaving the assassin open for Holmstock's twisted spear.</font><br>

[Fri Nov  3 22:40:49 2006] : <B>(15) Alan</B>: <font color='#000000'>Renate's move; you should be recovered enough to make it down to Aryk and Rien and still take an action, since you have Matrix Dynamics.</font><br>

[Fri Nov  3 22:44:22 2006] : <B>(15) Alan</B>: <font color='#000000'>The assassin's footsteps make no sound, by the way, and he is not leaving footprints.</font><br>
[Fri Nov  3 22:44:52 2006] : <B>(15) Alan</B>: <font color='#000000'>Renate might be able to key into his own body awareness if needed.</font><br>

[Fri Nov  3 22:45:42 2006] : <B>(15) Alan</B>: <font color='#000000'>They have six-foot glaives, which they turn and hold near the base, like pikes; this makes it a risk to advance, but if she gets inside their points, as with a Dust Attack...</font><br>
[Fri Nov  3 22:45:48 2006] : <B>(15) Alan</B>: <font color='#000000'>Is that your tactic?</font><br>
[Fri Nov  3 22:46:15 2006] : <B>(15) Alan</B>: <font color='#000000'>They're leveling the spear-edges at chest height, so a roll seems like it would work.</font><br>
[Fri Nov  3 22:47:28 2006] : <B>(14) Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>Sounds good.</font><br>
[Fri Nov  3 22:48:00 2006] : <B>(15) Alan</B>: <font color='#000000'>All right. Are you attacking them directly for a kill? You should be psyched up to Extend from one to the next.</font><br>
[Fri Nov  3 22:48:47 2006] : <B>(15) Alan</B>: <font color='#000000'>(the alternative would be to cut their spear hafts in half, but they're weakened enough that killing them would probably work.)</font><br>
[Fri Nov  3 22:49:06 2006] : <B>(14) Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>Yep.</font><br>
[Fri Nov  3 22:49:14 2006] : <B>(14) Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>Since Cadash, she tends to go for broke.</font><br>
[Fri Nov  3 22:49:29 2006] : <B>(14) Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>Even if she's the one that ends up broken. :)</font><br>
[Fri Nov  3 22:50:34 2006] : <B>(15) Alan</B>: <font color='#000000'>The initial Dust Attack takes the first by surprise, and you are able to cut him down with a slash as you rise up from the roll. The second manages to retract his spear to a defensive grip as you move to him, but by Extending to a Sunday Punch you're able to beat down his guard and drop him with a cut to the neck.</font><br>
[Fri Nov  3 22:51:40 2006] : <B>(15) Alan</B>: <font color='#000000'>You hear a yell from up the hill; you can't tell if it was Koshi or the archer.</font><br>
[Fri Nov  3 22:52:25 2006] : <B>(15) Alan</B>: <font color='#000000'>You catch movement back up the trail; it's Jindo, limping forward. Seems the initial shot didn't kill him, and he was able to potion up and recover.</font><br>
[Fri Nov  3 22:53:28 2006] : <B>(15) Alan</B>: <font color='#000000'>Next round: Rien's Dragon's Rainbow technique has cured the sense of illness, but his heart is still slowing; his vision is narrowing to a tunnel, it's getting hard to breathe.</font><br>
[Fri Nov  3 22:53:41 2006] : <B>(15) Alan</B>: <font color='#000000'>There was definitely a poison, but the arrhythmia isn't a result of that.</font><br>
[Fri Nov  3 22:54:43 2006] : <B>(15) Alan</B>: <font color='#000000'>The assassin's eyes dart from Ricard to Aryk; when they meet Aryk's, he is chilled to see that they are white and empty, without pupil or iris.</font><br>
[Fri Nov  3 22:54:56 2006] : <B>(15) Alan</B>: <font color='#000000'>Nonetheless, Aryk can <i>tell</i> where he is looking.</font><br>
[Fri Nov  3 22:55:13 2006] : <B>(12) Rien</B>: <font color='#4a4a00'>(Why would that chill him?  Rien looks like that all the time)</font><br>
[Fri Nov  3 22:55:19 2006] : <B>(15) Alan</B>: <font color='#000000'>(Hm, good point.)</font><br>
[Fri Nov  3 22:55:31 2006] : <B>(15) Alan</B>: <font color='#000000'>("He is mildly curious to see" then.)</font><br>
[Fri Nov  3 22:56:30 2006] : <B>(15) Alan</B>: <font color='#000000'>The assassin's left arm hangs useless; he drops the dagger into the snow and, with a gesture, slips a blowgun from his sleeve into his hand.</font><br>
[Fri Nov  3 22:56:31 2006] : <B>(16) Aryk</B>: <font color='#a40000'>(Heh, okay)</font><br>
[Fri Nov  3 22:57:11 2006] : <B>(15) Alan</B>: <font color='#000000'>He aims and blows a dart at Renate; her danger sense goes off just as she's attacking the second hobgoblin.</font><br>
[Fri Nov  3 22:57:25 2006] : <B>(15) Alan</B>: <font color='#000000'>So actually, you can choose whether to dodge without knowing what's coming from behind, or finish the second hobgoblin.</font><br>
[Fri Nov  3 22:57:41 2006] : <B>(16) Aryk</B>: <font color='#a40000'>"Rennie!  DODGE!"</font><br>
[Fri Nov  3 22:57:50 2006] : <B>(14) Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>Finish him. No time to tell what's coming before it hits.</font><br>
[Fri Nov  3 22:58:18 2006] : <B>(14) Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>And if one hobgoblin goes down and the assassin wasted a move on her -- great; that gives Rien and Aryk time to kill him.</font><br>
[Fri Nov  3 22:58:21 2006] : <B>(15) Alan</B>: <font color='#000000'>We'll say Aryk's warning comes in time, if you want to heed it.</font><br>
[Fri Nov  3 22:58:23 2006] : <B>(15) Alan</B>: <font color='#000000'>Hm, okay.</font><br>
[Fri Nov  3 22:58:54 2006] : <B>(15) Alan</B>: <font color='#000000'>All right, then we'll say that Aryk's warning is too late. As the second hobgoblin goes down, you feel a sting at the back of your neck, and you feel intensely drowsy.</font><br>
[Fri Nov  3 22:59:09 2006] : <B>(14) Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>Antidote.</font><br>
[Fri Nov  3 22:59:26 2006] : <font color='#008000'>** (16) Aryk growls, and lowers his stance, ready to pounce. **</font><br>
[Fri Nov  3 23:00:06 2006] : <B>(15) Alan</B>: <font color='#000000'>(Hah. Babygzus freestyled for 90 seconds on my voice mail. Instead of leaving me an informative message.)</font><br>
[Fri Nov  3 23:00:49 2006] : <B>(15) Alan</B>: <font color='#000000'>Renate, you can pop an antidote next round (which will still be in time).</font><br>
[Fri Nov  3 23:00:55 2006] : <B>(15) Alan</B>: <font color='#000000'>Then move or act.</font><br>
[Fri Nov  3 23:01:12 2006] : <B>(15) Alan</B>: <font color='#000000'>Aryk's move, since Rien is coming out of the Dragon's Rainbow.</font><br>
[Fri Nov  3 23:01:34 2006] : <B>(15) Alan</B>: <font color='#000000'>Aryk, you're really starting to get into trouble with this heart thing. You don't know how much longer you can keep up full speed.</font><br>
[Fri Nov  3 23:02:55 2006] : <B>(16) Aryk</B>: <font color='#a40000'>A fiery aura envelops around Aryk as he performs the RIVAL SCHOOLS technique with the assassin.  He doesn't know how to stop the affects of the heart-thing, so all he can do is try and waste this guy before he dies himself.</font><br>
[Fri Nov  3 23:03:15 2006] : <B>(12) Rien</B>: <font color='#4a4a00'>(You could try drinking a heal... *your* damage is real)</font><br>
[Fri Nov  3 23:03:33 2006] : <B>(14) Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>(right... Rien's is mirrored off you)</font><br>
[Fri Nov  3 23:03:47 2006] : <B>(16) Aryk</B>: <font color='#a40000'>(Hmm... okay, well, he can do that and do Rival Schools.)</font><br>
[Fri Nov  3 23:03:54 2006] : <B>(15) Alan</B>: <font color='#000000'>(Well, Rien did feel something get fixed.)</font><br>
[Fri Nov  3 23:04:15 2006] : <B>(16) Aryk</B>: <font color='#a40000'>(So, a medium heal, since I think he's out of bigtime ones.)</font><br>
