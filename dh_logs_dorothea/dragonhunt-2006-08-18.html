[Fri Aug 18 23:17:40 2006] : <B>(1) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>She sits back in a big cushiony armchair and conks out.</font><br>

[Fri Aug 18 23:18:47 2006] : <B>(9) Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>She frowns, and shakes her head marginally.</font><br>

You've got a tricky call of whether to try to sneak the key or just sit tight for Forengil; either one would produce a non-horrible result.)</font><br>
[Fri Aug 18 23:22:58 2006] : <B>(1) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>Log off. Either one would result in the third act starting.</font><br>
[Fri Aug 18 23:23:09 2006] : <B>(9) Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>Heh. I have an idea that Aryk will like.</font><br>
[Fri Aug 18 23:23:14 2006] : <B>(10) Aryk</B>: <font color='#000080'>I say we do both.</font><br>
[Fri Aug 18 23:23:39 2006] : <B>(9) Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>Well, presumably unless we're REALLY smooth, Jodie goes ballistic as soon as we try for the key.</font><br>
[Fri Aug 18 23:23:57 2006] : <B>(10) Aryk</B>: <font color='#000080'>Renate could do it</font><br>
[Fri Aug 18 23:24:04 2006] : <B>(1) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>I actually thought of it as an opportunity for Renate to use her rogue skills.</font><br>
[Fri Aug 18 23:24:17 2006] : <B>(9) Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>Yeah, I've got an idea on that score.</font><br>

[Fri Aug 18 23:26:10 2006] : <B>(11) Rien</B>: <font color='#004000'>Do we need to manufacture one?</font><br>
[Fri Aug 18 23:26:56 2006] : <B>(10) Aryk</B>: <font color='#000080'>The plan is in motion...</font><br>
[Fri Aug 18 23:27:19 2006] : <B>(9) Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>It is a cunning plan that cannot fail.</font><br>
