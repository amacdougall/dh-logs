[Fri Sep 15 19:11:06 2006] : <B>(4) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>Michio Matatabi (whose last name means "The Wandering Life of the Gambler") was the producer who helped create the Purgatory sound; but when Purgatory went political (in direct response to Heaven urging, the story goes), he split.</font><br>
[Fri Sep 15 19:11:23 2006] : <B>(3) Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>And did he go electrocuting other band members?</font><br>

[Fri Sep 15 19:12:36 2006] : <B>(4) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>Actually, he's been doing completely peaceful and apolitical party music, but in interviews he complains that music shouldn't be politicized -- though he doesn't go so far as to badmouth Purgatory directly.</font><br>
[Fri Sep 15 19:12:53 2006] : <B>(4) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>The official story is still that Matatabi split from the group over "artistic differences," and indeed they do very different styles of music.</font><br>
[Fri Sep 15 19:13:05 2006] : <B>(4) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>Anyway, a Durai/Matatabi show doesn't make a lot of sense, musically.</font><br>
