[Fri Aug  7 22:28:43 2009] : <b>(2188) Alan</b>: <font color='#000080'>Renate and Rien's readings have a lot of points of agreement. Renate read lab journals recovered from Robert St. Lucien and Tristan Laurent's efforts to build the portal device, and Laurent's later memoirs putting the period into perspective; Rien read third-party chronicles that nonetheless resonated with him, as if paraphrased from sources he recognized, regarding that same effort.</font><br />
[Fri Aug  7 22:29:15 2009] : <b>(2188) Alan</b>: <font color='#000080'>But what Rien read had a much larger perspective on the affairs of the times, including both elven and dragon political perspectives that neither side would have had full awareness of at the time.</font><br />
[Fri Aug  7 22:30:14 2009] : <b>(2188) Alan</b>: <font color='#000080'>Yes. I'm just sayin' that aside from the obvious and persistent "what's up with Rien" question, you should also be thinking "so where's this portal device now and can anyone get to it" (which presumably would be the reason people care about the swords).</font><br />
[Fri Aug  7 22:30:36 2009] : <b>(2188) Alan</b>: <font color='#000080'>Also, I kind of apologize for having talisman-swords, which are such a fantasy cliche, but at least they don't have combat powers.</font><br />
