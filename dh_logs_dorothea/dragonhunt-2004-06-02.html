[Wed Jun 02 10:27:42 2004] : <B>(4) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>Randall swallows loudly&#8212;one of those cliches that sometimes comes true. He whispers to Sabra, "What's your assessment? Double or nothing doesn't look too wise."</font><br>

[Wed Jun 02 10:31:02 2004] : <B>(4) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>Sandriano walks closer. In the darkness, you can just now see that he's not even armed, except for a silver whistle that hangs on a chain around his neck.</font><br>
