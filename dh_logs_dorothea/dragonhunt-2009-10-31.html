[Sat Oct 31 10:36:49 2009] : <b>(258) Alan</b>: <font color='#000080'>The envelope doesn't have invisible ink, but it does have blue fibers woven into it in a security pattern. Normally that's just so you can make sure it hasn't been tampered with by checking the integrity of the fibers.</font><br />
[Sat Oct 31 10:37:29 2009] : <b>(258) Alan</b>: <font color='#000080'>But these fibers aren't evenly spaced; instead, they're spaced at particular intervals which also correspond to numbers which map to the other most common mage alphabet.</font><br />
[Sat Oct 31 10:38:12 2009] : <b>(258) Alan</b>: <font color='#000080'>And it just says, in the temple tongue, "rotate 19."</font><br />

[Sat Oct 31 10:44:08 2009] : <b>(258) Alan</b>: <font color='#000080'>Taken together, and combined with quite a lot of guesswork, the author has determined that the portal device must be somewhere underwater off the southeastern coast, a few dozen kilometers south of Credo Vallar; the author gives a rough latitude, accurate to "within two seconds," which still leaves a lot of room.</font><br />
