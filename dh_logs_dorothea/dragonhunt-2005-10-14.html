[Fri Oct 14 22:13:18 2005] : <B>(3) Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>"Be that as it may, Father, let me explain a little more. A charity I started in Ilium is soon to build a presence here.

[Fri Oct 14 22:13:52 2005] : <B>(3) Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>"But as I understand things, the Clover District has built this equilibrium over quite some time. It will take a powerful blow to create sufficient instability."</font><br>
