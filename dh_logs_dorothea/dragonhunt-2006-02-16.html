[Thu Feb 16 19:20:10 2006] : <B>(1) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>Or suggest that they subscribe to a data warehouse. Though I guess the latter wouldn't be terribly expensive these days.</font><br>
[Thu Feb 16 19:20:46 2006] : <B>(1) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>Anyway, yeah. There's this guy who thinks he can control a dragon, and even if he's wrong, letting him try doesn't sound too wise.</font><br>

[Thu Feb 16 19:24:31 2006] : <B>(1) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>Rien was just beating on his drum to set up for a mass teleport. It'll take about five minutes.</font><br>
[Thu Feb 16 19:25:01 2006] : <B>(3) Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>"I'm going to try to get out of sight," Renate says to Aryk. "Don't watch me, please."</font><br>
[Thu Feb 16 19:26:18 2006] : <B>(1) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>The opposing mage, despite his thick boots and magical protections, isn't really equipped for the task of climbing the mountain; wherever the terrain gets difficult, he stops dead, looks around thoroughly, then teleports to a safer track with a soft <i>bamf</i> of displaced air.</font><br>
[Thu Feb 16 19:26:59 2006] : <B>(1) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>Rien, are you watching the mage for clues, or drumming intently? If the former, you'll get off the beat here and there, extending the time needed to open the portal.</font><br>
[Thu Feb 16 19:27:47 2006] : <B>(2) Rien</B>: <font color='#004040'>Considering it's going to take quite some time for the mage to reach the top, he's watching for clues.  He can afford the time.</font><br>
[Thu Feb 16 19:27:49 2006] : <B>(1) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>Right now, the mage is out of range of everything except eyesight; he's slowly working in upwards at an angle along the low mountain slope.</font><br>
[Thu Feb 16 19:28:28 2006] : <B>(1) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>After his third teleport, the mage pauses to cast some other spells, perhaps renewing his defenses; Rien can't really tell at this distance. Just like normal vision, he can't make out fine details of magic at that range.</font><br>
[Thu Feb 16 19:28:59 2006] : <B>(1) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>(Also, as we may have covered, really precise magical detection requires him to send his senses more fully into the mirror realm, making him blind to the real world.)</font><br>
[Thu Feb 16 19:29:18 2006] : <B>(2) Rien</B>: <font color='#004040'>(yes, we have)</font><br>
[Thu Feb 16 19:29:35 2006] : <B>(1) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>(Permanent objects are visible in both worlds, of course, so that's not a big handicap.)</font><br>
[Thu Feb 16 19:30:56 2006] : <B>(1) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>Anyway, after he casts those spells, he pauses, and reaches one hand into the sky as if to pull something down from it.</font><br>
[Thu Feb 16 19:31:31 2006] : <B>(1) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>Rien can detect a flow of magic descending to him; but it isn't clear where it's coming from. Closer observation would be needed.</font><br>
[Thu Feb 16 19:31:39 2006] : <B>(1) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>Reinvigorated, the mage continues his upward progress.</font><br>
[Thu Feb 16 19:32:20 2006] : <B>(3) Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>"Aryk, does he appear to be using elemental magic? I have defense potions."</font><br>
[Thu Feb 16 19:32:46 2006] : <B>(1) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>So far, Aryk and Rien have noticed fire, earth, and air magic.</font><br>
[Thu Feb 16 19:33:36 2006] : <B>(1) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>Both fire-elemental and water-elemental mages can muster defenses against fire, of course, but these spells have seemed to welcome and neutralize the fire; a water mage would oppose it by cooling or evaporation.</font><br>
[Thu Feb 16 19:34:09 2006] : <B>(4) Aryk</B>: <font color='#000080'>"Yeah.  Um...  a few, I think.  Hey, I thought I wasn't supposed to notice you?"</font><br>
[Thu Feb 16 19:34:16 2006] : <B>(1) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>It's entirely possible to master all four elements; elemental magic is considered "easy," since its structures are so readily available.</font><br>
[Thu Feb 16 19:34:28 2006] : <B>(3) Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>"When we get there, I mean," Renate says patiently.</font><br>
[Thu Feb 16 19:34:40 2006] : <B>(2) Rien</B>: <font color='#004040'>How long to go on the drumming.</font><br>
[Thu Feb 16 19:34:47 2006] : <B>(1) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>Thus elemental magic tends to have more extravagant effects, but it's also easier to counter.</font><br>
[Thu Feb 16 19:35:02 2006] : <B>(1) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>Another few minutes, Rien.</font><br>
[Thu Feb 16 19:35:37 2006] : <B>(1) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>The mage disappears out of sight over a ridge. At his current rate of climb, he'll be visible again in a bit, though.</font><br>
[Thu Feb 16 19:35:40 2006] : <B>(3) Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>"What was he armed with? Anything besides magic?"</font><br>
[Thu Feb 16 19:35:53 2006] : <B>(1) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>Nothing visible.</font><br>
[Thu Feb 16 19:36:03 2006] : <B>(1) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>Some jewelry and things that are probably enchanted.</font><br>
[Thu Feb 16 19:36:29 2006] : <B>(4) Aryk</B>: <font color='#000080'>"Right."  Aryk gives his temporary blade a few test swings, and scowls slightly.  "Seems to me the guy's unarmed, but I don't think it will matter much."</font><br>
[Thu Feb 16 19:37:35 2006] : <B>(1) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>The planar "fabric" has distorted enough for Rien to open a multi-person portal into the Mirror Realm.</font><br>
[Thu Feb 16 19:38:45 2006] : <font color='#008000'>** (2) Rien give the final beat and puts the drum back into his pack.  With a sweep of his hand his sword manifests, and sweeps a hole thorugh the planar fabric. **</font><br>
[Thu Feb 16 19:38:51 2006] : <B>(1) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>In the Mirror Realm, you can move around unobstructed by temporary objects (such as people); to "teleport" in the sense of faster-than-normal discontiguous travel, you'd have to ascend into the Spirit World.</font><br>
[Thu Feb 16 19:38:51 2006] : <B>(2) Rien</B>: <font color='#004040'>"Let's go for a stroll, shall we?"</font><br>

[Thu Feb 16 20:21:07 2006] : <B>(1) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>The mage is at its origin, surrounded by shieldwalls of magic; a constant stream of energy descends to one hand from a planar complication, while his other hand directs the drilling blast.</font><br>

[Thu Feb 16 20:21:51 2006] : <B>(1) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>Rien could open a portal without stepping through it, but not a small enough one to be undetected.</font><br>
[Thu Feb 16 20:22:05 2006] : <B>(1) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>It requires a certain basic amount of energy to slice through.</font><br>
[Thu Feb 16 20:22:57 2006] : <B>(1) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>The "complication" is a sort of knot, or warped connection, which allows him to draw energy from a remote source. To disrupt it, Rien would have to be close enough to physically attack it with his spellblade.</font><br>

[Thu Feb 16 20:24:01 2006] : <B>(1) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>Another possibility would be to try to analyze it and figure out where the magic is coming from. In Rien's textbook knowledge&#8212;he hasn't seen this sort of thing in the wild before&#8212;the connection range is fairly short.</font><br>
[Thu Feb 16 20:24:20 2006] : <font color='#008000'>** (4) Aryk never learned about any of<i> this</i> in Seminary. **</font><br>

[Thu Feb 16 20:27:16 2006] : <B>(1) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>Following the estimate, he finds the "exit" of the complication; there is a ley-line running along the island floor.</font><br>
[Thu Feb 16 20:27:58 2006] : <B>(1) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>Ley lines are not sources of magic in and of themselves; they are simply areas of the natural environment which are free of obstructions to magical energy.</font><br>
[Thu Feb 16 20:28:47 2006] : <B>(1) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>A mage can make use of them, but usually only in ritual or permanent magic; but in this case, the elementalist is using an existing ley line to draw energy from somewhere else on the island.</font><br>
[Thu Feb 16 20:28:56 2006] : <B>(1) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>Simply as a convenient conduit.</font><br>

[Thu Feb 16 20:30:21 2006] : <B>(2) Rien</B>: <font color='#004040'>You said they're typically short-range</font><br>
[Thu Feb 16 20:31:00 2006] : <B>(1) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>The range depends on the power drawn versus the power used; generally, anything over a kilometer or two in range will consume as much energy as it provides.</font><br>
[Thu Feb 16 20:31:15 2006] : <B>(1) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>It seems like the power source is on the island.</font><br>

[Thu Feb 16 20:36:02 2006] : <B>(1) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>Well, it would depend on how fast you moved. The ley line leads back the way you came; you've already cleared a bit of a path.</font><br>
[Thu Feb 16 20:36:15 2006] : <B>(1) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>And if you really put some risk into it, you can move quite quickly.</font><br>
[Thu Feb 16 20:36:49 2006] : <B>(1) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>Just blitzing the mage isn't a terrible idea either. From your perspective, both seem reasonable; they just involve different risks.</font><br>
