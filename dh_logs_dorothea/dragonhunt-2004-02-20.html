[Fri Feb 20 18:38:12 2004] : <B>(2) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>These "legal entanglements" actually caused a chain reaction that has condemned the man to death.</font><br>

[Fri Feb 20 18:43:58 2004] : <B>(2) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>This report on the Thieves' Guild says that part of the reason Sturge was convicted is that he refused to exonerate himself even when he could have.</font><br>

[Fri Feb 20 18:44:36 2004] : <B>(2) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>There was exculpatory evidence that was simply never brought to light, or was actively suppressed by the Thieves' Guild.</font><br>

[Fri Feb 20 18:45:47 2004] : <B>(2) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>At least, in that guild. All available evidence, not just legends and stories, suggests that members of the Thieves' Guilds of the Silver Coast develop strong bonds.</font><br>

[Fri Feb 20 21:12:14 2004] : <B>(1) Jenny</B>: <font color='#000080'>boy, when Jenny gets her head back on straight, it'll give her a lot to think about</font><br>

[Fri Feb 20 21:12:31 2004] : <B>(3) Rien</B>: <font color='#804000'>I ownder if I could convince Rann to try probing Rien's mind</font><br>
[Fri Feb 20 21:12:35 2004] : <B>(2) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>The question is whether Rien's deeper self would care enough to tell anyone.</font><br>
[Fri Feb 20 21:12:38 2004] : <B>(1) Jenny</B>: <font color='#000080'>heh! mousetrap!</font><br>
[Fri Feb 20 21:12:55 2004] : <B>(1) Jenny</B>: <font color='#000080'>nice thinking</font><br>
[Fri Feb 20 21:13:07 2004] : <B>(2) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>So far, Rien's secret side has only fought for Rien's life (a very reasonable action for any entity) or leaked semi-useful knowledge into Rien's head.</font><br>

[Fri Feb 20 21:13:27 2004] : <B>(1) Jenny</B>: <font color='#000080'>And solved a chess problem. :)</font><br>
[Fri Feb 20 21:13:39 2004] : <B>(1) Jenny</B>: <font color='#000080'>I guess even secret sides get bored.</font><br>
[Fri Feb 20 21:13:41 2004] : <B>(2) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>Knowing Rien's secret, I'm going to rule that the deeper personality would <em>not</em> see fit to involve itself in this particular concern.</font><br>
[Fri Feb 20 21:14:09 2004] : <B>(2) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>That will make sense later, by the way.</font><br>
[Fri Feb 20 21:14:23 2004] : <B>(3) Rien</B>: <font color='#804000'>But, would it see fit to tell Jenny about it though</font><br>
[Fri Feb 20 21:14:34 2004] : <B>(2) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>Not "end of the chapter" later, but "finding out what the hell is up with Rien" later.</font><br>

[Fri Feb 20 21:15:33 2004] : <B>(1) Jenny</B>: <font color='#000080'>oh, man, freaky... Jenny'll absolutely plotz.</font><br>
[Fri Feb 20 21:15:50 2004] : <B>(2) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>You know, I guess Rien's mysterious side <em>would</em> tell Jenny.</font><br>

[Fri Feb 20 21:15:58 2004] : <B>(2) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>I'll handle that next time it manifests.</font><br>

[Fri Feb 20 21:17:10 2004] : <B>(1) Jenny</B>: <font color='#000080'>nah, because she doesn't understand why Trancey Rien would take any kind of an interest</font><br>
[Fri Feb 20 21:17:20 2004] : <B>(1) Jenny</B>: <font color='#000080'>that's just WEIRD, man, weird</font><br>
[Fri Feb 20 21:18:19 2004] : <B>(1) Jenny</B>: <font color='#000080'>and Jenny's had a hell of a lot of weird to deal with lately</font><br>
[Fri Feb 20 21:18:33 2004] : <B>(1) Jenny</B>: <font color='#000080'>from surreal cream pies to dying to Trancey Rien</font><br>
[Fri Feb 20 21:18:45 2004] : <B>(1) Jenny</B>: <font color='#000080'>(though I guess she doesn't remember the surreal cream pie)</font><br>
[Fri Feb 20 21:18:56 2004] : <B>(3) Rien</B>: <font color='#804000'>Well, she's about ot get alot more when she sees Rien's 'transformation' for the first time again</font><br>
[Fri Feb 20 21:19:11 2004] : <B>(2) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>Well, without spoiling the gigantic character-defining mystery of who or what Trancey Rien is, I can say that Trancey Rien doesn't mind helping his conscious half out a little.</font><br>
[Fri Feb 20 21:19:18 2004] : <B>(1) Jenny</B>: <font color='#000080'>heh</font><br>
[Fri Feb 20 21:19:34 2004] : <B>(1) Jenny</B>: <font color='#000080'>yeah, I'm actually sort of enjoying playing things twice</font><br>
[Fri Feb 20 21:19:45 2004] : <B>(3) Rien</B>: <font color='#804000'>I'm thinking of making this transformation even more spectacular that normal.</font><br>
[Fri Feb 20 21:19:53 2004] : <B>(2) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>Actually, when they finally merge around Chapter 5 or so, you'll lose that last-ditch buffer against mind magic. Alas.</font><br>
[Fri Feb 20 21:20:10 2004] : <B>(1) Jenny</B>: <font color='#000080'>wow, that early?</font><br>
[Fri Feb 20 21:20:18 2004] : <B>(1) Jenny</B>: <font color='#000080'>cool</font><br>
[Fri Feb 20 21:20:32 2004] : <B>(2) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>I shouldn't say "merge" -- I should say "when Rien gains the ability to use his full powers without a transition or memory loss."</font><br>
[Fri Feb 20 21:20:44 2004] : <B>(1) Jenny</B>: <font color='#000080'>fair enough</font><br>
[Fri Feb 20 21:20:47 2004] : <B>(3) Rien</B>: <font color='#804000'>polychromatic light, lightning, thunder</font><br>
[Fri Feb 20 21:21:00 2004] : <B>(2) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>For Rien, "levelling up" is actually the gradual increase of his ability to consciously channel his mysterious powers.</font><br>
[Fri Feb 20 21:21:17 2004] : <B>(2) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>Right now, his mind can't even handle it. He has to enter a different level of consciousness.</font><br>
[Fri Feb 20 21:21:37 2004] : <B>(1) Jenny</B>: <font color='#000080'>whoa</font><br>
[Fri Feb 20 21:21:39 2004] : <B>(2) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>It's not that he'll merge with his mysterious side; it's that the mysterious side won't need to take control in order for him to use his powers.</font><br>
[Fri Feb 20 21:21:41 2004] : <B>(1) Jenny</B>: <font color='#000080'>scary</font><br>
[Fri Feb 20 21:21:58 2004] : <B>(1) Jenny</B>: <font color='#000080'>I think Jenny will be very very glad she's basically a normal kid.</font><br>
[Fri Feb 20 21:22:06 2004] : <B>(2) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>The BIG revelation, when he finally either comes fully to terms with himself or dies, happens around chapter 15.</font><br>
[Fri Feb 20 21:22:12 2004] : <B>(2) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>He'll have a pretty good idea what's up before then, though.</font><br>
[Fri Feb 20 21:22:35 2004] : <B>(2) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>I hope that was informative without being a spoiler.</font><br>
[Fri Feb 20 21:22:46 2004] : <B>(1) Jenny</B>: <font color='#000080'>I think so.</font><br>
[Fri Feb 20 21:22:56 2004] : <B>(3) Rien</B>: <font color='#804000'>Yeah.</font><br>
[Fri Feb 20 21:23:02 2004] : <B>(1) Jenny</B>: <font color='#000080'>As I said, it's good to be the normal one in the party. :)</font><br>
[Fri Feb 20 21:23:21 2004] : <B>(3) Rien</B>: <font color='#804000'>You and aryk are going ot basically be the only two normal ones</font><br>
[Fri Feb 20 21:23:28 2004] : <B>(1) Jenny</B>: <font color='#000080'>Aryk, normal?</font><br>
[Fri Feb 20 21:23:30 2004] : <B>(1) Jenny</B>: <font color='#000080'>Perish the thought.</font><br>
[Fri Feb 20 21:23:40 2004] : <B>(1) Jenny</B>: <font color='#000080'>Aryk's a PALADIN!</font><br>
[Fri Feb 20 21:23:52 2004] : <B>(3) Rien</B>: <font color='#804000'>Yes...but he started out normal</font><br>
[Fri Feb 20 21:23:55 2004] : <B>(1) Jenny</B>: <font color='#000080'>The Greatest Paladin In The World, Ever.</font><br>
[Fri Feb 20 21:24:01 2004] : <B>(1) Jenny</B>: <font color='#000080'>or something like that</font><br>
[Fri Feb 20 21:24:15 2004] : <B>(1) Jenny</B>: <font color='#000080'>yeah, but Aryk doesn't *want* to be normal</font><br>
[Fri Feb 20 21:24:17 2004] : <B>(1) Jenny</B>: <font color='#000080'>Jenny does</font><br>
[Fri Feb 20 21:24:19 2004] : <B>(1) Jenny</B>: <font color='#000080'>very much</font><br>
[Fri Feb 20 21:24:33 2004] : <B>(2) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>Oh, and you'll note that even when Rien gets the ability to consciously use his powers, he'll still have <em>greater</em> powers that his trance side could use by manifesting itself. And it might, in emergencies.</font><br>
[Fri Feb 20 21:24:43 2004] : <B>(1) Jenny</B>: <font color='#000080'>heh</font><br>
[Fri Feb 20 21:24:50 2004] : <B>(1) Jenny</B>: <font color='#000080'>we keep not being able to avoid emergencies</font><br>

[Fri Feb 20 21:25:40 2004] : <B>(1) Dorothea</B>: <font color='#000080'>that'll break Renate up pretty badly</font><br>
[Fri Feb 20 21:25:57 2004] : <B>(2) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>I've warned Adrian that even if Rien does "get a grip on himself," he might not be a playable character after that.</font><br>

[Fri Feb 20 21:26:23 2004] : <B>(2) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>I leave it up to your imagination what might cause that. (shrug)</font><br>
[Fri Feb 20 21:26:40 2004] : <B>(1) Dorothea</B>: <font color='#000080'>Well, there are several versions of not playable.</font><br>
[Fri Feb 20 21:26:45 2004] : <B>(1) Dorothea</B>: <font color='#000080'>There's "totally wigged out."</font><br>

[Fri Feb 20 21:28:28 2004] : <B>(1) Dorothea</B>: <font color='#000080'>I was afraid you were going there.</font><br>
[Fri Feb 20 21:28:35 2004] : <B>(1) Dorothea</B>: <font color='#000080'>I have my own suspicions about what Trancey Rien is.</font><br>
[Fri Feb 20 21:28:40 2004] : <B>(1) Dorothea</B>: <font color='#000080'>That tends to go along with them.</font><br>
[Fri Feb 20 21:28:45 2004] : <B>(2) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>Well, no peeking.</font><br>
[Fri Feb 20 21:28:50 2004] : <B>(1) Dorothea</B>: <font color='#000080'>Yeah, I know.</font><br>
[Fri Feb 20 21:28:59 2004] : <B>(1) Dorothea</B>: <font color='#000080'>Ugh. Poor Renate.</font><br>

[Fri Feb 20 21:29:13 2004] : <B>(1) Dorothea</B>: <font color='#000080'>True, there is that.</font><br>
[Fri Feb 20 21:29:16 2004] : <B>(2) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>Yeah, that's another one.</font><br>
[Fri Feb 20 21:29:17 2004] : <B>(2) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>It'll probably be a combination of a few of those, anyway.</font><br>
[Fri Feb 20 21:29:35 2004] : <B>(3) Rien</B>: <font color='#804000'>I'm hoping for that one actually</font><br>
[Fri Feb 20 21:29:41 2004] : <B>(2) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>Well, it's fourteen chapters in the future. Who knows if we'll even be alive by then?</font><br>

[Fri Feb 20 21:29:59 2004] : <B>(1) Dorothea</B>: <font color='#000080'>Well, Renate will always welcome the help, I think.</font><br>
[Fri Feb 20 21:30:13 2004] : <B>(3) Rien</B>: <font color='#804000'>Hopefully we can manage to compress some of the cahpaters so they don't take a long, long tme each</font><br>
[Fri Feb 20 21:30:14 2004] : <B>(1) Dorothea</B>: <font color='#000080'>Unless Rien's personality changes so drastically that he really isn't Rien any longer.</font><br>
[Fri Feb 20 21:30:36 2004] : <B>(2) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>Well, this chapter is taking longer than most of the others are expected to.</font><br>
[Fri Feb 20 21:30:37 2004] : <B>(1) Dorothea</B>: <font color='#000080'>I like the pace, actually.</font><br>
[Fri Feb 20 21:30:49 2004] : <B>(2) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>But I like being able to just putter around and chat with people.</font><br>
[Fri Feb 20 21:30:49 2004] : <B>(1) Dorothea</B>: <font color='#000080'>There's time to play out character stuff. Like the scene with Kligh.</font><br>
[Fri Feb 20 21:31:02 2004] : <B>(2) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>I commented on it to Adrian when we were playing Dannyl's prologue so long ago.</font><br>

[Fri Feb 20 21:31:20 2004] : <B>(2) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>Favorite-favorite is the big set-piece stuff, full of revelations and excitement.</font><br>
[Fri Feb 20 21:31:28 2004] : <B>(2) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>Like the latter parts of Aryk's prologue.</font><br>
[Fri Feb 20 21:32:31 2004] : <B>(2) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>Chapters 4, 5, and 6 will be a bit like that, 5 in particular.</font><br>
