[Fri Mar 31 22:09:30 2006] : <B>(1) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>Well, I'm hoping it'll be a matter of "put soap on sponge, wipe object with sponge, watch goo go bye"</font><br>

[Fri Mar 31 22:10:43 2006] : <B>(1) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>Depends on the location. There's some refrigerator goo, from parts we just never looked at; some bathroom behind-the-toilet goo; some kitchen counter goo; a small amount of stove goo.</font><br>
[Fri Mar 31 22:10:55 2006] : <B>(1) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>But stove goo is often the most intractable.</font><br>
