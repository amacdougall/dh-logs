[Fri Feb 13 18:18:53 2004] : <B>(1) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>There's an epic fantasy series called "The Wheel of Time," which started out very promising and has degenerated into a sodden mass of overbaked potential.</font><br>

[Fri Feb 13 18:19:21 2004] : <B>(1) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>If you read the first five books, it looks like they're well on track to finish up something quite competent (if not 100% fresh and new) by around book 7...</font><br>
[Fri Feb 13 18:19:36 2004] : <B>(1) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>They're on book 10 now, and with more loose ends than in book 5.</font><br>
[Fri Feb 13 18:19:37 2004] : <B>(3) Jenny</B>: <font color='#000080'>maybe Adrian thinks we're starting at 7?</font><br>
[Fri Feb 13 18:20:07 2004] : <B>(1) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>In book 9, literally THREE important things happened. Entire major plot branches weren't touched on at all.</font><br>
[Fri Feb 13 18:21:05 2004] : <B>(2) Aryk</B>: <font color='#000080'>Hmmm... that's not healthy reading.</font><br>
[Fri Feb 13 18:21:26 2004] : <B>(2) Aryk</B>: <font color='#000080'>If any of you haven't read the Discworld series, though, I highly recommend it.</font><br>
[Fri Feb 13 18:21:29 2004] : <B>(1) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>Anyway, the upshot is that it used to be a love-it-or-hate-it thing -- some people thought the author had brought a certain rosy freshness to hackneyed epic-fantasy concepts.</font><br>
[Fri Feb 13 18:21:41 2004] : <B>(1) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>Some people thought they were just hackneyed epic-fantasy concepts. :)</font><br>
[Fri Feb 13 18:22:34 2004] : <B>(1) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>But now even the original fans are just out there doing their best. And yes, we know the hell out of some Discworld.</font><br>
[Fri Feb 13 18:23:10 2004] : <B>(1) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>Starting with Guards! Guards! and running up through, I don't know, four or five books before the most recent, it's some of the best satire there is.</font><br>
[Fri Feb 13 18:23:34 2004] : <B>(2) Aryk</B>: <font color='#000080'>I have really gotten back into reading because of the series.  I'm on my eight book now I think.  </font><br>
[Fri Feb 13 18:23:40 2004] : <B>(1) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>Before Guards! Guards!, he hadn't quite hit his stride; and in the last half-dozen, he seems too easy in his gait.</font><br>
[Fri Feb 13 18:23:54 2004] : <B>(2) Aryk</B>: <font color='#000080'>Yeah, I read some of the more recent ones, and now I'm at the beginning of the series.  </font><br>
[Fri Feb 13 18:24:10 2004] : <B>(2) Aryk</B>: <font color='#000080'>Yeah, I know what you mean, but the earliest ones are stilll drawing me in.</font><br>
[Fri Feb 13 18:24:30 2004] : <B>(1) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>But some of them in there are easily comparable to grand masters like Wodehouse and Wilde. Not equal, mind you, but you can mention them in the same breath without insulting anyone.</font><br>
[Fri Feb 13 18:24:33 2004] : <B>(3) Jenny</B>: <font color='#000080'>I've read the ones I've read so out of order that I have no idea where to situate them.</font><br>
[Fri Feb 13 18:24:51 2004] : <B>(3) Jenny</B>: <font color='#000080'>But they struck me as uneven. Some of it was laugh-out-loud great, and some of it was eh.</font><br>
[Fri Feb 13 18:25:33 2004] : <B>(2) Aryk</B>: <font color='#000080'>I've only read one thus far that was "eh," but it still had a lot of great concepts that made it worthwhile to me.</font><br>
[Fri Feb 13 18:25:53 2004] : <B>(1) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>Right -- the real genius is that as he starts to settle in with some of the characters, Vimes in particular, he makes them more human than simply talking heads in a parody.</font><br>
[Fri Feb 13 18:26:08 2004] : <B>(3) Jenny</B>: <font color='#000080'>agreed</font><br>
[Fri Feb 13 18:26:19 2004] : <B>(1) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>Comedy aside, there are moments of pathos, drama, grandeur, and, in a word, whatnot.</font><br>

[Fri Feb 13 18:26:38 2004] : <B>(1) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>Ahem, on to coffee.</font><br>
[Fri Feb 13 18:26:48 2004] : <B>(2) Aryk</B>: <font color='#000080'>Yes, Vimes rocks.</font><br>
[Fri Feb 13 18:26:55 2004] : <B>(2) Aryk</B>: <font color='#000080'>But I think it make a great atmoshpere for an RPG.</font><br>

[Fri Feb 13 18:27:22 2004] : <B>(1) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>Ah, so you're running a Discworld game? Not a bad idea.</font><br>

[Fri Feb 13 18:33:53 2004] : <B>(2) Aryk</B>: <font color='#000080'>To backtrack, I think I have a certain knack for writing in the style of other authors.  Actually, I think after reading so much Pratchett, it just sort of "comes out"</font><br>
[Fri Feb 13 18:34:06 2004] : <B>(3) Jenny</B>: <font color='#000080'>pastiche, yes</font><br>
[Fri Feb 13 18:34:19 2004] : <B>(1) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>Yes, it's easy to get into another author's head after a while, especially if you've been reading nothing but.</font><br>

[Fri Feb 13 18:39:40 2004] : <B>(1) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>Well, I read a fourth one, and now I can't for the life of me remember which.</font><br>

[Fri Feb 13 18:41:21 2004] : <B>(1) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>I'm honestly finding Shaw's forewords more interesting than the plays themselves. The plays were one way of expressing his political views -- but it is the views themselves, and their expression that interests me most.</font><br>
[Fri Feb 13 18:41:35 2004] : <B>(1) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>I should probably just read a book of his essays.</font><br>

[Fri Feb 13 18:50:07 2004] : <B>(1) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>Okay, let's get started.</font><br>
[Fri Feb 13 18:50:11 2004] : <B>(2) Aryk</B>: <font color='#000080'>Yes.</font><br>
[Fri Feb 13 18:50:39 2004] : <B>(3) Jenny</B>: <font color='#000080'>yup</font><br>
[Fri Feb 13 18:50:51 2004] : <B>(1) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>Log is on.</font><br>
[Fri Feb 13 18:51:36 2004] : <B>(1) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>Jenny, you're left to your own devices on the ground floor of police headquarters. Rien is going to take a few more hours to re-familiarize himself with the case, and to sort out whatever perpetual muddle his head is in.</font><br>
[Fri Feb 13 18:51:59 2004] : <B>(2) Aryk</B>: <font color='#000080'>(More than usual, that is)</font><br>
[Fri Feb 13 18:52:06 2004] : <B>(3) Jenny</B>: <font color='#000080'>Sounds good to Jenny. She'll take whatever folders he isn't looking at.</font><br>
[Fri Feb 13 18:52:14 2004] : <B>(3) Jenny</B>: <font color='#000080'>Or talk to Hien if he's got time -- whatever.</font><br>
[Fri Feb 13 18:52:38 2004] : <B>(1) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>They told you that although Aryk hasn't been found dead or alive, he's more likely to turn up at a church of Michael than anywhere else.</font><br>
[Fri Feb 13 18:52:52 2004] : <B>(3) Jenny</B>: <font color='#000080'>Hm. Where are the nearest ones?</font><br>
[Fri Feb 13 18:53:32 2004] : <B>(1) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>The largest church of Michael in Ilium is very near the Gate of Heaven. It's a guardpost, like most churches of Michael, meant to assist against hypothetical invasion.</font><br>
[Fri Feb 13 18:54:02 2004] : <B>(2) Aryk</B>: <font color='#000080'>Sounds like where I'd be, for sure.</font><br>
[Fri Feb 13 18:54:08 2004] : <B>(1) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>Michael doesn't have large churches within cities -- the militant order tends to have its own castles dotted throughout the lands.</font><br>
[Fri Feb 13 18:54:37 2004] : <B>(3) Jenny</B>: <font color='#000080'>Ah. Well. Hadn't been planning to go in that direction, but Jenny supposes she'd better.</font><br>
[Fri Feb 13 18:54:56 2004] : <B>(3) Jenny</B>: <font color='#000080'>I assume she knows she's entitled to a horse...</font><br>
[Fri Feb 13 18:55:02 2004] : <B>(3) Jenny</B>: <font color='#000080'>so I think she'll go claim one and ride out there.</font><br>
[Fri Feb 13 18:55:06 2004] : <B>(1) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>Well, your new memories indicate that you'd expressed an interest in the local gang situation.</font><br>
[Fri Feb 13 18:55:16 2004] : <B>(1) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>There's a dossier waiting for you.</font><br>
[Fri Feb 13 18:55:26 2004] : <B>(3) Jenny</B>: <font color='#000080'>Aha. Better read through it first.</font><br>
[Fri Feb 13 18:55:35 2004] : <B>(3) Jenny</B>: <font color='#000080'>Can she ask for more dossiers to land on her desk while she's gone?</font><br>
[Fri Feb 13 18:55:46 2004] : <B>(1) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>There are four major gangs operating in Ilium: the Toy Soldiers, the Black Sheep, the Cosmic Arrows, and the curiously-named Ultra Box.</font><br>
[Fri Feb 13 18:55:52 2004] : <B>(1) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>Sure, just name a topic.</font><br>
[Fri Feb 13 18:56:05 2004] : <B>(3) Jenny</B>: <font color='#000080'>Thieves' Guild -- summary and latest developments only, please.</font><br>
[Fri Feb 13 18:56:19 2004] : <B>(3) Jenny</B>: <font color='#000080'>And whatever branches of the Reichert family tree they've managed to dig up.</font><br>
[Fri Feb 13 18:56:56 2004] : <B>(1) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>The Toy Soldiers you already know about from your new memories. It turns out that with their control of the barely-regulated fishing piers of the Docklands, they have a hand in most smuggling.</font><br>
[Fri Feb 13 18:57:27 2004] : <B>(1) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>This means that they act as drug and arms wholesalers to Ilium, because most contraband that comes into the city comes by boat.</font><br>
[Fri Feb 13 18:57:36 2004] : <B>(3) Jenny</B>: <font color='#000080'>(Well, that would explain the Glitter talk, except Jenny doesn't remember it because she hasn't talked to Aryk...)</font><br>
[Fri Feb 13 18:58:10 2004] : <B>(3) Jenny</B>: <font color='#000080'>Explains why they had the wherewithal to blow the bridge.</font><br>
[Fri Feb 13 18:58:14 2004] : <B>(1) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>By "arms" I mean magic, especially illicit glyphs -- by law, only non-weapon glyphs can be made available without the strictest of military clearance.</font><br>
[Fri Feb 13 18:58:24 2004] : <B>(1) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>Same goes for rare potions and certain spell components.</font><br>
[Fri Feb 13 18:59:09 2004] : <B>(1) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>A "glyph" is a small magical item, resembling a worry stone, that can be "broken" (its magic released, turning it into a normal rock) to produce a spell effect.</font><br>
[Fri Feb 13 18:59:43 2004] : <B>(1) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>I haven't talked about them much, but they're on the level of household equipment. Cantrip glyphs are pretty common -- instead of buying Drano, you might break a glyph.</font><br>
[Fri Feb 13 18:59:59 2004] : <B>(3) Jenny</B>: <font color='#000080'>Right.</font><br>
[Fri Feb 13 19:00:44 2004] : <B>(1) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>Military glyphs are much more rare, to the point where Dark Eternal finds it easier to unlock Heaven's innate magical talents than to give them glyphs.</font><br>
[Fri Feb 13 19:01:12 2004] : <B>(3) Jenny</B>: <font color='#000080'>How are glyphs manufactured?</font><br>
[Fri Feb 13 19:01:25 2004] : <B>(1) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>In Ilium, only the most elite squad, the Mage Knights, uses glyphs. Jenny won't remember this, but you might recall that the Toy Soldiers thought Rien was a Mage Knight.</font><br>
[Fri Feb 13 19:01:40 2004] : <B>(1) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>They're created by the Artificer's Guild.</font><br>
[Fri Feb 13 19:01:40 2004] : <B>(2) Aryk</B>: <font color='#000080'>Yeah</font><br>
[Fri Feb 13 19:01:58 2004] : <B>(1) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>Black-market glyphs are produced by rogue Artificers, or stolen from Artificer stores by insiders.</font><br>
[Fri Feb 13 19:02:22 2004] : <B>(3) Jenny</B>: <font color='#000080'>Do glyphs register on magic-detection?</font><br>
[Fri Feb 13 19:02:44 2004] : <B>(1) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>Yes, they count as magical items of a level equal to their embedded spell.</font><br>
[Fri Feb 13 19:03:08 2004] : <B>(1) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>The glyphs effects are always, in the D&D parlance, "spell-like."</font><br>
[Fri Feb 13 19:03:10 2004] : <B>(3) Jenny</B>: <font color='#000080'>Gotcha. Um, how do you warehouse illegal ones, then?</font><br>
[Fri Feb 13 19:03:21 2004] : <B>(1) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>Lead box. Duh.</font><br>
[Fri Feb 13 19:03:22 2004] : <B>(1) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>:)</font><br>
[Fri Feb 13 19:03:31 2004] : <B>(3) Jenny</B>: <font color='#000080'>If you say so.</font><br>
[Fri Feb 13 19:03:59 2004] : <B>(1) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>I came up with the lead-box thing as a spot ruling long ago, but it's got precedent now.</font><br>
[Fri Feb 13 19:04:06 2004] : <B>(3) Jenny</B>: <font color='#000080'>heh</font><br>
[Fri Feb 13 19:04:30 2004] : <B>(1) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>A quarter-inch of lead is enough to block the basic mystical aura of an item.</font><br>
[Fri Feb 13 19:04:58 2004] : <B>(3) Jenny</B>: <font color='#000080'>Hate to think how heavy a lead-lined warehouse would be...</font><br>
[Fri Feb 13 19:05:02 2004] : <B>(1) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>I don't think it'll ever really come up, which is part of the reason I never even thought to mention it.</font><br>
[Fri Feb 13 19:05:11 2004] : <B>(2) Aryk</B>: <font color='#000080'>(And that way Kryptonians can't see them either.)</font><br>
[Fri Feb 13 19:05:18 2004] : <B>(3) Jenny</B>: <font color='#000080'>(HA!)</font><br>
[Fri Feb 13 19:05:47 2004] : <B>(1) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>Anyway, the Toy Soldiers handle smuggling, wholesale drug and arms dealing, and "protection," which includes both racketeering and actual security.</font><br>
[Fri Feb 13 19:06:04 2004] : <B>(1) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>They also provide "essential infrastructure" to the Docklands, such as that "road" you traveled.</font><br>
[Fri Feb 13 19:06:30 2004] : <B>(3) Jenny</B>: <font color='#000080'>And "the boss" just accepts this arrangement, does he?</font><br>
[Fri Feb 13 19:07:16 2004] : <B>(1) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>The dossier doesn't go into that, but as part of your political training back home, you were told that Noble Mercury has arrangements with the criminal elements of his city.</font><br>
[Fri Feb 13 19:07:51 2004] : <B>(1) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>They know he can destroy them, so they make deep concessions; he knows that something worse would spring up in their place if he did, so he lets them exist under his thumb.</font><br>
[Fri Feb 13 19:07:51 2004] : <B>(3) Jenny</B>: <font color='#000080'>Ugh. Jenny is very uncomfortable with that.</font><br>
[Fri Feb 13 19:08:15 2004] : <B>(1) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>She would be, of course. Noble Mercury is pragmatic to the point of evil&#8212;but what dragon is not?</font><br>
[Fri Feb 13 19:08:33 2004] : <B>(3) Jenny</B>: <font color='#000080'>Indeed.</font><br>
[Fri Feb 13 19:08:43 2004] : <B>(1) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>Jenny doesn't have much to compare it to.</font><br>
[Fri Feb 13 19:08:44 2004] : <B>(3) Jenny</B>: <font color='#000080'>Not that it takes a dragon.</font><br>
[Fri Feb 13 19:09:13 2004] : <B>(3) Jenny</B>: <font color='#000080'>Plenty of people with that kind of pragmatism.</font><br>
[Fri Feb 13 19:09:14 2004] : <B>(1) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>But Ilium has relatively few murders, rapes, and so forth. The gangs "keep it to a dull roar," violence-wise, as part of the deal.</font><br>
[Fri Feb 13 19:09:17 2004] : <B>(2) Aryk</B>: <font color='#000080'>(They're not evil, just misunderstood.)</font><br>
[Fri Feb 13 19:09:45 2004] : <B>(1) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>Dark Eternal has a similar grip on the crime situation in Andragar, although he doesn't deal as directly with the criminals.</font><br>
