Once we managed to get inside by the more violent means, since they had not the patience necessary for someone to get out of bed and answer the door, we spoke with several vampires including the Earl of Markwith.  We found out that Raven lied about his available powers in a very major way.  He can assume the forms of a raven, a panther and a mist that we know of.  He can resist sunlight, has powers of hypnotism and shadow weaving and blood magic."</font><br>

[Fri May 06 18:45:03 2005] : <B>Aryk</B>: <font color='#000080'>"More or less. I don't know if that's because we started directing the questions at him, or what."</font><br>
