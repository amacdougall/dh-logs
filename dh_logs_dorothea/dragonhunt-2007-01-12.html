[Fri Jan 12 19:24:01 2007] : <B>(3) Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>I think there's a HINT happening there, Matt, hon.</font><br>

[Fri Jan 12 19:26:01 2007] : <B>(2) Alan</B>: <font color='#000000'>Okay, so I scoured my notes for The Plot, and I apparently never got around to one.</font><br>

[Fri Jan 12 19:33:57 2007] : <B>(2) Alan</B>: <font color='#000000'>"I not hope for something as simple as identification papers," Adam sighs, "but these men came in clean. The casters don't even have spellbooks."</font><br>

[Fri Jan 12 19:35:23 2007] : <B>(2) Alan</B>: <font color='#000000'>"The librarian left conveniently. Possibly he was bribed. Questioning him might be a start. But I think we should involve the royal guard at this point."</font><br>

Heh.  I'm usually more surprised when I meet people who don't want to paint their house with my brain matter."</font><br>

[Fri Jan 12 19:44:50 2007] : <B>(2) Alan</B>: <font color='#000000'>Adam says, "Is she addressing him in court or in a private reception? Either way, we can't just go up and knock."</font><br>
[Fri Jan 12 19:45:19 2007] : <B>(5) Aryk</B>: <font color='#a40000'>"Privately, probably.  Whatcha got in mind, T?"</font><br>
[Fri Jan 12 19:47:20 2007] : <B>(2) Alan</B>: <font color='#000000'>"My own orders are simply to disrupt this plot, and then follow my instincts until extraction. And my instincts are, as ever, conservative."</font><br>
[Fri Jan 12 19:48:43 2007] : <B>(2) Alan</B>: <font color='#000000'>"It is not even certain that Adam was directly targeted by this attack. The books were on a time trigger. Adam, the librarian asked you to come here at a specific time, did he not?"</font><br>
[Fri Jan 12 19:48:57 2007] : <B>(2) Alan</B>: <font color='#000000'>Adam nods. "I planned my day around being killed, apparently."</font><br>
[Fri Jan 12 19:49:08 2007] : <B>(2) Alan</B>: <font color='#000000'>"Would that we all had the luxury."</font><br>
[Fri Jan 12 19:50:26 2007] : <B>(5) Aryk</B>: <font color='#a40000'>"Well, then... Templeton, I say until further notice you can conservatively tag along with Adam and me.  And what we three are gonna do is find some way to thwart the Shadow-Watcher before he can get back on his feet, and in the meantime Rennie is doing her best to talk the King out of the foolishness.</font><br>
[Fri Jan 12 19:50:30 2007] : <B>(2) Alan</B>: <font color='#000000'>Templeton is removing his black decoy armor; it doesn't fit well to begin with. Underneath it, he is wearing quilted clothing that is a fair match for what Aryk has seen stable servants wearing.</font><br>
[Fri Jan 12 19:51:02 2007] : <B>(2) Alan</B>: <font color='#000000'>"I find myself without much excuse to carry an axe around the palace," Templeton says regretfully.</font><br>

[Fri Jan 12 19:52:55 2007] : <B>(2) Alan</B>: <font color='#000000'>"With this? Unlikely at best. Maybe a disguise." Templeton pulls down some wall hanging and does his best to bundle the axe up in them.</font><br>

[Fri Jan 12 20:00:28 2007] : <B>(5) Aryk</B>: <font color='#a40000'>"That works," Aryk agrees.</font><br>
[Fri Jan 12 20:01:44 2007] : <B>(2) Alan</B>: <font color='#000000'>Adam leads you through the palace; Aryk is starting to get a general sense of direction, and realizes that you are on the second floor, heading toward the central wing.</font><br>
[Fri Jan 12 20:02:55 2007] : <B>(2) Alan</B>: <font color='#000000'>The palace guard presence grows thicker as you go, and finally Adam stops before a door that is flanked by royal guards (an order of actual knights, distinct from the ceremonial soldiers of the palace guard).</font><br>

[Fri Jan 12 20:05:42 2007] : <B>(2) Alan</B>: <font color='#000000'>The guard says, "I've forgotten the ritual, brother. You are welcome to enter."</font><br>

They are valid; more, they are just. But your requested compensation is not equitable. Instead, let it be so done: you shall receive two-thirds of the lands north of the river, and in lieu of the remainder, Jiuoka-san will provide you a rent of two gold pieces each year. If the land is as fertile as he protests, he will be able to earn that and more from it."</font><br>

[Fri Jan 12 20:11:15 2007] : <B>(2) Alan</B>: <font color='#000000'>There are three ringing claps of wood on stone, and a murmur from the onlookers.</font><br>
[Fri Jan 12 20:12:29 2007] : <B>(2) Alan</B>: <font color='#000000'>The observation gallery is filled with courtiers and interested citizens; though not all seem noble, all do seem rich or well connected. They stand at the railing looking down; only a few have sufficient status to lounge in chairs without their view being obstructed by someone more curious.</font><br>
[Fri Jan 12 20:12:55 2007] : <B>(2) Alan</B>: <font color='#000000'>Palace guards are stationed throughout, with one royal guard commanding a raised platform just in case.</font><br>
[Fri Jan 12 20:13:13 2007] : <font color='#008000'>** (5) Aryk gets to the front of the balcony and gets a better look. **</font><br>

[Fri Jan 12 20:15:21 2007] : <B>(5) Aryk</B>: <font color='#a40000'>"Yeah," he says, gawking.</font><br>
[Fri Jan 12 20:15:41 2007] : <B>(2) Alan</B>: <font color='#000000'>The great hall is as wide and ornate as the inside of a cathedral; internal buttresses arch from the walls to the ceiling above you.

[Fri Jan 12 20:17:20 2007] : <B>(2) Alan</B>: <font color='#000000'>The king stands on a dais at the north end of the hall; he sits on a simple heavy wooden chair. The wreckage of an ornate throne is scattered around him.</font><br>
[Fri Jan 12 20:18:28 2007] : <B>(2) Alan</B>: <font color='#000000'>"The old throne was a gift from the merchant guilds to his great-great-grandfather after the one before <i>that</i> was burned in some sort of uprising," Adam explains.</font><br>

[Fri Jan 12 20:20:32 2007] : <B>(2) Alan</B>: <font color='#000000'>The king's dais is bracketed by royal guards; but around them is a cadre of young hobgoblins in equally fine but mismatched armor, each carrying his own preferred weapon&#8212;rapiers, longswords, axes.</font><br>
[Fri Jan 12 20:20:53 2007] : <B>(2) Alan</B>: <font color='#000000'>The only thing uniting this secondary guard is their identical blue berets.</font><br>
[Fri Jan 12 20:21:35 2007] : <B>(5) Aryk</B>: <font color='#a40000'>"A volunteer guard, eh?"</font><br>
[Fri Jan 12 20:21:37 2007] : <B>(2) Alan</B>: <font color='#000000'>"Looks like he's rewarded the Bluebloods," Adam comments. "Makes sense. They were only defending their own noble privileges, but it meant they also supported the king."</font><br>
[Fri Jan 12 20:21:53 2007] : <font color='#008000'>** (5) Aryk nods. **</font><br>
[Fri Jan 12 20:22:08 2007] : <B>(2) Alan</B>: <font color='#000000'>"The Bluebloods thought they were defending the nobility against the commoner merchants, but intentions don't always cheapen actions."</font><br>

[Fri Jan 12 20:23:59 2007] : <B>(2) Alan</B>: <font color='#000000'>At the southern end of the hall, a withered old hobgoblin raps his metal-shod staff against the ground three times again, and the room grows silent. With occasional pauses for breath, he hoarsely rattles off a string of hobgoblin that Aryk can't quite catch, ending with a perfect pronunciation of 'Renate Harzig.'"</font><br>
[Fri Jan 12 20:24:49 2007] : <B>(5) Aryk</B>: <font color='#a40000'>"Ooh, hey!  Here she comes!" Aryk whispers.</font><br>
[Fri Jan 12 20:24:57 2007] : <B>(2) Alan</B>: <font color='#000000'>Adam whispers to Aryk, "Interesting... they're going to execute her right in front of everyone. Do you think her hobgoblin's good enough to know what they're talking about?"</font><br>

[Fri Jan 12 20:27:22 2007] : <font color='#008000'>** (3) Renate enters between a pair of hobgoblin guards who tower over her. **</font><br>
[Fri Jan 12 20:28:15 2007] : <B>(3) Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>Her self-possession is absolute; if she <em>had</em> been walking to her own execution, not a hair on her head would be different.</font><br>
[Fri Jan 12 20:29:14 2007] : <font color='#008000'>** (5) Aryk waves. **</font><br>
[Fri Jan 12 20:30:15 2007] : <B>(3) Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>With perfect dignity, she does as instructed by the protocol guardian earlier: she walks the length of the hall with stately tread, her cane steering her past random pieces of the shattered throne, and kneels gracefully at King Sesshu Takemura's feet, awaiting his acknowledgment.</font><br>
[Fri Jan 12 20:33:00 2007] : <B>(3) Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>(I don't think Templeton would let them off Renate without a fight.)</font><br>

[Fri Jan 12 20:34:16 2007] : <B>(2) Alan</B>: <font color='#000000'>"Rise, Renate Harzig," the king says in accented but competent Trade Tongue.</font><br>
[Fri Jan 12 20:34:56 2007] : <B>(3) Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>She does, as gracefully as she had knelt.</font><br>
[Fri Jan 12 20:37:48 2007] : <B>(2) Alan</B>: <font color='#000000'>The king places his hands on his knees and leans forward in his chair. The simply-made wood creaks. "Let it be known that, in a time when the way before me was under water, and the air around me was thick, and all voices came to me as though in a heavy fog, clear but without source or direction, you provided me with counsel that was both wise and decisive."</font><br>
[Fri Jan 12 20:38:30 2007] : <B>(2) Alan</B>: <font color='#000000'>"Let it be written that Renate Harzig did great service to the throne."</font><br>
[Fri Jan 12 20:41:15 2007] : <B>(2) Alan</B>: <font color='#000000'>"You walk a way all your own. I have been told this by everyone I have asked. Money, land, power; you would appreciate the thought behind these things. You might even accept them, if only to pass them on to those you think more deserving. But they would not address your true wants."</font><br>
[Fri Jan 12 20:41:42 2007] : <B>(2) Alan</B>: <font color='#000000'>"In fact, nobody I asked could say, with any certainty, what your wants are."</font><br>
[Fri Jan 12 20:42:10 2007] : <B>(2) Alan</B>: <font color='#000000'>"So I ask you before this throne, Renate Harzig, what this throne can do for you."</font><br>
[Fri Jan 12 20:42:43 2007] : <B>(3) Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>Renate does not speak for some time, long enough for the blue-capped guards to grow restive.</font><br>
[Fri Jan 12 20:43:50 2007] : <B>(3) Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>"Your Majesty's generosity warms his hearth in defiance of the harshest winter winds," she says at last, letting her voice carry.</font><br>
[Fri Jan 12 20:44:58 2007] : <B>(3) Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>"Yet as the greater part of my counsel did not find favor in Your Majesty's sight, I hardly see how I dare ask recompense for it."</font><br>
[Fri Jan 12 20:47:42 2007] : <B>(3) Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>"I sought to advise a king to walk with his people in the light of pure truth. Yet those people are not here, and I dare not say what hidden truths this room may hold."</font><br>
[Fri Jan 12 20:48:45 2007] : <B>(2) Alan</B>: <font color='#000000'>"To change, you told me, one must let himself <i>be</i> changed," the king replies.</font><br>
[Fri Jan 12 20:49:44 2007] : <B>(2) Alan</B>: <font color='#000000'>"And yet this court is unchanged. With minor exceptions, its people are no different. Some have been restored to power, some have fallen. Where are 'the people'? This question is valid."</font><br>
[Fri Jan 12 20:50:41 2007] : <B>(2) Alan</B>: <font color='#000000'>"To some extent, I can claim the defense of... is the word 'exigency?'"</font><br>
[Fri Jan 12 20:50:53 2007] : <font color='#008000'>** (3) Renate bows her head in assent. **</font><br>
[Fri Jan 12 20:51:19 2007] : <B>(2) Alan</B>: <font color='#000000'>"But I cannot hold that to be the whole of my policy. A slave to circumstance is a slave."</font><br>
[Fri Jan 12 20:52:33 2007] : <B>(2) Alan</B>: <font color='#000000'>The king rises from his chair and descends the steps to Renate. "I am told you can see through the eyes of those around you. I wish to the heavens that I could do the same. My duties would be far more simple."</font><br>
[Fri Jan 12 20:52:42 2007] : <B>(2) Alan</B>: <font color='#000000'>A dutiful chuckle runs through the court.</font><br>
[Fri Jan 12 20:53:08 2007] : <B>(3) Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>"I would wish my blindness on no one, Majesty; certainly not your gracious self."</font><br>
[Fri Jan 12 20:53:44 2007] : <B>(2) Alan</B>: <font color='#000000'>"So look upon that chair, on its raised platform. It affords a fine view of its surroundings, does it not? But who would want to look on this?" He encompasses the court with a sweeping gesture.</font><br>
[Fri Jan 12 20:54:06 2007] : <B>(2) Alan</B>: <font color='#000000'>"The mountain goatherd has a finer view by far; he sees further and clearer."</font><br>
[Fri Jan 12 20:55:08 2007] : <B>(2) Alan</B>: <font color='#000000'>"This court is a purgatory. We all toil here; even those who seek to catch my ear and whisper casual suggestions are like quarry workers, sweating out days from sunup to sundown."</font><br>
[Fri Jan 12 20:56:03 2007] : <B>(2) Alan</B>: <font color='#000000'>"Perhaps I take too long to get to the point," the king says. "These proceedings instill a habit of rhetoric."</font><br>
[Fri Jan 12 20:56:48 2007] : <B>(3) Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>"I listen, Majesty, to whatever wisdom you are pleased to impart."</font><br>
[Fri Jan 12 20:59:11 2007] : <B>(2) Alan</B>: <font color='#000000'>He sits on one of the steps of the dais, at eye level with Renate. "Simply put, then: these people are nobles of the old guard, or else they strive to be; or else they will be <i>made</i> to be; or else they will cease to be. Nobles whose lives are tied to their homeland, more, to the very dirt and stone and wood their subjects live on. There is a tradition there that must not be swept away."</font><br>
[Fri Jan 12 21:00:01 2007] : <B>(2) Alan</B>: <font color='#000000'>"After over a century of rule by profit and secret council, at last these nobles may regain the ability to speak for their people, and bring food and money back to their people."</font><br>
[Fri Jan 12 21:01:50 2007] : <B>(3) Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>"A question, Majesty, if I may. How will you know if these nobles follow the path you set, if the very folk they are meant to serve are forbidden the light of your presence? I am only an outsider, a guest on sufferance, an outcast from my own lands -- but my heart bids me speak for them, for there is none else here to!"</font><br>
[Fri Jan 12 21:02:45 2007] : <B>(2) Alan</B>: <font color='#000000'>The court murmurs disapproval, but the king raises a hand to silence them.</font><br>
[Fri Jan 12 21:02:57 2007] : <B>(3) Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>"If you will not hear them now, Majesty, then when? And if not here, where? They are sent away, Majesty, and all you have done since this change came upon you is overawe them!"</font><br>
[Fri Jan 12 21:03:22 2007] : <B>(3) Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>She faces the court defiantly. "If I speak blasphemy, so be it -- to <em>you</em> I am not beholden!"</font><br>
[Fri Jan 12 21:04:09 2007] : <B>(2) Alan</B>: <font color='#000000'>The king stands, looking up at the east wall, where the light from the west casts a stained-glass image of a flaming sword.</font><br>

[Fri Jan 12 21:05:23 2007] : <B>(2) Alan</B>: <font color='#000000'>"I see an Eastlands lion, lazy at the center of his pride. His lionesses hunt for him. His children play around him."</font><br>
[Fri Jan 12 21:06:20 2007] : <B>(2) Alan</B>: <font color='#000000'>"I see a manticore come upon them, stinging with its tail; now the lion rises and does battle."</font><br>
[Fri Jan 12 21:06:39 2007] : <B>(2) Alan</B>: <font color='#000000'>"But the lion fights alone, and is killed. I see his lionesses and his cubs bow to the manticore."</font><br>
[Fri Jan 12 21:08:13 2007] : <B>(2) Alan</B>: <font color='#000000'>"This vision assures me that you are correct. I thought that submerging myself in affairs of state would put my house in order, but it may be that I have only allowed its foundation to decay further."</font><br>
[Fri Jan 12 21:08:14 2007] : <B>(5) Aryk</B>: <font color='#a40000'>"What's a manticore?" Aryk whispers to Adam.</font><br>
[Fri Jan 12 21:08:33 2007] : <B>(2) Alan</B>: <font color='#000000'>"Some sort of ancient monster. Extinct," Adam whispers back.</font><br>
[Fri Jan 12 21:11:09 2007] : <B>(2) Alan</B>: <font color='#000000'>The king says, "War still divides this land. I go tomorrow to ride among the fronts and review the men. How say you if I go among the farmers and hunters as well, absent their rulers, and ask after their fortunes?"</font><br>
[Fri Jan 12 21:11:50 2007] : <B>(3) Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>"I am answered, Majesty, and well answered; may it prosper you as you deserve."</font><br>
[Fri Jan 12 21:12:05 2007] : <B>(2) Alan</B>: <font color='#000000'>"The ways of Sunese kings have always been distant. Your southern traditions are strangely close for our wintry eyes."</font><br>
[Fri Jan 12 21:14:14 2007] : <B>(2) Alan</B>: <font color='#000000'>"I invite you, but do not require you, to come with me. See if I absorb this custom well.

[Fri Jan 12 21:14:48 2007] : <B>(3) Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>"I will come, and gladly; and I <em>shall</em> make bold to beg a boon, if Your Majesty will hear me."</font><br>
[Fri Jan 12 21:16:19 2007] : <B>(2) Alan</B>: <font color='#000000'>He stands again, and walks close to Renate. In a low voice, he says, "I have had another vision, every night; a barbaric hobgoblin with a sword chipped of flint is surrounded by black wolves. Though his rough blade bursts into flame as he fights, he is taken down nip by nip. There are few I have strong reason to trust."</font><br>
[Fri Jan 12 21:16:29 2007] : <B>(2) Alan</B>: <font color='#000000'>(This is all pitched not to carry.)</font><br>
