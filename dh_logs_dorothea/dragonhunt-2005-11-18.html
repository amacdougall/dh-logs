[Fri Nov 18 19:07:57 2005] : <B>(1) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>As they approach the jungle, the Zero Knights fan out and establish a formation with machete-wielding trailbreakers in the fore, closely followed by pikemen and crossbowmen ready to defend them; double-file squads of swordsmen and axemen behind, to travel down the cleared brush; and mounted knights in five squads.</font><br>
[Fri Nov 18 19:09:12 2005] : <B>(1) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>The outermost squads of knights ride large lizards, which climb up into the trees and leap from trunk to trunk; the remaining three ride beasts somewhere between horses and rams, which surefootedly step, crash, or jump through the forest.</font><br>

[Fri Nov 18 19:16:10 2005] : <B>(1) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>The tornado gradually loses power as it rips through the jungle, and the swath of devastation grows less and less severe; but it is at this point that the army encounters something evidently unexpected.</font><br>

[Fri Nov 18 20:47:45 2005] : <B>(1) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>The pit is wide and open; there's a tent down inside it, with some furniture inside.</font><br>
[Fri Nov 18 20:48:06 2005] : <B>(1) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>"Okay, okay, hold on..." he goes inside the tent, which seems to be mounted on some sort of metal plate.</font><br>
