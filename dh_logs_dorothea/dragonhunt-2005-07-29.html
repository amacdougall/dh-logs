For those who haven't heard OpenRPG 1.6.1 has been released.  You can get it by typing <i>/update get</i> in the chat window.  If that doesn't work you can go to the www.openrpg.com get openrpg page <a href="http://www.openrpg.com/index.php?page=install">http://www.openrpg.com/index.php?page=install</a> and download the zip file and unzip it over your current version (make a backup of your stuff just incase of a catastrophy).

Also mDuo has released a patch for 1.6.1 to allow plugins.  You can download that at <a href="http://mduo13.no-ip.org">http://mduo13.no-ip.org</a>

[Fri Jul 29 22:32:52 2005] : <B>(571) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>"The politics of guilds are distinct from the politics of nations. We would remain; and in the unlikely event of a wholly Andragarian Northrock, we would be valued for our abilities."</font><br>
