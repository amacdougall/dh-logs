[Fri May 21 20:25:29 2010] : <b>(7801) Alan</b>: <font color='#00008c'>Assuming you know how to drive now.</font><br />

[Fri May 21 20:25:49 2010] : <b>(7803) Renate</b>: <font color='#000080'>Hey, I got my new no-longer-probationary license today!</font><br />

[Fri May 21 20:26:07 2010] : <b>(7802) Rien</b>: <font color='#263607'>Still learning.  I know the principles of everything now, so it's all just practice.</font><br />
[Fri May 21 20:26:17 2010] : <b>(7801) Alan</b>: <font color='#00008c'>Wait, Adrian's about to take a test, and Dorothea just got a real license. Got it.</font><br />
[Fri May 21 20:26:21 2010] : <b>(7803) Renate</b>: <font color='#000080'>Yep. :)</font><br />
[Fri May 21 20:26:45 2010] : <b>(7802) Rien</b>: <font color='#263607'>I should be taking my practice test in two, maybe three weeks, then my actual test about five or six weeks after that.</font><br />

[Fri May 21 20:27:47 2010] : <b>(7801) Alan</b>: <font color='#00008c'>Well, how long have we got? We can cover a little ground at least.</font><br />
[Fri May 21 20:28:00 2010] : <b>(7802) Rien</b>: <font color='#263607'>Hour and a little bit.</font><br />
[Fri May 21 20:28:31 2010] : <b>(7803) Renate</b>: <font color='#000080'>'k, bring it on!</font><br />
[Fri May 21 20:28:36 2010] : <b>(7801) Alan</b>: <font color='#00008c'>Yep.</font><br />
[Fri May 21 20:29:48 2010] : <b>(7801) Alan</b>: <font color='#00008c'>"Ohp, here we go... best shade your eyes, it's almost noon," Rolls says, bending over to pick up a big floppy straw hat. The sun is just a distant glimmer up in the shifting leaves of the upper canopy.</font><br />
[Fri May 21 20:30:12 2010] : <font color='#008000'>** (7803) Renate <font color='#008000'>raises a quizzical eyebrow.</font> **</font><br />
[Fri May 21 20:31:14 2010] : <b>(7801) Alan</b>: <font color='#00008c'>Billy the Cutter says, "Good thing we ain't made much more than a nick in this one..." and goes to stand on the lee of the tree trunk. "Don't worry, it ain't gonna hurt you. Just gonna be mighty bright."</font><br />
[Fri May 21 20:32:12 2010] : <b>(7801) Alan</b>: <font color='#00008c'>The sun does seem to be getting brighter; instead of a white gold glow up somewhere beyond the leaves, it's more of a distant glare, and taking on a faint green tinge.</font><br />
[Fri May 21 20:32:17 2010] : <b>(7802) Rien</b>: <font color='#263607'>Rien echoes Renate's gesture, but does step back.</font><br />
[Fri May 21 20:33:26 2010] : <b>(7801) Alan</b>: <font color='#00008c'>The sunlight begins to pierce through the leaves, and every tree in the forest grows a stark shadow; the light that filters through the leaves is green as well, but at least it comes by the tint honestly.</font><br />
[Fri May 21 20:33:53 2010] : <b>(7801) Alan</b>: <font color='#00008c'>The green light feels hot upon your brow unless you take shelter in a shadow or under a hat or cowl.</font><br />
[Fri May 21 20:35:16 2010] : <b>(7802) Rien</b>: <font color='#263607'>Rien takes his cue from the people who actually live there, taking shelter from the light, taking Renate, Aryk and Emily with him.</font><br />
[Fri May 21 20:35:19 2010] : <b>(7801) Alan</b>: <font color='#00008c'>And although the brightness increases gradually, there is a sudden shift in Rien's perception of it, just like the shift when a moving shadow gives way to light and stabs your eye in the course of an instant -- no longer the natural sunlight of this plane, this light is coming from somewhere else.</font><br />
[Fri May 21 20:35:57 2010] : <b>(7801) Alan</b>: <font color='#00008c'>"Okay, so this just officially got weird," Aryk says. "Is that really Chaos light, Rien?" It most definitely is...</font><br />
[Fri May 21 20:36:49 2010] : <b>(7801) Alan</b>: <font color='#00008c'>This light is coming from the raw potential of the Chaos Plane.</font><br />
[Fri May 21 20:36:51 2010] : <b>(7803) Renate</b>: <font color='#000080'>"So... have we changed location?" Renate hazards.</font><br />
[Fri May 21 20:36:59 2010] : <b>(7802) Rien</b>: <font color='#263607'>"It really, really is," Rien murmurs as he observes the effects the light is having.</font><br />
[Fri May 21 20:37:45 2010] : <b>(7801) Alan</b>: <font color='#00008c'>The best guess Rien can make is that somewhere between the sun and the upper atmosphere, a portal to the Chaos Plane has opened up, allowing some source of extremely bright light to shine over Birch Creek.</font><br />
[Fri May 21 20:38:26 2010] : <b>(7801) Alan</b>: <font color='#00008c'>Rien's grip on life magic and biology is not strong enough to tell exactly what's happening, but the light appears to be energizing the plants it touches.</font><br />
[Fri May 21 20:39:05 2010] : <b>(7802) Rien</b>: <font color='#263607'>Rien makes a note to ask around Margolin and find out if there was a very bright light shortly before the land became fertile again.</font><br />
[Fri May 21 20:39:39 2010] : <b>(7801) Alan</b>: <font color='#00008c'>"Does this at noon sharp every day," Rolls says -- despite the light show, the forest is a bit quieter than before. Maybe the singing birds have taken shelter from the light as well.</font><br />
[Fri May 21 20:39:59 2010] : <b>(7803) Renate</b>: <font color='#000080'>Renate's mind is running along similar lines. "So... whatever that is, it's... generative? Is that the word?"</font><br />
[Fri May 21 20:40:45 2010] : <b>(7801) Alan</b>: <font color='#00008c'>"Pretty sure the light speeds up the crops, yeah," Rolls says. "That's why we don't have to put in much effort. That, and weeds politely don't grow in our patches."</font><br />
[Fri May 21 20:41:31 2010] : <b>(7803) Renate</b>: <font color='#000080'>"Interesting. So it's selective. Who does the selecting, I wonder? Is it even a conscious choice?"</font><br />
[Fri May 21 20:41:38 2010] : <b>(7803) Renate</b>: <font color='#000080'>"Or does it key off us somehow?"</font><br />
[Fri May 21 20:41:42 2010] : <b>(7801) Alan</b>: <font color='#00008c'>The light begins to wane; the Chaos Light cuts off, exactly like the sun moving behind a mountain, though the visible light wanes smoothly.</font><br />
[Fri May 21 20:42:50 2010] : <b>(7801) Alan</b>: <font color='#00008c'>Either the portal is closing gradually, causing a moving boundary between Chaos and normal light, or the portal opens onto a moving light source which only aligns with Birch Creek at noon.</font><br />
[Fri May 21 20:43:24 2010] : <b>(7802) Rien</b>: <font color='#263607'>"It seems to be feeding the land.  And it gets around the Accords by not opening a portal direct to Chaos and allowing the raw matter through into the prime material plane.  We're not there.  Fascinating."</font><br />
[Fri May 21 20:43:29 2010] : <b>(7801) Alan</b>: <font color='#00008c'>Rien can't get any sense of the portal, even though it must be huge; that means either it is very far away, or it is not created by magic.</font><br />
[Fri May 21 20:44:12 2010] : <b>(7801) Alan</b>: <font color='#00008c'>I'm referring to this pocket plane as Birch Creek, and the unpopulated forest in the Human World as Herrendon Deep.</font><br />
[Fri May 21 20:44:22 2010] : <b>(7803) Renate</b>: <font color='#000080'>"Well, if it's an Accord, doesn't it only bind dragons and mortals?" Renate asks. "You can't bind a Chaos being with an Accord. Absalom would just laugh, or whatever he does."</font><br />
[Fri May 21 20:44:46 2010] : <b>(7801) Alan</b>: <font color='#00008c'>Since Birch Creek is separated from Herrendon Deep by only a small amount, perhaps the Grovekeeper can release energy subtly from Birch Creek into the human-world locale.</font><br />
[Fri May 21 20:44:57 2010] : <b>(7801) Alan</b>: <font color='#00008c'>Or purlieu, as Emily would say.</font><br />
[Fri May 21 20:46:29 2010] : <b>(7801) Alan</b>: <font color='#00008c'>"So, that's that, until midnight," Rolls says. "Midnight, it kind of works the other way around -- that's when you can go through to the rest of the world."</font><br />
[Fri May 21 20:46:52 2010] : <font color='#008000'>** (7803) Renate <font color='#008000'>closes her eyes for a moment in sheer relief.</font> **</font><br />
[Fri May 21 20:47:02 2010] : <b>(7802) Rien</b>: <font color='#263607'>"There are accords between this world and the chaos plane, to never allow the raw matter of the chaos plane to enter this world and do what it may."</font><br />
[Fri May 21 20:47:13 2010] : <b>(7801) Alan</b>: <font color='#00008c'>"Don't know why you'd want to, though," Billy the Cutter says. "Got a great thing going here."</font><br />
[Fri May 21 20:47:36 2010] : <b>(7801) Alan</b>: <font color='#00008c'>(Rien's right -- remember the trouble Leonid almost got himself into?)</font><br />
[Fri May 21 20:48:12 2010] : <b>(7802) Rien</b>: <font color='#263607'>(I'm still wondering how Rien gets around that, if his power opens up a channel to Chaos and uses its power like he did during the fight with Fantome.)</font><br />
