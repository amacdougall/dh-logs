[Fri Feb  5 21:44:51 2010] : <b>(3159) Renate</b>: <font color='#000080'>Only that he fought with other dragons, which is kind of par for the course, you know?</font><br />
[Fri Feb  5 21:45:20 2010] : <b>(3163) Alan</b>: <font color='#000080'>Yeah.</font><br />

[Fri Feb  5 21:46:10 2010] : <b>(3159) Renate</b>: <font color='#000080'>Gah, that would freak her right out. Just like Forengil.</font><br />
[Fri Feb  5 21:46:50 2010] : <b>(3163) Alan</b>: <font color='#000080'>I got the impression Renate thanked them for the offer, but did not accept it.</font><br />

[Fri Feb  5 21:48:22 2010] : <b>(3163) Alan</b>: <font color='#000080'>Oh, okay. In that case, Renate got an amazing three-dimensional percept of the shipyard area in all its starkly functional splendor.</font><br />

[Fri Feb  5 21:49:05 2010] : <b>(3159) Renate</b>: <font color='#000080'>he would have gotten the sense from her that she's completely burned out on wonder for a while</font><br />
[Fri Feb  5 21:49:21 2010] : <b>(3159) Renate</b>: <font color='#000080'>like me in the Habsburg jewelry museum in Vienna</font><br />
[Fri Feb  5 21:49:29 2010] : <b>(3163) Alan</b>: <font color='#000080'>The shipyard takes up about half the total volume of the ship.</font><br />

[Fri Feb  5 21:50:01 2010] : <b>(3163) Alan</b>: <font color='#000080'>If you guys ask for a tour of the ship, you'll find (to Rien's astonishment and Renate's and Aryk's incomprehension) that it's powered by a cluster of seven micro black holes.</font><br />

[Fri Feb  5 21:51:44 2010] : <b>(3163) Alan</b>: <font color='#000080'>At the NYPL, they have a tome on display that's billed as a Gutenberg Bible. Or one of its two volumes, at least.</font><br />
[Fri Feb  5 21:51:57 2010] : <b>(3159) Renate</b>: <font color='#000080'>I believe they do have one, yes.</font><br />
[Fri Feb  5 21:52:25 2010] : <b>(3163) Alan</b>: <font color='#000080'>I know the NYPL does have a near-pristine Gutenberg Bible in its collection, but would they really have just one volume out in a display case? Isn't it light-sensitive or something?</font><br />
[Fri Feb  5 21:52:57 2010] : <b>(3163) Alan</b>: <font color='#000080'>This is something I could just ask one of the librarians on duty, I guess, but I would feel really awkward saying "so is that bible fake?"</font><br />
[Fri Feb  5 21:52:58 2010] : <b>(3159) Renate</b>: <font color='#000080'>If it's a properly-prepared display case, yeah.</font><br />
[Fri Feb  5 21:53:02 2010] : <b>(3159) Renate</b>: <font color='#000080'>But it may be a facsimile.</font><br />
[Fri Feb  5 21:53:26 2010] : <b>(3159) Renate</b>: <font color='#000080'>When I went to the Treasures Room in the British Library, they'd only just put the Book of Kells back on display after restoration work.</font><br />
[Fri Feb  5 21:53:36 2010] : <b>(3159) Renate</b>: <font color='#000080'>They had the facsimile they'd used in its place by the exit door.</font><br />
[Fri Feb  5 21:53:59 2010] : <b>(3166) Rien</b>: <font color='#400040'>It's mostly UV the books are sensitive to, isn't it?</font><br />
[Fri Feb  5 21:54:20 2010] : <b>(3166) Rien</b>: <font color='#400040'>If so, it's easily enough to make glass that blocks UV entirely and allows everything else through.</font><br />
[Fri Feb  5 21:54:27 2010] : <b>(3166) Rien</b>: <font color='#400040'>Silica glass already blocks infra-red.</font><br />
