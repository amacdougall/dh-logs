[Fri Apr 30 23:26:53 2004] : <B>(2) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>Old Wolf and the entire gang of Bounty Strike adventurers is galloping down the street, and up in the sky...</font><br>
[Fri Apr 30 23:26:58 2004] : <B>(7) Aryk</B>: <font color='#000080'>"Yeah.  We've done what we needed to do here.  We'll be heading back.</font><br>
[Fri Apr 30 23:27:36 2004] : <B>(2) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>Yes! Two dragons are circling for a landing! Noble Sapphire's gemlike blue is unmistakable even against the late-afternoon sun, and Noble Mercury's bronze with silver stripes is easy to make out.</font><br>
[Fri Apr 30 23:28:13 2004] : <font color='#008000'>** (1) Renate comes out the front door of the inn, curious. **</font><br>
[Fri Apr 30 23:28:30 2004] : <B>(2) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>"Looks like you'll have company, huh? I'm going to split. I can't have Garland knowing where I am. I've already told the villagers about my Anti-Anti-Paladin Quest, so they'll cover for me. Will you do the same?"</font><br>
[Fri Apr 30 23:28:47 2004] : <B>(2) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>"Remember, St. Konoe Mountain and you'll know sort of why you're helping me keep mum."</font><br>
[Fri Apr 30 23:28:53 2004] : <B>(2) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>"Old Wolf is right there, even."</font><br>
[Fri Apr 30 23:29:14 2004] : <B>(2) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>Emily flips over the rail of the porch after grabbing Renate and Aryk for an unexpected, brief, and awkward hug.</font><br>
[Fri Apr 30 23:29:24 2004] : <B>(2) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>In a moment (assuming nobody chases her) she's out of sight between buildings.</font><br>
[Fri Apr 30 23:29:48 2004] : <font color='#008000'>** (1) Renate hugs back as best she can; her best hugs have some deliberation behind them. **</font><br>
[Fri Apr 30 23:30:24 2004] : <B>(1) Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>Then she steps out into the road to greet the new arrivals, standing straight as a spear in spite of her dirty, torn clothing.</font><br>
[Fri Apr 30 23:31:14 2004] : <B>(2) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>Old Wolf dismounts and walks up, giving a formal salute in congratulations.</font><br>
[Fri Apr 30 23:31:22 2004] : <font color='#008000'>** (1) Renate bows. **</font><br>
[Fri Apr 30 23:31:28 2004] : <B>(2) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>"Truly excellent work, my lady," he exclaims.</font><br>
[Fri Apr 30 23:32:07 2004] : <B>(1) Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>"It was hardly I," she answers. "I have no words fit to describe the courage and faith of the men and women of Darrenfold."</font><br>
[Fri Apr 30 23:32:40 2004] : <B>(1) Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>"Truly a shame," she adds, raising her voice, "that they should have been endangered so pointlessly."</font><br>
[Fri Apr 30 23:33:09 2004] : <font color='#008000'>** (7) Aryk recovers from the hug and approaches the scene.  He bows, unable to keep his eyes off the dragons. **</font><br>
[Fri Apr 30 23:33:43 2004] : <B>(2) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>(hold on, phone)</font><br>
[Fri Apr 30 23:33:49 2004] : <B>(2) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>(Actually, this is a scene in itself...)</font><br>
