[Sat Apr 23 19:01:29 2011] : <b>(155) Alan</b>: <font color='#612769'>The flicker of divine power spears across the patio and settles like a shimmering cloud.</font><br />

[Sat Apr 23 19:03:06 2011] : <b>(155) Alan</b>: <font color='#612769'>Rien deduces two things from this: one, that the Aspect Knights are calling on their power exactly as a normal cleric would, but they're using the altar to make the effects more permanent; and two, that someone in the patio just got zapped.</font><br />
[Sat Apr 23 19:03:36 2011] : <b>(155) Alan</b>: <font color='#612769'>And three, by logic: nobody can detect him here in the Mirror Realm, at least passively, or he'd have been zapped too.</font><br />

[Sat Apr 23 21:03:08 2011] : <b>(158) Renate</b>: <font color='#000080'>"Right behind you. Let's not tarry."</font><br />
[Sat Apr 23 21:03:12 2011] : <b>(155) Alan</b>: <font color='#612769'>With his magical sight, Rien catches a glimpse, again, of a concentrated, almost skeletal divine essence, which cuts away into the distance.</font><br />
[Sat Apr 23 21:03:57 2011] : <b>(156) Rien</b>: <font color='#263607'>"Quickly now.  Let's move."</font><br />
[Sat Apr 23 21:05:24 2011] : <b>(155) Alan</b>: <font color='#612769'>With Adam's counfounding prayer keeping the one-time Chaos Lord blind to your location, this journey passes more safely than the last; Renate's danger sense does no more than prickle during the entire swift ride. (Reading the log of your original journey through there, you had horses after all, so we'll say you left them safely outside Payton.)</font><br />
[Sat Apr 23 21:05:46 2011] : <b>(158) Renate</b>: <font color='#000080'>(Ah, okay. That will shorten the time further.)</font><br />
[Sat Apr 23 21:07:06 2011] : <b>(155) Alan</b>: <font color='#612769'>After another single-file ride through the portal on the far side, you find yourselves back in more familiar lands, at the nexus entrance in Herrendon Deep.</font><br />
[Sat Apr 23 21:07:35 2011] : <b>(158) Renate</b>: <font color='#000080'>Through and out, then.</font><br />
[Sat Apr 23 21:08:05 2011] : <b>(155) Alan</b>: <font color='#612769'>The Grovekeeper is there to greet you; or at least, a tree's gnarled knot reveals itself as a face, which says, "Welcome back. I am glad you are safe. I learned too late of your peril. Forgive my ignorance."</font><br />
[Sat Apr 23 21:09:01 2011] : <b>(155) Alan</b>: <font color='#612769'>This is after you descend down through the Spirit World, of course. The Grovekeeper can't enter the Spirit World.</font><br />
[Sat Apr 23 21:10:54 2011] : <b>(156) Rien</b>: <font color='#263607'>"It couldn't be helped, so don't think on it."  Cutting right to the chase, Rien presents the Grovekeeper with the power signature he found for the Chaos power, plus the one from the altar to see if he recognises either of them.</font><br />
[Sat Apr 23 21:12:37 2011] : <b>(155) Alan</b>: <font color='#612769'>The Grovekeeper nods; or at least, the tree sways in a nonexistent wind. "The Chaos creature... I have never felt it before. I cannot travel into the Spirit World. I never stood before the nexus. I only knew of its existence through my magic."</font><br />
[Sat Apr 23 21:13:10 2011] : <b>(155) Alan</b>: <font color='#612769'>"The power of Order... I have never felt it either. It is neither angel nor demon. It lacks a flavor of its own."</font><br />
[Sat Apr 23 21:14:19 2011] : <b>(156) Rien</b>: <font color='#263607'>(And why not?  The world isn't binary, after all.  Who says that the Orders split completely into Angel and Demon?  Could not a third set have stood apart.  A sort of planar status quo?)</font><br />
[Sat Apr 23 21:16:00 2011] : <b>(155) Alan</b>: <font color='#612769'>(That's similar to Adam's guess.)</font><br />
[Sat Apr 23 21:16:05 2011] : <font color='#008000'>** (158) Renate <font color='#008000'>nudges Rien. There is a plan in the offing; the Grovekeeper should know about it.</font> **</font><br />
[Sat Apr 23 21:16:43 2011] : <b>(156) Rien</b>: <font color='#263607'>Rien explains the offing plan to the Grovekeeper as succinctly as he can.</font><br />
[Sat Apr 23 21:18:02 2011] : <b>(155) Alan</b>: <font color='#612769'>(Hm. I'm going to have to think about what his reaction would be; and also, this particular batch of plan-making is best conducted all in a row next session.)</font><br />
[Sat Apr 23 21:18:12 2011] : <b>(158) Renate</b>: <font color='#000080'>(Fair enough!)</font><br />
[Sat Apr 23 21:18:28 2011] : <b>(158) Renate</b>: <font color='#000080'>(But springing it on the poor critter seems totally unfair.)</font><br />
[Sat Apr 23 21:18:34 2011] : <b>(155) Alan</b>: <font color='#612769'>(I mean, aside from what his <i>thoughts</i> might be, I have to think how he'd react.)</font><br />
[Sat Apr 23 21:19:40 2011] : <b>(155) Alan</b>: <font color='#612769'>So you can come up with schemes next session; and Adam and Rien can work on some of the mechanics of it, so you'll know what's feasible and what's not.</font><br />
[Sat Apr 23 21:19:51 2011] : <b>(155) Alan</b>: <font color='#612769'>How close you have to get, and to who/what, and when.</font><br />
[Sat Apr 23 21:19:58 2011] : <b>(157) Aryk</b>: <font color='#800000'>Good idea, thought, to clue him in on the plan.  His reaction may be important!</font><br />
[Sat Apr 23 21:20:28 2011] : <b>(156) Rien</b>: <font color='#263607'>From the choices of "No, I don't want it." through "I like the plan, but perhaps someone else could receive the power?" to "muahahahahaha!  POWER!!!!11"</font><br />
[Sat Apr 23 21:20:53 2011] : <b>(158) Renate</b>: <font color='#000080'>Well, yes, and it's also just the right thing to do.</font><br />
[Sat Apr 23 21:20:57 2011] : <b>(157) Aryk</b>: <font color='#800000'>Power 11.  Shit.  That's the worst kind!</font><br />
[Sat Apr 23 21:21:03 2011] : <b>(158) Renate</b>: <font color='#000080'>We're asking a pretty major thing of him.</font><br />
[Sat Apr 23 21:22:12 2011] : <b>(157) Aryk</b>: <font color='#800000'>I'm reminded of the DC / Marvel crossover, when Supermand starts kicking Thor's ass, and all the Marvel guys are like "Huh?  He can't do that!"  And Supes is like "Looks like in my Universe, the dial goes to 11!"</font><br />
[Sat Apr 23 21:22:20 2011] : <b>(157) Aryk</b>: <font color='#800000'>Also, Supermand?</font><br />
[Sat Apr 23 21:22:39 2011] : <b>(155) Alan</b>: <font color='#612769'>He's a gourmand who can taste things nobody else can.</font><br />
[Sat Apr 23 21:22:47 2011] : <b>(157) Aryk</b>: <font color='#800000'>heh heh</font><br />
[Sat Apr 23 21:23:22 2011] : <b>(156) Rien</b>: <font color='#263607'>He also has the unlikely power of Superpretentiousness</font><br />
[Sat Apr 23 21:25:23 2011] : <b>(155) Alan</b>: <font color='#612769'>I'm going to have the unlikely power of taking a freakin' ibuprofen.</font><br />
[Sat Apr 23 21:25:28 2011] : <b>(155) Alan</b>: <font color='#612769'>See you guys next time!</font><br />
[Sat Apr 23 21:25:30 2011] : <b>(158) Renate</b>: <font color='#000080'>good plan</font><br />
