[Fri Feb 24 23:21:00 2006] : <B>(1) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>Keph has a bad reputation, but his public reputation is not as bad as the one he has with you guys specifically.</font><br>
[Fri Feb 24 23:21:32 2006] : <B>(1) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>Think of him as a government black ops guy -- odds are very good that he's killed innocent South Americans or something, but as long as he's on your side, you have to work with what you've got.</font><br>
[Fri Feb 24 23:21:51 2006] : <B>(1) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>This is in a realpolitik sense, not in a Renate-and-Aryk idealism sense.</font><br>

[Fri Feb 24 23:22:07 2006] : <B>(3) Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>Eh. I'd say that Renate would negotiate to keep Solaris out of it -- but for once, Renate is not in a negotiating mood.</font><br>

[Fri Feb 24 23:22:41 2006] : <B>(1) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>(Keph and the as-yet-unnamed Explodist could have handled it.)</font><br>
[Fri Feb 24 23:24:36 2006] : <B>(3) Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>Besides, Keph has pretty much already declared an intent to attack Our Heroes.</font><br>

[Fri Feb 24 23:25:37 2006] : <B>(1) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>Well, he'd probably try to defuse the situation, but the moment he realized it was serious, he'd try to change the venue at least.</font><br>
