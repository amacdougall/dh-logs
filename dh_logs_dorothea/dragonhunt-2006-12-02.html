[Sat Dec 02 11:14:51 2006] : <B>(1) Alan</B>: <font color='#000000'>Log is on!</font><br>
[Sat Dec 02 11:15:18 2006] : <B>(1) Alan</B>: <font color='#000000'>Uh, so if I recall, we had backtracked to the bow's last murder, and found that it was way back in the 1500s or earlier.</font><br>
[Sat Dec 02 11:15:42 2006] : <B>(1) Alan</B>: <font color='#000000'>The next step was to try tracing Renate's immediate past.</font><br>
[Sat Dec 02 11:16:20 2006] : <B>(2) Rien</B>: <font color='#004000'>Yep</font><br>
[Sat Dec 02 11:17:03 2006] : <B>(3) Aryk</B>: <font color='#a40000'>That is correct.</font><br>
[Sat Dec 02 11:17:51 2006] : <B>(1) Alan</B>: <font color='#000000'>"This may be more dangerous," the professor says; his voice comes from far away, carried on a wind, and his face is a white shimmer against the endless black of the void zone.</font><br>
[Sat Dec 02 11:18:24 2006] : <B>(1) Alan</B>: <font color='#000000'>"If Renate's body came to you from the netherworld, then she may have been killed there. Visiting the past of the netherworld can create dangerous loops which crack like whips."</font><br>
[Sat Dec 02 11:18:43 2006] : <B>(1) Alan</B>: <font color='#000000'>"Imagine visiting an image of the past of an area which is, itself, an image of the past."</font><br>
[Sat Dec 02 11:19:36 2006] : <B>(1) Alan</B>: <font color='#000000'>"If anything untoward should occur, I can find you, with time, but cannot protect you until I do. You will be left to defend yourselves... just know that, for most, the past is no more dangerous than the present."</font><br>
[Sat Dec 02 11:20:51 2006] : <B>(1) Alan</B>: <font color='#000000'>"Now... let us see what is beyond this particular veil."</font><br>
[Sat Dec 02 11:21:15 2006] : <B>(3) Aryk</B>: <font color='#a40000'>Aryk nods.  "I think I understand.  It... doesn't matter.  We'll do what it takes."</font><br>
[Sat Dec 02 11:21:53 2006] : <B>(1) Alan</B>: <font color='#000000'>The void zone does not change; but motes of darkness shift in its background, providing a sense of movement and depth.</font><br>
[Sat Dec 02 11:23:11 2006] : <B>(1) Alan</B>: <font color='#000000'>"As I feared... I can see, here, a Cubriani interchange, along the q axis. She entered a portal to the netherworld that was along her memorized route."</font><br>
[Sat Dec 02 11:24:15 2006] : <B>(3) Aryk</B>: <font color='#a40000'>"Did... someone set her up to walk through it?"</font><br>
[Sat Dec 02 11:24:31 2006] : <B>(1) Alan</B>: <font color='#000000'>"Blind, she walked into it before she realized it was there. The interchange is subtle... its location on the t axis, the dimension of time, is indeterminate."</font><br>
[Sat Dec 02 11:24:49 2006] : <B>(1) Alan</B>: <font color='#000000'>"No wonder I did not sense the portal's creation at the time."</font><br>
[Sat Dec 02 11:25:22 2006] : <B>(1) Alan</B>: <font color='#000000'>"Ah... ah." The professor's voice takes on a note of worry. "This explains all. The portal was opened from the netherworld side."</font><br>
[Sat Dec 02 11:25:52 2006] : <B>(2) Rien</B>: <font color='#004000'>Something about this sets a flow of calculations running through Rien's head; probability, quasi-temoral-dynamics...</font><br>
[Sat Dec 02 11:26:15 2006] : <B>(2) Rien</B>: <font color='#004000'>"And its time is an indeterminate figure..."</font><br>
[Sat Dec 02 11:26:40 2006] : <B>(3) Aryk</B>: <font color='#a40000'>"Someone from the netherworld opened this portal?  Is that possible?  Does that kind of thing happen often?!"</font><br>
[Sat Dec 02 11:27:16 2006] : <B>(2) Rien</B>: <font color='#004000'>"Professor, you said that the bow had a determined future?"</font><br>
[Sat Dec 02 11:27:19 2006] : <B>(1) Alan</B>: <font color='#000000'>"No, it does not. I do not have the art myself."</font><br>
[Sat Dec 02 11:27:38 2006] : <B>(1) Alan</B>: <font color='#000000'>"Yes. I have begun to form a hypothesis."</font><br>
[Sat Dec 02 11:27:56 2006] : <B>(1) Alan</B>: <font color='#000000'>"I expect you are thinking along the same line."</font><br>
[Sat Dec 02 11:28:45 2006] : <B>(1) Alan</B>: <font color='#000000'>"Shall we go and see what becomes of the bow in the future? It will be as dangerous as following Renate's past... but is more likely to bear fruit."</font><br>
[Sat Dec 02 11:29:24 2006] : <B>(2) Rien</B>: <font color='#004000'>"Yes.  I believe that the reason the bow, now, has no increase in charge, and that you never knew of its movement away from you, is that it has not yet happened."</font><br>
[Sat Dec 02 11:30:05 2006] : <B>(1) Alan</B>: <font color='#000000'>"But as you know, anyone who stepped off the true course of time, whether in the Overworld or the netherworld, would risk being lost forever in shadows of past and future."</font><br>

[Sat Dec 02 11:30:30 2006] : <B>(2) Rien</B>: <font color='#004000'>"Does this also apply to the spirits who reside here?"</font><br>
[Sat Dec 02 11:30:42 2006] : <B>(3) Aryk</B>: <font color='#a40000'>"Well, if they're already dead... what have they got to lose?"</font><br>
[Sat Dec 02 11:31:20 2006] : <B>(1) Alan</B>: <font color='#000000'>"The souls of the dead... the vast majority simply float upward on their journey to the Celestium, or downward to the material world as ghosts, but there are a few, a scant few, who achieve an equilibrium."</font><br>
[Sat Dec 02 11:32:25 2006] : <B>(1) Alan</B>: <font color='#000000'>"But it is a useless existence; only those who fear the Celestium and ghosthood alike would choose it for themselves."</font><br>
[Sat Dec 02 11:32:38 2006] : <B>(2) Rien</B>: <font color='#004000'>"What about those who are maintained by a Patron?"</font><br>
[Sat Dec 02 11:33:12 2006] : <B>(1) Alan</B>: <font color='#000000'>"There are a few who retain such astral messengers. And none good."</font><br>
[Sat Dec 02 11:33:47 2006] : <B>(2) Rien</B>: <font color='#004000'>"No, I did not think so.  Do they run the same risk of being caught, seeing as how they are already mostly outside time?"</font><br>
[Sat Dec 02 11:35:16 2006] : <B>(1) Alan</B>: <font color='#000000'>"The risk they run is one of madness, the loss of reality; where a shifting time loop spirals off from our own timeline and careens endlessly into... who can say. Let us go quickly; even if time is irrelevant to this contretemps, I feel the need for action."</font><br>
[Sat Dec 02 11:35:40 2006] : <B>(3) Aryk</B>: <font color='#a40000'>"Now he's talking my language."</font><br>
[Sat Dec 02 11:36:09 2006] : <B>(1) Alan</B>: <font color='#000000'>"If the bow's future shows when and how it was stolen, we can simply prevent it from ever having happened. Erase it from the future."</font><br>

[Sat Dec 02 11:38:24 2006] : <B>(1) Alan</B>: <font color='#000000'>(Just got a call. Done now.)</font><br>

[Sat Dec 02 11:41:15 2006] : <B>(1) Alan</B>: <font color='#000000'>But the void zone has already twisted around you. "Here," the professor says, "is another Cubriani interchange. The bow itself is in the laboratory in the void zone in the present, and is still there in the future... so we are entering shadows of the netherworld itself now."</font><br>
[Sat Dec 02 11:41:24 2006] : <B>(1) Alan</B>: <font color='#000000'>"There."</font><br>
[Sat Dec 02 11:41:56 2006] : <B>(1) Alan</B>: <font color='#000000'>The black of the void zone clicks over to blank white; but not the brilliant white of a snowfield, but the dull featureless white of cheap paper.</font><br>

[Sat Dec 02 11:44:15 2006] : <B>(1) Alan</B>: <font color='#000000'>The professor draws a cut in the air with a finger, and a rift opens which leads into the comfortable laboratory you started in&#8212;or at least, its astral future image.</font><br>

[Sat Dec 02 11:46:31 2006] : <B>(1) Alan</B>: <font color='#000000'>The rift leads into the cozy living quarters; from the inside, it looks like a perfectly normal doorway.</font><br>

[Sat Dec 02 13:12:09 2006] : <B>(1) Alan</B>: <font color='#000000'>An encounter is happening down on the artificial beach; it isn't quite a battle, but rather a series of standoffs in which some of the participants seem to be changing loyalties from movement to movement.</font><br>
[Sat Dec 02 13:13:02 2006] : <B>(1) Alan</B>: <font color='#000000'>"This went on for a while," Kip says. "The point is that there were street gangs, Ruido Grande, various CEOs from the Montequido group, and politicos, all wanted to betray each other."</font><br>
[Sat Dec 02 13:13:15 2006] : <B>(1) Alan</B>: <font color='#000000'>"It ended up... ah, here we go. The snap decision."</font><br>
[Sat Dec 02 13:14:06 2006] : <B>(1) Alan</B>: <font color='#000000'>You can barely tell who is who, but once Kip points it out, it's easy to see Kip's father win over an assembly other other participants, and hold a sword over Rodrigo Montequido's neck.</font><br>
[Sat Dec 02 13:14:37 2006] : <B>(1) Alan</B>: <font color='#000000'>"He pretty much had it sewn up at this point," Kip says. "Julio Sandriano, king of Credo Vallar."</font><br>

[Sat Dec 02 13:16:42 2006] : <B>(1) Alan</B>: <font color='#000000'>Kip steps off the ledge, appearing confident that the scene will change; and it does, to a coal car in the dead of night, with a bloody and crippled Kip Sandriano half buried under a pile of bauxite, trundling off to who knows where.</font><br>

[Sat Dec 02 13:20:29 2006] : <B>(1) Alan</B>: <font color='#000000'>The scene changes again, to a leafless forest in midwinter. There is nobody around.</font><br>
