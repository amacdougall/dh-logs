[Fri Oct 13 19:13:22 2006] : <B>(2) Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>BTW, I was thinking about it (because I felt guilty), and I came to the conclusion that sneaking around the palace would have been a really stupid thing for Renate to do.</font><br>
[Fri Oct 13 19:13:53 2006] : <B>(2) Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>One, she doesn't understand the language. Two, there are all those invisible dudes all over the place. Three, hobgoblin culture thrives on honor, and sneaking around is dishonorable.</font><br>
[Fri Oct 13 19:14:04 2006] : <B>(2) Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>(Unless you can lay claim to being a ninja, and Renate really can't.)</font><br>

[Fri Oct 13 19:15:10 2006] : <B>(2) Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>That's not what you said LAST time. :P</font><br>
[Fri Oct 13 19:17:01 2006] : <B>(1) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>Sometimes it is, just not this particular time. What I meant was that you'd get some extra information.</font><br>
[Fri Oct 13 19:18:01 2006] : <B>(1) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>Log is on.</font><br>
[Fri Oct 13 19:19:35 2006] : <B>(1) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>Whatever the general and the king are discussing, it's taking a while; the food is cooling off, and the servant assigned to your room has inquired of your further needs twice.</font><br>
[Fri Oct 13 19:19:58 2006] : <B>(1) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>More than is strictly necessary; but odds are his visits have a security aspect.</font><br>
[Fri Oct 13 19:20:35 2006] : <font color='#008000'>** (2) Renate suspects as much, and takes care not to pace or fiddle with things. Only polite. **</font><br>
[Fri Oct 13 19:21:19 2006] : <font color='#008000'>** (4) Aryk appears asleep, reclining in a chair, head hanging back over the top. **</font><br>
[Fri Oct 13 19:21:29 2006] : <font color='#008000'>** (3) Rien also makes sure they consume enough of the food to be polite, instead of looking like they're snubbing the delicacies offered to them. **</font><br>
[Fri Oct 13 19:22:30 2006] : <B>(1) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>"At length," as they say, the deputy castellan arrives, flanked by hobgoblin royal guards. "His majesty will receive you now. This meeting is... it translates as 'off the throne.' You may address His Majesty as a superior instead of as a monarch." She pauses a moment, lips pursed.</font><br>
[Fri Oct 13 19:23:04 2006] : <B>(1) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>"That may not be informative. Let's just say that if you knew the rituals of the court, well, this is easier."</font><br>
[Fri Oct 13 19:23:11 2006] : <font color='#008000'>** (2) Renate stands up, then pauses to let Rien precede her. **</font><br>
[Fri Oct 13 19:23:36 2006] : <B>(2) Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>"What is the customary form of address for such occasions?" she asks.</font><br>
[Fri Oct 13 19:23:43 2006] : <B>(1) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>"Please, accompany us." This time, the royal guards take the front and rear, removing the need to "precede" anybody.</font><br>
[Fri Oct 13 19:24:27 2006] : <font color='#008000'>** (4) Aryk starts awake, rubs his eyes, and stands to follow. **</font><br>
[Fri Oct 13 19:24:44 2006] : <B>(1) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>"In the trade tongue? Simply 'your majesty,' or 'sire.' This sort of reception simply allows a normal conversation."</font><br>
[Fri Oct 13 19:25:05 2006] : <B>(1) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>"Instead of rules of order, and invocations of saints, and... oh, it goes on."</font><br>
[Fri Oct 13 19:26:19 2006] : <B>(4) Aryk</B>: <font color='#000080'>"Is the general still present," Aryk inquires, fully alert.</font><br>
[Fri Oct 13 19:27:29 2006] : <B>(1) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>The guards lead you from the guest wing back to the wing that houses the great hall; there is a miniature plaza here, suites surrounding an indoor garden. The guards stop before a guarded door and exchange ritual greetings with their counterparts.</font><br>
[Fri Oct 13 19:28:32 2006] : <B>(1) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>"He, like the king, is in recess from the ceremony. It is likely that they will discuss their real business in the course of an informal session just like this one."</font><br>
[Fri Oct 13 19:28:53 2006] : <B>(1) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>"But before that can occur, there is formal business to be conducted&#8212;most of it completely formulaic."</font><br>
[Fri Oct 13 19:29:10 2006] : <B>(1) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>"And here we are," she says as the guards exchange positions.</font><br>
[Fri Oct 13 19:29:37 2006] : <B>(1) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>She knocks lightly on the door, and a servant opens it. They exchange brief words, then the door is opened wide.</font><br>
[Fri Oct 13 19:31:32 2006] : <B>(1) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>This cedar-planked room complements the hothouse garden "outside"; it is cluttered with plants and flowers in remarkably beautiful combinations. It is lit only by isolated candles, and by moonlight pouring in from the spacious skylights.</font><br>
[Fri Oct 13 19:31:59 2006] : <font color='#008000'>** (3) Rien nods graciously to them, and walks in, Renate and Aryk in his wake. **</font><br>
[Fri Oct 13 19:32:45 2006] : <B>(1) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>Royal guards lurk in the corners left dark by the candles; but the king and his companion sit quietly in the full moonlight, sharing cups of a steaming liquid at a mid-sized wood table.</font><br>
[Fri Oct 13 19:33:19 2006] : <font color='#008000'>** (4) Aryk adjusts his collar. **</font><br>
[Fri Oct 13 19:33:35 2006] : <B>(1) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>The king is an aging hobgoblin with a flowing beard that seems almost part of his complex formal robes.</font><br>
[Fri Oct 13 19:33:54 2006] : <B>(1) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>An intelligent light twinkles in his large black eyes.</font><br>
[Fri Oct 13 19:34:10 2006] : <font color='#008000'>** (2) Renate studies him, without seeming to. **</font><br>
[Fri Oct 13 19:35:00 2006] : <B>(2) Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>Is his companion Hideki?</font><br>
[Fri Oct 13 19:35:06 2006] : <B>(1) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>His other guest is a human male, although it's almost hard to tell for a moment; he's possessed of an almost androgynous beauty, like an angel.</font><br>
[Fri Oct 13 19:35:28 2006] : <B>(1) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>His long blond hair picks up even the slightest candle-light.</font><br>
[Fri Oct 13 19:37:01 2006] : <B>(1) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>He is the first to turn to you newcomers. "Normally I would be honored to share your presence, storied heroes," he says in a crystalline tenor, "but I fear the company of monarchs leaves little room for further honor."</font><br>
[Fri Oct 13 19:37:37 2006] : <font color='#008000'>** (3) Rien stops the approed distance before the throne, and gives a deep, courtly bow ot the king, "your Majesty, it is an honor to meet you at last." **</font><br>
[Fri Oct 13 19:38:39 2006] : <B>(1) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>The king turns now, as though he had awaited the cue. "Your Highness, you are welcome in my land. Until you misbehave," he says with a cautionary waggle of a finger.</font><br>
[Fri Oct 13 19:38:52 2006] : <font color='#008000'>** (4) Aryk is obviously a little nervous.  He thinks it best to keep quiet. **</font><br>
[Fri Oct 13 19:39:14 2006] : <B>(2) Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>(Is this companion a dragon?)</font><br>
[Fri Oct 13 19:39:21 2006] : <B>(1) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>"Please, do not introduce needless ceremony. Just sit, and let us talk. I know who you three are."</font><br>
[Fri Oct 13 19:39:25 2006] : <B>(1) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>(You can't tell yet.)</font><br>
[Fri Oct 13 19:39:29 2006] : <B>(1) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>(He hasn't scanned you at least.)</font><br>
[Fri Oct 13 19:39:36 2006] : <B>(2) Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>(Okay.)</font><br>
[Fri Oct 13 19:39:52 2006] : <B>(1) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>"Let me introduce my friend&#8212;it is quite a luxury to be able to introduce someone else."</font><br>
[Fri Oct 13 19:40:27 2006] : <B>(4) Aryk</B>: <font color='#000080'>"He... knows us?" Aryk murmurs.</font><br>
[Fri Oct 13 19:40:31 2006] : <font color='#008000'>** (3) Rien gives an apparently genuine laugh, soft through it is.  He sits in the directed place, arranging himself carefully. **</font><br>
[Fri Oct 13 19:40:58 2006] : <font color='#008000'>** (2) Renate shrugs a bare millimeter. She suspects it is this -- individual's -- duty to know things. **</font><br>
[Fri Oct 13 19:41:29 2006] : <font color='#008000'>** (4) Aryk waits for Rien to sit, and then glances around and finds himself an appropriate place to sit himself. **</font><br>
[Fri Oct 13 19:41:33 2006] : <B>(1) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>"This is Joaquin 'Silver Coin' Sirius, dragonrank. Most famously, the ex-head of the Guild of Bards."</font><br>
[Fri Oct 13 19:41:47 2006] : <B>(2) Renate</B>: <font color='#000080'>Without a word, she arranges herself decorously a little behind Rien and to one side.</font><br>
[Fri Oct 13 19:42:13 2006] : <B>(1) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>"Not so famous," the man in question replies with humor. "Since most people don't know such a guild exists."</font><br>
[Fri Oct 13 19:42:24 2006] : <B>(1) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>"including," he says ruefully, "quite a few bards."</font><br>
[Fri Oct 13 19:42:37 2006] : <font color='#008000'>** (4) Aryk manages a nod in return. **</font><br>
[Fri Oct 13 19:42:57 2006] : <B>(1) Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>(Rien doesn't notice any special marks on Joaquin's head; but he didn't on Evantin Barious either. Presumably they disappear once a candidate attains dragonrank.)</font><br>
