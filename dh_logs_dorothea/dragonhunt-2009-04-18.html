[Sat Apr 18 01:14:25 2009] : <b>(25228) Alan</b>: <font color='#000080'>Log is off!</font><br />
[Sat Apr 18 01:15:03 2009] : <b>(25229) Aryk</b>: <font color='#710000'>Okay, so, is this something you had planned, or a plan that formed because of what Aryk has been doing?</font><br />
[Sat Apr 18 01:15:41 2009] : <b>(25228) Alan</b>: <font color='#000080'>Both. The inner circle of the Church is secretly faithful to the human interpretation of angelic ideals more than to the actual commands of the angels (you will find this to be a theme, long story though).</font><br />
[Sat Apr 18 01:16:17 2009] : <b>(25229) Aryk</b>: <font color='#710000'>I thought when Rob was playing Daine he was pretty by-the-book.</font><br />
[Sat Apr 18 01:16:29 2009] : <b>(25228) Alan</b>: <font color='#000080'>You were going to end up either joining the inner circle of the Church, or joining Adam Mayonet's Aspect Knights; I got the impression much earlier that you were tending toward a different interpretation than Adam.</font><br />
[Sat Apr 18 01:16:50 2009] : <b>(25228) Alan</b>: <font color='#000080'>I never put Rob through the same kinds of tests.</font><br />
[Sat Apr 18 01:17:29 2009] : <b>(25228) Alan</b>: <font color='#000080'>Despite many surface similarities, the Order of Tourendel (and corresponding clergy orders) have fundamental differences with the Aspect Knights.</font><br />
[Sat Apr 18 01:17:37 2009] : <b>(25228) Alan</b>: <font color='#000080'>You seemed to lean more Church.</font><br />
[Sat Apr 18 01:17:38 2009] : <b>(25229) Aryk</b>: <font color='#710000'>Well, I wouldn't have challenged them in the same way.  But I have a feeling if Adam knew about this he'd question his methods.</font><br />
[Sat Apr 18 01:18:20 2009] : <b>(25228) Alan</b>: <font color='#000080'>So instead of giving you an explicit choice, I had the groups respond to Aryk's own actions by having the Order of Tourendel decide to induct him, while the Aspect Knights just didn't seek him out like they might have.</font><br />
[Sat Apr 18 01:19:09 2009] : <b>(25228) Alan</b>: <font color='#000080'>So, it was based on Aryk's actions without being purely mechanistic.</font><br />
[Sat Apr 18 01:19:27 2009] : <b>(25229) Aryk</b>: <font color='#710000'>This is fine.  Great even.  It's the basis of what Aryk wanted.  But now, of course, he's going to have to kill Adam.</font><br />
[Sat Apr 18 01:19:37 2009] : <b>(25228) Alan</b>: <font color='#000080'>Or something, yeah.</font><br />
[Sat Apr 18 01:19:42 2009] : <b>(25229) Aryk</b>: <font color='#710000'>Heh.</font><br />
[Sat Apr 18 01:19:57 2009] : <b>(25230) Sabra</b>: <font color='#000080'>Sabra says "hey, I get dibs."</font><br />
[Sat Apr 18 01:20:10 2009] : <b>(25228) Alan</b>: <font color='#000080'>Adam's movement ends up in an interesting place (given that Aryk doesn't support it; neither did Daine in the Zion game, so it'll probably turn out about the same.)</font><br />
[Sat Apr 18 01:20:24 2009] : <b>(25229) Aryk</b>: <font color='#710000'>Seriously, though, Aryk will have to ask them why they haven't approached Adam.</font><br />
[Sat Apr 18 01:20:54 2009] : <b>(25228) Alan</b>: <font color='#000080'>It ends up taking a theological direction substantially different from Adam's, one unseen elsewhere in the game world in all history.</font><br />
[Sat Apr 18 01:21:07 2009] : <b>(25230) Sabra</b>: <font color='#000080'>Renate never liked Adam much.</font><br />
[Sat Apr 18 01:21:10 2009] : <b>(25228) Alan</b>: <font color='#000080'>So that's something!</font><br />
[Sat Apr 18 01:21:19 2009] : <b>(25230) Sabra</b>: <font color='#000080'>And Sabra has her own reasons for not being entirely fond of him.</font><br />
[Sat Apr 18 01:22:13 2009] : <b>(25228) Alan</b>: <font color='#000080'>Well, the idea was that if Aryk liked the concept enough -- getting powers directly from the True King, opposing the Church directly, trying to convert demon-worshippers away from their demons as well -- then Aryk could have just taken over.</font><br />
[Sat Apr 18 01:22:17 2009] : <b>(25229) Aryk</b>: <font color='#710000'>Well, yeah.  </font><br />
[Sat Apr 18 01:22:37 2009] : <b>(25228) Alan</b>: <font color='#000080'>Adam was intentionally portrayed as a supplantable leader for the movement. Maybe it wasn't clear enough.</font><br />
[Sat Apr 18 01:22:53 2009] : <b>(25230) Sabra</b>: <font color='#000080'>Hm. Interesting.</font><br />
[Sat Apr 18 01:23:00 2009] : <b>(25230) Sabra</b>: <font color='#000080'>Maybe Sabra'll go kick his ass out.</font><br />
[Sat Apr 18 01:23:22 2009] : <b>(25229) Aryk</b>: <font color='#710000'>Hm.  But Aryk's never wanted to oppose the church.  Not like that, anyway.</font><br />
[Sat Apr 18 01:23:32 2009] : <b>(25228) Alan</b>: <font color='#000080'>Well, would she join the Order of Converging Lines, the Gabrielite equivalent?</font><br />
[Sat Apr 18 01:23:35 2009] : <b>(25229) Aryk</b>: <font color='#710000'>He just wants to give it a swift kick in the ass.</font><br />
[Sat Apr 18 01:24:01 2009] : <b>(25228) Alan</b>: <font color='#000080'>She and Randall each have to make their own choice independent of one another. Randall will join his inner circle order just because he wants to know what's going on on the inside.</font><br />
[Sat Apr 18 01:24:09 2009] : <b>(25228) Alan</b>: <font color='#000080'>Sabra, probably for identical reason?</font><br />
[Sat Apr 18 01:24:15 2009] : <b>(25230) Sabra</b>: <font color='#000080'>After a hell of a mutual interrogation... maybe. ;)</font><br />
