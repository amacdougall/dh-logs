[Sun Feb 12 19:23:35 2006] : <B>Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>Mine was Buttered.</font><br>
[Sun Feb 12 19:24:00 2006] : <B>Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>Log is on; was just hunting around for the file name.</font><br>
[Sun Feb 12 19:25:45 2006] : <B>Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>Cordelus Green was originally designed as a corporate campus with a few modern and airy executive residences; surely, the board of directors agreed, the needs of the laborers in the Timbers would be met by boom towns set up by third-party entrepreneurs.</font><br>
[Sun Feb 12 19:27:24 2006] : <B>Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>As it happened, those third-party entrepreneurs found it very convenient to set up shop at the minimum allowed distance from the manicured grounds of Cordelus Green; and predictably, the middle ranks of the corporate beehive found themselves enjoying the cheap booze and&#8212;let us say&#8212;banquet of pleasures provided by those more modest facilities.</font><br>
[Sun Feb 12 19:28:27 2006] : <B>Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>The crude barracks and saloons spread and, as the financial potential of the Timbers began to develop, they became home to hundreds and thousands of permanent residents.</font><br>
[Sun Feb 12 19:29:45 2006] : <B>Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>Cordelus Green is dense and confusing, for the most part; packed-earth streets run at odd angles, plank sidewalks are in a permanent duel with wild-growing vines, and every vista is choked with imported trees which grow quickly and tall in the nutrient-rich soil.</font><br>
[Sun Feb 12 19:30:51 2006] : <B>Tancred</B>: <font color='#000080'>A hollow-eyed madman with a useless left hand wanders the streets more or less at random -- less, when the compulsion steers him.</font><br>
[Sun Feb 12 19:31:29 2006] : <B>Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>So the transition to Inner Cordelus is a startling one; crossing a certain stream over a certain tall arched bridge leads from shady twisting lanes into a broad flat expanse of shaved green grass and glimmering blue pools, scattered reflective white buildings.</font><br>
[Sun Feb 12 19:31:46 2006] : <B>Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>The landscape looks like an architect's concept.</font><br>
[Sun Feb 12 19:32:51 2006] : <B>Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>Tancred is not entirely out of place on the streets of Cordelus Green; sometimes the Timbers drive men to madness, or bad decisions leave them stranded jobless in a land with no other civilization for a hundred klicks.</font><br>
[Sun Feb 12 19:33:13 2006] : <B>Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>Other pedestrians avoid Tancred's eyes, and clutch their pocketbooks; but he is a nuisance, not a threat.</font><br>
[Sun Feb 12 19:33:13 2006] : <B>Sashi</B>: <font color='#004040'>Across the rooftops above him, moving like a shadow, a girl clad in black leather follows him, staying carefully out of sight.</font><br>
[Sun Feb 12 19:34:35 2006] : <B>Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>Inner Cordelus was designed as a unit, and the outer city was built at arm's length from it; so the approaches to the glimmering white buildings of the corporate park are lanes largely devoid of hiding spots.</font><br>
[Sun Feb 12 19:34:52 2006] : <B>Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>If she's self-taught, odds are that Sashi can't Fade yet.</font><br>
[Sun Feb 12 19:35:20 2006] : <B>Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>That particular discipline requires either an exceptional talent, or a teacher.</font><br>
[Sun Feb 12 19:35:52 2006] : <B>Sashi</B>: <font color='#004040'>(she's not wholly self-taught.  She's had bits of training here and there among other rogues, including a K`Siri, and Masan)</font><br>
[Sun Feb 12 19:36:12 2006] : <B>Sashi</B>: <font color='#004040'>(a lot of her skills is self-taught, but there's been more added to it)</font><br>
[Sun Feb 12 19:36:26 2006] : <B>Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>(Ah, forgot about that. When did Masan Ahim teach her? I do remember saying something about it.)</font><br>
[Sun Feb 12 19:37:37 2006] : <B>Sashi</B>: <font color='#004040'>(She ran with Coris' crew for a couple of months maybe 18 months ago)</font><br>
[Sun Feb 12 19:37:50 2006] : <B>Sashi</B>: <font color='#004040'>(Well, ran isn't quite true,so much as 'tried to steal from them')</font><br>
[Sun Feb 12 19:38:12 2006] : <B>Sashi</B>: <font color='#004040'>(then was offered training in return for service for a little while, and the extension of breathing privelidges)</font><br>
[Sun Feb 12 19:38:24 2006] : <B>Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>(Ah, gotcha.)</font><br>
[Sun Feb 12 19:39:04 2006] : <B>Tancred</B>: <font color='#000080'>(hmmmmm...)</font><br>
[Sun Feb 12 19:39:42 2006] : <B>Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>With careful situational awareness, Sashi is able to find a gap in attention and transfer from the shade trees of the outer city to the ornamental grasses and flowerbeds of the inner.</font><br>
[Sun Feb 12 19:40:22 2006] : <B>Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>Much of the inner grounds are planted with foreign grasses and carefully mowed, but many parts are also kept as native prairie.</font><br>
[Sun Feb 12 19:41:57 2006] : <B>Tancred</B>: <font color='#000080'>"Innes Institute... few blocks... which way?" Tancred mumbles to himself.</font><br>
[Sun Feb 12 19:43:32 2006] : <B>Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>There are signs hanging from streetlamps; the street names appear to be in alphabetic order.</font><br>
[Sun Feb 12 19:44:49 2006] : <B>Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>Menkhda helpfully displays a list of the symbols used in the writing, in their traditional order; as you pass Obroa Street, it appears Ntada Street is fairly near the city center.</font><br>
[Sun Feb 12 19:45:11 2006] : <font color='#008000'>** Tancred shrinks closer to the walls, as though it would help. **</font><br>
[Sun Feb 12 19:45:57 2006] : <B>Sashi</B>: <font color='#004040'>Sashi shakes her head over this.  He sticks out worse than a black rose in a field of lillies.  Being conciously surrupticious just makes it worse.</font><br>
[Sun Feb 12 19:46:10 2006] : <B>Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>Most of Inner Cordelus is open space, plains and parks; where there are buildings, they are sweeping artistic jumbles hiding cubicle farms.</font><br>
[Sun Feb 12 19:46:52 2006] : <B>Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>Workers occasionally pass by in small groups, wearing conservative fashions; they look at Tancred with sadness and distaste.</font><br>
[Sun Feb 12 19:47:13 2006] : <B>Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>As long as he keeps walking, the corporate security guards don't seem to see fit to accost him.</font><br>
[Sun Feb 12 19:47:35 2006] : <B>Tancred</B>: <font color='#000080'>He keeps walking, muttering to himself.</font><br>
[Sun Feb 12 19:49:03 2006] : <B>Tancred</B>: <font color='#000080'>Without consciously meaning to, he stands straighter, takes on more of the air of the Sealed Librarian and less the bereaved lunatic.</font><br>
[Sun Feb 12 19:49:38 2006] : <B>Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>The restaurant is housed in a long soaring building which seems to contain dozens of stores; galleries run along either side of it, with shop signs hanging from every fifth arch.</font><br>
[Sun Feb 12 19:50:23 2006] : <B>Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>The name "Rolan" is written in three dominant Valinese languages and, surprisingly, the script common to the Northrock and Lan'yarian languages.</font><br>
[Sun Feb 12 19:50:58 2006] : <B>Tancred</B>: <font color='#000080'>Tancred sniffs. "Misspelled," he says, disgusted, and marches toward the maitre d'.</font><br>
[Sun Feb 12 19:52:13 2006] : <B>Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>Tancred has been through a lot, but he is not yet completely ragged as long as he puts on a brave face; the hostess on duty puts on a habitual smile and greets him.</font><br>
[Sun Feb 12 19:52:52 2006] : <B>Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>"One, sir?"</font><br>
[Sun Feb 12 19:53:16 2006] : <B>Tancred</B>: <font color='#000080'>"I am expecting another," Tancred says, trusting Yewey to cover his speech. "Megan Joster?"</font><br>
[Sun Feb 12 19:55:06 2006] : <B>Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>"Yes, sir, Mrs. Joster is already dining. She is inside, by the window."</font><br>
[Sun Feb 12 19:55:26 2006] : <B>Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>She points to a specific window that looks out into the gallery.</font><br>
[Sun Feb 12 19:55:30 2006] : <B>Tancred</B>: <font color='#000080'>"Ah, thank you." Tancred proceeds to the indicated table.</font><br>
[Sun Feb 12 19:57:03 2006] : <B>Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>Megan Joster is a late middle-aged woman with salt-and-pepper hair and a pensive expression. Her clothing looks like lab wear; some obscure instrument hangs around her neck.</font><br>
[Sun Feb 12 19:57:12 2006] : <B>Tancred</B>: <font color='#000080'>"Madam Joster? Tancred Lasalle, of Eldorado, at your service."</font><br>
[Sun Feb 12 19:57:48 2006] : <B>Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>She looks up from a sheaf of papers with annoyance. "I already bought one."</font><br>
[Sun Feb 12 19:58:14 2006] : <B>Tancred</B>: <font color='#000080'>Tancred laughs, just a touch too loudly. "I don't think you did. May I sit down?"</font><br>
[Sun Feb 12 19:58:56 2006] : <B>Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>"Please state your business, sir," she says, pointedly not giving permission; but then, "...Eldorado, in Northrock?"</font><br>
[Sun Feb 12 19:59:07 2006] : <font color='#008000'>** Tancred nods silently. **</font><br>

[Sun Feb 12 20:36:08 2006] : <B>Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>Well, it seems like everyone who goes in or out of this building does so by a three-step process.</font><br>
[Sun Feb 12 20:36:51 2006] : <B>Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>First, they hold an ID card up to a white stone(?) box which matches its dimensions; the box emits a friendly bell chime.</font><br>

[Sun Feb 12 20:38:10 2006] : <B>Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>One or twice, Sashi finds that the arch gives off a pinging noise, at which point the entrant laughs self-consciously and hands the security guard a pocketknife or something before walking through it again.</font><br>
[Sun Feb 12 20:38:23 2006] : <B>Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>The entryway is designed so that the arch is hard to go around, and the guard has a clear view of the entrance lobby.</font><br>

[Sun Feb 12 20:46:03 2006] : <B>Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>The building is a tower; at its base, it's about twenty meters to a side, which isn't terribly much. Past the lobby, Sashi can see that there are stairs leading both up and down, suggesting that there may be a lot going on in the basements.</font><br>
[Sun Feb 12 20:46:35 2006] : <B>Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>There's a shift change at one point, and the number of people going in and out the building definitely doesn't match the relatively small tower portion.</font><br>

[Sun Feb 12 20:47:38 2006] : <B>Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>After a while, Sashi would probably notice a distinct humming, as of a steam engine or something running deep underground.</font><br>

[Sun Feb 12 20:57:01 2006] : <B>Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>No windows at ground level at all, as mentioned before.</font><br>
[Sun Feb 12 20:57:37 2006] : <B>Sashi</B>: <font color='#004040'>Oh, sorry, missed that.</font><br>
[Sun Feb 12 20:58:26 2006] : <B>Sashi</B>: <font color='#004040'>Okay... so it looks like Sashi's going to go mugging, then.</font><br>
[Sun Feb 12 20:58:44 2006] : <B>Sashi</B>: <font color='#004040'>She'll find someone (if she can) who's about her height and weight, and take their coat and card.</font><br>
[Sun Feb 12 20:58:54 2006] : <B>Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>Employees exit the building every now and then; since they got in, clearly their cards work.</font><br>
[Sun Feb 12 20:59:55 2006] : <B>Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>A man and woman leave, nodding to the guard; they look tired, and one has what appears to be a bloodstain on his lab coat.</font><br>
[Sun Feb 12 21:00:32 2006] : <B>Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>The woman is about Sashi's size, though her appearance is nothing alike.</font><br>
[Sun Feb 12 21:01:23 2006] : <B>Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>They're headed in the direction of the Ntada Street. One advantage, for Sashi, of the corporate nature of the campus is that outside of shift changes and lunch hours, the place is nearly empty.</font><br>
[Sun Feb 12 21:02:00 2006] : <B>Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>There's a stretch midway there that is shielded from view, where the street passes under a building.</font><br>
[Sun Feb 12 21:02:28 2006] : <B>Sashi</B>: <font color='#004040'>Sashi shadows them until they split up</font><br>
[Sun Feb 12 21:04:44 2006] : <B>Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>It doesn't appear they're going to; instead, they're headed toward the restaurants and shops.</font><br>
[Sun Feb 12 21:07:18 2006] : <B>Sashi</B>: <font color='#004040'>She keeps following them, wondering if she can catch them woman in one of the bathrooms or something not unlike it.</font><br>
[Sun Feb 12 21:09:00 2006] : <B>Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>They pass through the shaded underpass and go into the mall; there are too many people here for Sashi to follow them while hidden, and her clothes might make her stand out from the crowd.</font><br>
[Sun Feb 12 21:10:03 2006] : <B>Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>Before they get too far, the woman notices the stain on the man's lab coat and points it out, he grimaces and trots over to one of the shops, holding up a finger for her to wait.</font><br>
[Sun Feb 12 21:10:22 2006] : <B>Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>She sighs and goes to lean against a wall fairly near the entrance.</font><br>
[Sun Feb 12 21:10:56 2006] : <B>Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>People are coming and going, but good timing might allow a score.</font><br>
[Sun Feb 12 21:11:24 2006] : <B>Sashi</B>: <font color='#004040'>Sashi sneaks up and around the corner in a lull in traffic and grabs her, dragging her back and into the alley quickly.</font><br>
[Sun Feb 12 21:11:25 2006] : <B>Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>It's mid-morning, so the mall isn't terribly populated.</font><br>
[Sun Feb 12 21:12:42 2006] : <B>Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>There may not be an alley per se, but the arches of the galleries on either side provide for decent hiding spots.</font><br>
[Sun Feb 12 21:13:05 2006] : <B>Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>At least for the brief time it would take to steal the lab coat and ID card.</font><br>
[Sun Feb 12 21:14:27 2006] : <B>Sashi</B>: <font color='#004040'>Which she does.  Dragging the woman as far back out of sight as she can, she puts her to sleep for a little while, takes her coat and ID card and takes off.</font><br>
[Sun Feb 12 21:15:00 2006] : <B>Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>All right; nobody in this area is expecting trouble, so your entire adventure goes unnoticed.</font><br>
[Sun Feb 12 21:15:05 2006] : <B>Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>Next step?</font><br>
[Sun Feb 12 21:15:56 2006] : <B>Sashi</B>: <font color='#004040'>Sashi finds somewhere secluded, gets dressed and goes back to the tower, doing her best to get in with a minimum of notice.</font><br>
[Sun Feb 12 21:16:59 2006] : <B>Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>The guard seems pleased to see a new face, and says something that sounds like an inquisitive greeting.</font><br>
[Sun Feb 12 21:17:00 2006] : <B>Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>Is Sashi stashing her knives somewhere before going in?</font><br>
[Sun Feb 12 21:17:50 2006] : <B>Sashi</B>: <font color='#004040'>Yes, WHen she got dressed she buried them in an awfully convenient patch of bare earth.</font><br>
[Sun Feb 12 21:18:37 2006] : <B>Sashi</B>: <font color='#004040'>Katars make good trowels.  She knows that.  Or she would if she knew what a trowel was.</font><br>
[Sun Feb 12 21:19:43 2006] : <B>Sashi</B>: <font color='#004040'>Sashi smiles what she hopes is a genuine smile and nods at his enquiry, and keeps going in.</font><br>
[Sun Feb 12 21:21:46 2006] : <B>Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>As she passes by, he glances over at the other side of the white box that "read" the ID card; it has text on it. He turns around to Sashi and barks something inquisitive and challenging.</font><br>
[Sun Feb 12 21:22:05 2006] : <B>Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>By this point, Sashi is past the checkpoint; the stairwell is within two long steps.</font><br>
[Sun Feb 12 21:22:31 2006] : <B>Sashi</B>: <font color='#004040'>She doesn't even bother stepping them.  She leaps onto the hand-rail and slides down it.</font><br>
[Sun Feb 12 21:23:41 2006] : <B>Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>Each flights of stairs is fairly short; the stairwell goes down at least two stories before giving out into a small cavern. At its far end is a heavy metal door, which is already sliding open. Sashi feels her ID card vibrate slightly as this happens.</font><br>
[Sun Feb 12 21:24:59 2006] : <B>Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>The heavy door leads into a long narrow hall with another door at the other end.</font><br>
[Sun Feb 12 21:25:14 2006] : <B>Sashi</B>: <font color='#004040'>Sashi moves with all speed towards the door, but conciously tries not to be seen at the same time.</font><br>
[Sun Feb 12 21:25:15 2006] : <B>Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>The security guard makes it to the bottom of the stairs in time to duck under the first door as it closes.</font><br>
[Sun Feb 12 21:25:50 2006] : <B>Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>He yells something challenging, drawing a metal baton; he isn't brandishing it yet, but the threat is there.</font><br>
[Sun Feb 12 21:26:22 2006] : <B>Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>He places a fingertip on his own ID card, and draws a semicircle on a certain spot; the far door stops opening before it's more than a few centimeters off the ground.</font><br>
[Sun Feb 12 21:26:31 2006] : <B>Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>This leaves you trapped in the airlock with him.</font><br>
[Sun Feb 12 21:26:54 2006] : <B>Sashi</B>: <font color='#004040'>Sashi rolls her eyes and sheds the lab-coat</font><br>
[Sun Feb 12 21:27:28 2006] : <B>Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>He doesn't look like a fighter, despite a physique showing gym work.</font><br>
[Sun Feb 12 21:28:22 2006] : <B>Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>He watches Sashi for aggressive moves, repeating his challenge.</font><br>
[Sun Feb 12 21:29:30 2006] : <B>Sashi</B>: <font color='#004040'>Sashi walks forward slowly, her hands open and before her.  Suddenly she raises them, and mimes two people talking ot one another with them, cocking her head back and forth, apparently following this silent conversation.</font><br>
[Sun Feb 12 21:29:58 2006] : <B>Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>He squints at this, not letting his guard down.</font><br>
[Sun Feb 12 21:31:32 2006] : <B>Sashi</B>: <font color='#004040'>She wasn't counting on that, but still holds his attention as she makes the two talkers begin to fight.  She steps in closer until she's in range, and her fist lashes out, connecting in a rabbit-punch with his throat.</font><br>
[Sun Feb 12 21:32:23 2006] : <B>Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>Ah, if she's walking toward him, he definitely backs away and snaps for her to back off.</font><br>
[Sun Feb 12 21:32:29 2006] : <B>Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>His meaning is clear despite the language barrier.</font><br>
[Sun Feb 12 21:32:54 2006] : <B>Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>(Also, a rabbit punch is when you beat down someone's guard with repeated quick overhead blows; you may be thinking of a sucker punch, which is any unexpected cheap shot.)</font><br>
[Sun Feb 12 21:33:03 2006] : <B>Sashi</B>: <font color='#004040'>(Well damn... she's been walking towards him this whole time)</font><br>
[Sun Feb 12 21:33:27 2006] : <B>Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>(Right, I didn't really notice that part the first time you said it.)</font><br>
[Sun Feb 12 21:33:55 2006] : <B>Sashi</B>: <font color='#004040'>(No, a rabbit-punch is also when you make a sort of half-fist by curling your fingers over in themselves, but not into the palm, and stroking with the middle-bones of the fingers)</font><br>
[Sun Feb 12 21:34:22 2006] : <B>Sashi</B>: <font color='#004040'>(striking*)</font><br>
[Sun Feb 12 21:34:57 2006] : <B>Sashi</B>: <font color='#004040'>(You don't hit as hard, but it still puts the full weight of the arm behind the punch)</font><br>
[Sun Feb 12 21:35:13 2006] : <B>Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>(Ah, the "crab shell fist.")</font><br>
[Sun Feb 12 21:35:47 2006] : <B>Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>Anyway, if you want to get to him, you'll have to just go slug him.</font><br>
[Sun Feb 12 21:36:01 2006] : <B>Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>He's not going to fall for anything overt.</font><br>
[Sun Feb 12 21:36:06 2006] : <B>Sashi</B>: <font color='#004040'>(okay)</font><br>
[Sun Feb 12 21:36:47 2006] : <B>Sashi</B>: <font color='#004040'>Sashi darts to the side, planting one foot on the wall of the chamber and kicking off, aiming to kick him up under the jaw</font><br>
[Sun Feb 12 21:37:45 2006] : <B>Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>He isn't expecting this move, so when he tries to swing his baton to parry Sashi's attack, she isn't there.</font><br>
[Sun Feb 12 21:38:04 2006] : <B>Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>Instead, he manages to move his weight forward right into her foot; he gets knocked to the ground and dazed.</font><br>
[Sun Feb 12 21:38:11 2006] : <B>Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>He's not out, but he's doing a standing eight.</font><br>
[Sun Feb 12 21:38:19 2006] : <B>Sashi</B>: <font color='#004040'>(a what?)</font><br>
[Sun Feb 12 21:38:49 2006] : <B>Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>(Another boxing term; if you get knocked down, you get a count of ten to stand up. So you get to one knee and wait until eight, resting as much as possible.)</font><br>
[Sun Feb 12 21:39:13 2006] : <B>Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>(If you got knocked down, then jumping right back up is the sign of an overeager rookie.)</font><br>
[Sun Feb 12 21:39:33 2006] : <B>Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>(In this guy's case, there is no ref and no rules -- he's just stunned, and slowly staggering to his feet.)</font><br>
[Sun Feb 12 21:40:36 2006] : <B>Sashi</B>: <font color='#004040'>Sashi lands on her feet and brings her fist solidly down in the middle of his head when he's in the middle of getting up, so his knees can't buckle to cushion the blow.</font><br>
[Sun Feb 12 21:41:50 2006] : <B>Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>He falls to the ground and lies there. If he's not knocked out, he's in no hurry to stand back up.</font><br>
[Sun Feb 12 21:43:38 2006] : <B>Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>(From the other room, I heard Dave giving some orders over voice chat in World of Warcraft... after a long string of "you, do this, you, do that, everyone else heal so-and-so, all {class} attack {enemy}," he added, "What we're trying to do is impossible.")</font><br>
[Sun Feb 12 21:43:39 2006] : <B>Sashi</B>: <font color='#004040'>Sashi tugs his belt off and hog-ties him with it, shoving him into a corner next to the first airlock door.  Picking up her coat again she puts it back on, and approaches the other door.</font><br>
[Sun Feb 12 21:43:59 2006] : <B>Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>(Apparently a boss engaged them while they were fighting a batch of his minions.)</font><br>
[Sun Feb 12 21:44:28 2006] : <B>Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>The other door is still stopped just a few centimeters off the ground.</font><br>

[Sun Feb 12 21:45:15 2006] : <B>Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>(It's Sashi's move.)</font><br>
[Sun Feb 12 21:45:26 2006] : <B>Tancred</B>: <font color='#000080'>(Sashi moved. Look back.)</font><br>
[Sun Feb 12 21:45:55 2006] : <B>Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>Right, she approached the door; I explained that it's stopped a few centimeters off the ground.</font><br>
[Sun Feb 12 21:46:34 2006] : <B>Sashi</B>: <font color='#004040'>And her ID card isn't activating it like it did the other one?</font><br>
[Sun Feb 12 21:47:03 2006] : <B>Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>It did before, but the security guard shut it down by drawing a semicircle on an area of his ID card.</font><br>
[Sun Feb 12 21:47:18 2006] : <B>Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>The gesture left a semicircular design on the card.</font><br>
[Sun Feb 12 21:48:19 2006] : <B>Sashi</B>: <font color='#004040'>She lets a huff of air out in consternation, and picks up his card, looking at it and wondering what would happen if she draw it back the other way.</font><br>
[Sun Feb 12 21:49:00 2006] : <B>Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>That doesn't do anything.</font><br>
[Sun Feb 12 21:49:33 2006] : <B>Sashi</B>: <font color='#004040'>She grabs his unconcious hand and tries it using his finger instead, in case it's keyed to him.</font><br>
[Sun Feb 12 21:49:51 2006] : <B>Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>That does the trick; the doors resume their normal function, and the far door begins to slide back open.</font><br>
[Sun Feb 12 21:50:23 2006] : <B>Sashi</B>: <font color='#004040'>Sashi sticks the card between his teeth and heads out the other door.</font><br>
[Sun Feb 12 21:50:35 2006] : <B>Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>On the far side of the door is a long hallway that leads way beyond the boundaries of the surface tower.</font><br>
[Sun Feb 12 21:51:23 2006] : <B>Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>But the item of greatest interest to Sashi is the nearest doorway&#8212;it leads into a circular cavern laboratory full of odd metal apparatus.</font><br>
[Sun Feb 12 21:52:10 2006] : <B>Sashi</B>: <font color='#004040'>She slips inside, automatically looking for cover.</font><br>
[Sun Feb 12 21:52:11 2006] : <B>Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>And at its center, resting on a thin metal pallet, is someone dressed like Tancred... Sashi can't be completely sure if it's Tancred or not, because he's lying face down... and the entire back of his head has been removed.</font><br>
[Sun Feb 12 21:52:57 2006] : <B>Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>Several thin metal arms hover over the exposed red and gray matter, engaged in an intricate dance; occasionally little lights spark out.</font><br>

[Sun Feb 12 21:53:37 2006] : <B>Sashi</B>: <font color='#004040'>Sahi, no stranger to the more gruesome side of life, raises her eyebrows slightly, and instead of looking for cover, looks for things suitable for use as weaponry.</font><br>
[Sun Feb 12 21:53:58 2006] : <B>Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>A weary-looking woman is hunched over a long low desk, whose surface is a magical window looking down on a filtered view of Tancred's brainscape.</font><br>
[Sun Feb 12 21:54:35 2006] : <B>Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>She occasionally making sketching gestures on the desk, and the arms change their actions; since she's the one coordinating the mechanical surgery, knocking her out might endanger Tancred's life.</font><br>

[Sun Feb 12 21:55:50 2006] : <B>Sashi</B>: <font color='#004040'>That's okay, for now.  Sashi just feels naked without a weapon, so she'll try to silently acquire one, then hide.</font><br>
[Sun Feb 12 21:57:54 2006] : <B>Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>There are a few things around; some odd metal implements which, whatever their scientific uses, could probably be used to whack people.</font><br>

[Sun Feb 12 21:59:24 2006] : <B>Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>The woman nods to herself and walks across the room to check on the contents of some alchemical devices; a combination of beakers, retorts, and obscure machinery is producing some sort of viscous fluid.</font><br>
[Sun Feb 12 22:00:22 2006] : <B>Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>The man Sashi stalked earlier hurried into the room, in a state of great agitation; the woman Sashi mugged is not in evidence.</font><br>
[Sun Feb 12 22:00:51 2006] : <B>Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>He jabbers something, and the woman responds with alarm; she takes one more look at the alchemical product and seems to deem it sufficient.</font><br>
[Sun Feb 12 22:01:45 2006] : <B>Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>She hurries back to her window-table and sketches out more orders; the mechanical arms begin to work busily, rerouting blood vessels and apparently undoing whatever they did to Tancred's brain.</font><br>
[Sun Feb 12 22:02:11 2006] : <font color='#0000ff'><i>whispering to Sashi,  Gaim seems to have frozen on me; give me a minute</i> </font><br>
[Sun Feb 12 22:02:52 2006] : <B>Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>Silvery filaments snake out of the gray folds and retract into a golden ball; another arm takes a small amount of the purplish fluid from the alchemical machine and drips it liberally on the exposed tissue, even as another arm carefully replaces the back of Tancred's shaved skull.</font><br>

[Sun Feb 12 22:04:21 2006] : <B>Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>The woman makes a wiggling gesture with her hands, and a diagram of Tancred's bones appears; the cracks are disappearing as the salve does its work.</font><br>

[Sun Feb 12 22:07:13 2006] : <B>Tancred</B>: <font color='#000080'>(And serve him bloody well right, too.)</font><br>
[Sun Feb 12 22:07:25 2006] : <B>Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>Yes, the tube has been there all along.</font><br>
[Sun Feb 12 22:07:57 2006] : <B>Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>(Well, Arno decided that two foreigners bumbling around the city would draw twice as much attention; and Tancred's the scholarly one.)</font><br>
[Sun Feb 12 22:08:03 2006] : <B>Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>(And he can speak the language, which Arno can barely do.)</font><br>
[Sun Feb 12 22:08:09 2006] : <B>Sashi</B>: <font color='#004040'>Sashi, being the uneducated person that she is, takes this to be the most expedient course, and yanks the needle from his arm.</font><br>
[Sun Feb 12 22:08:51 2006] : <B>Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>The needle did carry the sedatives that were keeping Tancred under; they'd already stopped carrying the pure anesthetic. Nonetheless, the drugs necessary for that kind of surgery are going to be in his system for a while yet.</font><br>
[Sun Feb 12 22:09:22 2006] : <B>Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>The lab does have plenty of dark corners, and heavy machines that are easy to hide behind.</font><br>
[Sun Feb 12 22:09:37 2006] : <B>Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>But once that guard comes to, he'll know what to look for.</font><br>
[Sun Feb 12 22:09:52 2006] : <B>Tancred</B>: <font color='#000080'>Tancred's arm flops off the table, all the reaction he makes to the needle's abrupt departure.</font><br>
[Sun Feb 12 22:10:11 2006] : <B>Sashi</B>: <font color='#004040'>When Tancred doesn't come aorund after about a minute, she sticks the needle back from whence it came, puts his arm back on the table, and hides again.</font><br>
[Sun Feb 12 22:10:53 2006] : <B>Tancred</B>: <font color='#000080'>Relieved of the worst of his troubles along with his consciousness, he looks sterner than she is used to.</font><br>
[Sun Feb 12 22:11:16 2006] : <B>Tancred</B>: <font color='#000080'>If there is peace in his face, it is at best a wary and uncomfortable one.</font><br>
[Sun Feb 12 22:11:31 2006] : <B>Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>Is Sashi just going to wait for further developments?</font><br>
[Sun Feb 12 22:11:53 2006] : <B>Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>That's not necessarily a bad course, and it's certainly the most practical.</font><br>
[Sun Feb 12 22:12:34 2006] : <B>Sashi</B>: <font color='#004040'>Yes.  She figures she's going ot need these people to bring Tancred around and get him out of there, and since she can't order them to do it, since none of them will understand her (presumably) she hides and waits.</font><br>
[Sun Feb 12 22:12:46 2006] : <B>Sashi</B>: <font color='#004040'>(with her club and Sharp Thing in hand)</font><br>
[Sun Feb 12 22:15:04 2006] : <B>Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>Well, after a while, Joster and her assistant come back, this time with the other assistant and the security guard in tow; the guard seems intent on doing a search of the room, but Joster sends him out with a peremptory wave.</font><br>
[Sun Feb 12 22:16:19 2006] : <B>Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>From her vantage point, Sashi can see the magical table Joster was using to view Tancred's brain; its view now zips around the room, and Joster and her two assistants show up as bright moving spots on a gray background.</font><br>
[Sun Feb 12 22:16:42 2006] : <B>Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>Sashi shows up as a dimmer spot, hidden behind one of the large engines, peeking out from between two pistons.</font><br>
[Sun Feb 12 22:17:21 2006] : <B>Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>Joster doesn't give any appearance of noticing; she just pushes a few buttons, and liquids gurgle around in the tube leading to Tancred's arm.</font><br>
[Sun Feb 12 22:18:03 2006] : <B>Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>She and her assistants pass the time by studying printed maps of Tancred's brain, and decanting the purplish alchemical mixture into vials.</font><br>
[Sun Feb 12 22:18:17 2006] : <B>Tancred</B>: <font color='#000080'>(so Sashi managed to hit the vein? wow)</font><br>
[Sun Feb 12 22:18:42 2006] : <B>Tancred</B>: <font color='#000080'>(she has a promising career as a phlebotomist)</font><br>
[Sun Feb 12 22:18:51 2006] : <B>Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>(Not really; they just didn't think that anyone had tampered with the tube.)</font><br>
[Sun Feb 12 22:18:58 2006] : <B>Tancred</B>: <font color='#000080'>(Oh, okay.)</font><br>
[Sun Feb 12 22:19:01 2006] : <B>Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>(I guess they'd notice that the liquid isn't going anywhere, and adjust it.)</font><br>
[Sun Feb 12 22:19:14 2006] : <B>Tancred</B>: <font color='#000080'>(Or his arm will suddenly be decorated in horrible bruising.)</font><br>
[Sun Feb 12 22:19:38 2006] : <B>Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>(Eh, it's probably under minimal pressure.)</font><br>
[Sun Feb 12 22:19:38 2006] : <font color='#0000ff'>Sashi (exit): 22:19</font><br>
[Sun Feb 12 22:19:44 2006] : <B>Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>(Whoops, another blip.)</font><br>
[Sun Feb 12 22:19:47 2006] : <B>Tancred</B>: <font color='#000080'>(Oopsie.)</font><br>
[Sun Feb 12 22:22:15 2006] : <B>Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>(Hm. Wonder if he conked out entirely?)</font><br>
[Sun Feb 12 22:22:27 2006] : <B>Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>(Could have been a blackout or something. I think he's mentioned having those.)</font><br>
[Sun Feb 12 22:22:31 2006] : <B>Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>Log off.</font><br>
[Sun Feb 12 22:22:51 2006] : <B>Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>I was just going to let Tancred convince Sashi to drink the Kool-Aid, thus fixing up her own brain problem.</font><br>
[Sun Feb 12 22:22:51 2006] : <B>Tancred</B>: <font color='#000080'>I dunno. Wonder what the Melbourne weather is like.</font><br>
[Sun Feb 12 22:23:04 2006] : <B>Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>They had to analyze his brain to figure out what had been done to it and come up with a cure.</font><br>
[Sun Feb 12 22:23:47 2006] : <B>Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>Of course, their price for fixing the compulsion will be to help them solve the Lakaira Corporation's monster invasion problem for good.</font><br>
[Sun Feb 12 22:23:49 2006] : <B>Tancred</B>: <font color='#000080'>Heh. That would take some doing, I'm sure.</font><br>
[Sun Feb 12 22:24:13 2006] : <B>Tancred</B>: <font color='#000080'>Oh, I daresay he'd be willing. He can't get any closer to Lucrecia at the moment anyway, and he's curious.</font><br>
[Sun Feb 12 22:24:16 2006] : <B>Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>Oh, since Sashi doesn't understand anything they're saying, Tancred could probably tell her something believable.</font><br>
[Sun Feb 12 22:24:47 2006] : <B>Tancred</B>: <font color='#000080'>Are they going to have to split her skull too, or does she get spared that little detail?</font><br>
[Sun Feb 12 22:25:08 2006] : <B>Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>Nope; they can just inject it, now that they figured out an antidote.</font><br>
[Sun Feb 12 22:25:21 2006] : <B>Tancred</B>: <font color='#000080'>Cool.</font><br>
[Sun Feb 12 22:25:25 2006] : <B>Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>They aren't going to bother to try to explain it to Tancred and Sashi, but both the poison and the cure involve nanomachines.</font><br>
[Sun Feb 12 22:25:36 2006] : <B>Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>Joster had to figure out what to program them to do.</font><br>
[Sun Feb 12 22:26:07 2006] : <B>Tancred</B>: <font color='#000080'>Did they fix up his hand, while they were at it?</font><br>
[Sun Feb 12 22:27:03 2006] : <B>Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>Hm, probably not, though if they noticed, they probably at least slapped some mending salve on it.</font><br>
[Sun Feb 12 22:27:12 2006] : <B>Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>That should have been enough to reduce it to a dull ache.</font><br>
[Sun Feb 12 22:27:35 2006] : <B>Tancred</B>: <font color='#000080'>He'll be pathetically grateful for that. He's not used to extended periods of pain.</font><br>
[Sun Feb 12 22:27:50 2006] : <B>Tancred</B>: <font color='#000080'>Probably dulling his brain as badly as the compulsion.</font><br>
[Sun Feb 12 22:28:41 2006] : <B>Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>True; not even professional tough guys can just ignore pain, after all.</font><br>
[Sun Feb 12 22:28:55 2006] : <B>Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>You just learn different ways of pushing it aside.</font><br>
[Sun Feb 12 22:29:09 2006] : <B>Tancred</B>: <font color='#000080'>Yep.</font><br>
[Sun Feb 12 22:29:22 2006] : <B>Alan</B>: <font color='#800040'>In the Dragonhunt, and in a few cases in real life, you can learn to completely ignore it through meditation and biofeedback; but that's dangerous.</font><br>
[Sun Feb 12 22:30:01 2006] : <B>Tancred</B>: <font color='#000080'>Obviously.</font><br>
[Sun Feb 12 22:30:12 2006] : <B>Tancred</B>: <font color='#000080'>Pain is there for a reason.</font><br>
[Sun Feb 12 22:30:51 2006] : <B>Tancred</B>: <font color='#000080'>Well, it looks as though Adrian won't be coming back, so I'm going to head for bed.</font><br>
[Sun Feb 12 22:31:03 2006] : <B>Tancred</B>: <font color='#000080'>Laters!</font><br>
[Sun Feb 12 22:31:11 2006] : <font color='#ff0000'>Disconnecting from server...</font><br>
[Sun Feb 12 22:31:14 2006] : <font color='#ff0000'>Game disconnected!</font><br>
